501,"This movie is probably the reason why so many people devoted their lives to worshiping the saga George Lucas had started three years earlier. Here the adventure continues, but with a twist - after having the basic characters thrown in the first one, here we get a souping-up, and everything and every one is multiplied by 100. The result is the best movie in the Star Wars saga. Here we have some rawness typical of A New Hope, and we still don't have the excesses of Return of the Jedi. The result is a brutally touching movie, where its characters are the main theme and not the battles or the special effects. Magnificent work by everyone involved, the movie is a triumph, and one of the best movies ever. John Williams also suceeds to beat his own work, and present us with a richly crafted score.",0.3812337662337662,0.47784271284271285

1148,"This is my number one movie of all time. It has a critical and personal touch to my heart. The Best Star Wars movie ever is also the Best Movie ever!! Right from the visuals, dialog and pace. Has anybody said that this installment (of the previous trilogy) has the best sound a picture quality? Someone was doing something right when they filmed this. Darth Vader has never looked better in a menacing way (I have not seen Revenge Of The Sith so I am not sure). Pay attention to the scenes when he is looking out to the stars for a hint of Luke. Man, I can keep going for hours on this one! The Hoth scenes were so goddamn priceless. Those Imperial Walkers scared the crap out of me when I was a kid. The Special Edition was a tough call, but I do have to say of all the last trilogy, this one had the best restoration. If you can, see the original cut of this, it was the way it was meant to be seen, with no tampering! Every time I tell people that ""Empire"" is my favorite Star Wars movie, they just look at me with disbelief and say ""... but Return Of The Jedi had a lot more action scenes...""

1210,"The Empire Strikes Back is, simply put, the best movie ever made. Who among us was not stunned the first time we heard Darth Vader's revelation to Luke? For all intent and purpose Darth Vader was just a robotic villian in A New Hope. Now he was a suffering man underneath that armor, one who just happened to be the father of the protagonist. This movie deepened the Star Wars saga in other ways. It introduced us to the Buddhist aspects of the Force through Yoda. Lando Calrissian was a smuggler with more intrigue than Han Solo in my opinion. Too bad his character was not further developed in Return of the Jedi. The visuals of Cloud City, with its pink and purple sky and dome shaped buildings, opened up the imaginations of so many children. We also got our first glimpse of Emperor Palpatine, although he was not yet truly brought to life until Ian McDiarmid played him three years later. Perhaps one of the finest scenes is Luke's journey into his dark unconscious via the cave on Dagobah. Of course, I cannot forget to mention the epic Hoth battle with the Imperial Walkers or the chase through the asteroid field.

Dunno why but the majority of the film is build around the evil of Darth Vader and his empire (more than once you will think of Third Reich-resemblances). The story itself is rather thin (in fact there is none as it feels like you're watching some episode, the movie doesn't even has an ending) but all the characters that made Star Wars such an immortal saga are back, and how...

This is evident in the leap in story depth and character development from A New Hope to Empire Strikes Back. Maybe he should have let someone else take over screenplay writing and directing after Phantom Menace. This film really does get deeper into the characters and is definitely the best film in the first trilogy. Sets are extraordinary and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian (aka the only black guy in George Lucas's universe) was excellent. They ended the film in a perfect place making the audience crave to know what happens next.

706,"Following the massive success for the first Star Wars film, George Lucas had hoped to become independent from the Hollywood system in choosing to finance the budget from the other two sequels himself. To develop the story for Empire Strikes Back, Lucas brought on sci-fi writer Leah Brackett to write the screenplay. In the first draft, Brackett would have Luke's father appear as a spirit to Luke thus tying into the backstory provided in A New Hope. Upon reading Leah's screenplay, George was less than pleased but before he could meet with her and fix the script, Brackett passed away thus leaving Lucas to write the next draft himself but he brought on Lawrence Kasden to reanalyze the screenplay. Unlike A New Hope, Lucas chose not to direct Empire Strikes Back because he was focused on running Lucasfilm as a business, overseeing the VFX company Industrial Light and Magic, and financing other Lucasfilm projects. George then offered the director's chair to his old film mentor, Irvin Kirschner. Known for more character-driven films like The Eyes of Laura Mars, Kirschner had never directed a blockbuster before and he originally rejected the offer, fearing the sequel wouldn't match the standard of the original film. When he called his agent, though, he later accepted the job at his agent's behest. Shooting for Empire Strikes Back began in Norway in early 1979 where they encountered the worst storm in 50 years with temperatures of -20 degrees and 18 feet of snow. On one occasion, the crew were unable to leave their hotel to shoot a scene of Luke escaping the Wampa cave so Irvin was able to achieve a shot involving Luke's exit of the Wampa cave by opening the hotel's doors and filming Mark Hamill running out into the snow while the crew remained warm inside. When the film opened in June of 1980, it did incredibly well at the box office and with moviegoers, but critics were mixed on the film, but over time, the film has been received far more positively and is now considered by many to be the best out of the entire Star Wars saga.",0.1692982456140351,0.43586523125996807

While the first film touches on Luke's destiny, in 'Empire' Luke begins to see the potential of his power, and also sees the temptation of the dark side. Where this film succeeds where the others fail is in the psychology of the film. Luke realises that his own worst enemy is himself, not Vader. Vader too is given far more scope in this film. We see his full range of his powers, his relationships with Imperial Officers, and more importantly with the Emperor. The climax of the film (Which I won't give away, just in case you've been living under a rock since 1980), ties up a lot of loose ends and intertwining stories from the film.

And of the Lord Of The Rings movies. Of every adventure movie I have seen, this one is the very best. Why, you will probably ask. Most people I know either prefer Star Wars IV or VI to this one. But I think they forget to take acquintance to the amazing chemistry there is between all the cast in this movie. And the classic scenes, there are many more than in the other movies. Luke meeting Yoda, and Yoda's amazing wisdom for such a small, little green alien. Vader confronts Luke. The truth revealed. Han and Leia's first kiss, and C-3POs interference. The introduction of Lando. Boba Fett. Admiral Piett's absurd rise to great Imperial stature. The battle of Hoth. Han frozen into carbonite. Just about everything of the dialogue, acting, everything of it is so classic, so climatic, so absolutely real. The Empire Strikes Back is the absolutely finest film in the entire Star Wars series.

Sure, there are cool aliens, action sequences, and all, but here the heroes have to deal with things us normal people also deal with.  Along with helmeted villains, snow monsters and the like, they face sexual tension, identity crisis, spiritual yearning, betrayal, parental issues, separation from loved ones, etc...  The pacing is just perfect, although there seems to be a screwed-up sense of time.  (Luke seems to be with Yoda for at least weeks, but the pursuit of the Falcon seems to take only a few days.)  The film is full of dreamy visuals--- a city in the clouds, a murky swamp planet, Kenobi's ghostly appearances, Luke's confrontation in the cave on Dagobah.  And the best part is the uncertain ending.  The bad guys seem to have won, and the heroes' fates are up in the air.  Definitely the best of the series.  Watch it again and again, it's worth it!",0.30624999999999997,0.543611111111111
113,My favorite scene of this movie is when Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader Duel with Lightsabers And I love how the Empire want to catch the Millennium Falcon and then put Han Solo in ice and how Yoda trained Luke Skywalker.

552,"Once again, George Lucas takes us to a long time ago in a land far, far away.  This film is a follow up to one of the biggest grossing movies of all time.  To tell you the truth, this movie was not that great.  The characters were further defined, but this film did leave enough out there to tell even the most novice of movie watchers that there was one more film to come (even if Lucas didn't tell us beforehand).",0.24375000000000002,0.64375

It is not just a living legend and a cinematic masterpiece, it is the sacred text of the mythology of Star Wars. A New Hope introduced us to the Star Wars galaxy and gave us a hint of its mythology, but The Empire Strikes Back created and entire mythology which ranks as the greatest imaginative exercise in the history of cinema.
