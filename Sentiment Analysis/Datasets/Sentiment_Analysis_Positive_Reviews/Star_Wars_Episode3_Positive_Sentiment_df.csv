But Its safe to say that I will. I haven't been at a movie in the past 10 years that I can remember enjoying this much. They told the story perfect in this chapter. I would have liked to have seen more wookie scenes but understand that the movie wasn't about that, and it would have taken away from the main story of Anakin turning finally to the dark side. Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it. The way Anakin turns to the dark side is very plausible. I enjoyed how things were cleared up between things said in the first episodes IV-VI. The people who are giving this movie a bad review must want to pick apart anything.

He is incredible!As for the death of Padme it seems to be unclear, i mean it's understood that she has no will to live, but still... Also the motives of turning of Anakin to the dark side are very simple, but so human! frankly i expected some more unusual reasons & motivations, but these ones are really close to each of us!",0.18423295454545455,0.4408834586466165

Never before have I seen so many brilliant actors, effects artists, set designers etc. produce such a steaming bucket of hamster vomit all because of a loopy director. I only hope that he stops killing Star Wars some day but I can only imagine he is doing something stupid like make a baby Jabba TV series. The only thing that mattered in all the prequels was the end scene of ep 3 and honestly by that point I didn't care. Actually at that point I wanted my money back. I think if the movies were dubbed with better dialog they could be saved but as they stand I feel they blow big donkey dongs. I was a huge Star Wars fan when I was young and after seeing the movies I have not spent one cent on any Star Wars related stuff. I know I can't stop George from flushing Star Wars away but I know how much money I spent on his world when I was younger and I know how much I could have spent now that I have a job and I didn't because Star Wars sucks now. The only thing standing in the way of me totally writing off Star Wars are the games.

2729,"In 1977 as i was 10, i went to the cinema, my father besides me, and we were witness of a scifi - fantasy becomes reality. It was great fun and some kind of magic. As i was older, i realise that the acting of the cast was not worth an Oscar, but it fits to what the story wants. A few years later, i saw the best scifi-movie so far ""The Empire strikes back"", a real masterpiece, based on but not directed by George Lucas. It was a milestone in SciFi - History. The third one struggles with the claim between a serious intended scifi-adventure and a childfitting teddybear-movie. A callow mixture that leaves a flavorless aftertaste. As like the Alien-Trilogy i thought, three parts are enough, the vertex is reached. Then in 1999, Mr. Lucas surprised us with the first part of the story, and for me it was like part VI but with sophisticated sfx. The second part was like a ripped off part of a memo, fast sketched and totally overloaded with sfx. Not bad, but not very good. To much visuals, to less story. But this third part is a deliberate insult in acting and storywriting. It just shows how blunted in the meantime the public became, that they were choosing this movie into the top 250.

The acting in this film was very flat at points, but George pulls you into a world of power excitement and leaves you breathless by the sheer scope of the world. The story here is brutally simple, but closer to the originals than episodes 1 or 2. This film, I believe, is what George wanted to make when he was thinking about Starwars. The sheer photography will leave you breathless, and the scope of things is absolutely massive. When you think about how this whole movie was shot in digital, you truly have to give George a hand.

356,"For the third time in six years, I left the cinema back in 2005 after a screening of the eagerly anticipated conclusion to George Lucas' Star Wars prequel trilogy with a smile on my face, and satisfied with a decent addition to the franchise canon. Yet again, as time went by, I felt my opinion towards the film rapidly decline after subsequent viewings. I decided to re-visit the Star Wars series again in the hope of finding some unique charm to the prequels, be it nostalgia or just my general love for the universe I frequently visited as a child. Yet there is little fun to be had with Episodes I-III, and the films now seem more rigid, humourless and just plain boring as they ever did. Revenge of the Sith does offer some slight relief however, and ends the trilogy on a minor high thanks mainly to a darkness Lucas had promised previously but failed to deliver.",0.0449223602484472,0.37741200828157356

Episode III is a highly enjoyable gatherer of loose ends in which there is no room for the comic/romantic light relief that spoiled ep I and II. Instead we are treated to lots of light sabering and the decent into badness of Hayden Christensens Anakin. The fact that Lucas was forced into a corner by story (this had to be about darth being born and major players dieing)has meant this movie has enough character and turmoil to save it from being a 2 hr effects demo. However its probably best for everyone, (the fancy dressed queues of fans included) that this sixth and third best star wars movie will be the last.",0.20373168498168498,0.35732600732600733
1052,"George Lucas is not an amazing director, he has been and never will be. The shots are very simple and there aren't any shots that truly capture the moment, this is due to the fact that Lucas relies on Special effects and the Star Wars plot to make him seem like a God. He is a great writer a director, and hopefully if he makes the next three (God I hope not), he leaves it to someone else. Maybe if the acting wasn't so damned stiff, you would care about the characters, especially when Padame was trying to get ""Annie"" to stop his Dark Side pursuits. It was just stupid, and the cheesy moment, the one that sent me over the top was when Lord Vader first rises and is informed he killed his wife, and he steps out like Godzilla with his new legs, throws his arms back and screams in a Godzilla like fashion. Damn you Lucas, damn you for your trickery, using special effects make nerds wet dreams come true (Albiet it did look abso-f**king-lutely fantastic, it just lacked in every other aspect) Natalie Portman is hot, in a weird pregnant woman/expecting mom sort of way, and no I'm not a pervert, I swear.",0.0647878787878788,0.5398008658008658

Within 2 minutes he is killing Jedi children without remorse when he had just shown remorse for being the reason Mace Windu died. George Lucas does not know how to direct people, that is why Empire Strikes back was the best, because he did not direct it. The movie altogether was disappointing.

The original Star Wars was gripping, edge-of-your-seat action that was way ahead of its time and although the story had many twists and turns in the plot, the real attraction was the special effects. It's possible that despite the effects that were put on screen in Revenge of the Sith, these movies were just made too late to really have the same effect on the audience. The cheesy, over dramatic lines put more of a grimace on the face of the audience than a look of delight, and the desire to have incredible effects from the filmmakers was overwhelming as you watched the film. Although the love story between Padame and Anikan was touching, the overall mood of the first two prequels was action.

2651,"They say the conclusion ties all the loose ends and brings everything together. That's exactly what George Lucas did with his third (and sadly final) epic film. Even when this movie first came out, I knew it was going to be bigger, better and above all: far more physical than the other 'Star Wars' films. Now there's really no comparison to the original trilogy to this chapter, but when you think about it this really is the episode that sets the stage for ""A New Hope ('77), ""The Empire Strikes Back ('80)"" and last but not least ""Return of the Jedi ('83)"" What made this the best prequel was the story, the emergence of the continuing saga of the battle between good and evil and most of all: the lightsaber duels including the one between friends turned enemies Anakin (now Darth Vader) and Obi-Wan. Although that ended in a tearjerker finale when a good person turns to evil and of course is told who he was and what he was supposed to do since he was ""the chosen one!"" How it begins seems like just another fight amongst the galaxy, but how it ends completely sets up for what's bound to happen next which was depicted almost 30 years ago. For those of you who have not seen this, see it when comes out on DVD on 11/1/2005 or better yet: BUY IT!

1357,"Before my account got blocked, I had written that I saw this at the midnight screening. And I'll stay as true as possible to the other comment I wrote: this movie was amazing. Months of anticipation indeed paid off. This is easily the best of the six films. It sure as hell is the best of the prequels. Pros: Special effects were great, acting was better, dialogue was better too, plot, ENDING(really great), How Palpatine manipulates Anakin. Cons: Dialogue still kinda sucked-you knooooooow what I'm talking about. It wasn't that bad, but it almost killed the scene. Acting- still not great, but indeed, as I said before, better. Hayden Christensen does a better job, especially towards the last half hour. Actually, everyone does a better acting job in the last half hour. The Obi-Wan vs. Vader duel was excellent-all other duels suck compared to this one. Except Yoda vs. Sidious- that was the 2nd best lightsaber fight in the movie, but the best when it came to using the force. Obi-Wan vs. Grievous was OK, but the end of that fight, even though I read the book, was a joke. Dooku vs. Anakin? Nice pace, but a little too short. Mace vs. Palpatine was just there for Anakin to turn to the dark, but was decent nonetheless. My favorite part of the movie was the entire last half hour-from Padme landing on Mustafar to the end credits. The music was even better in this one. Overall, my ranking of the six are 1. Revenge of the Sith 2. Return of the Jedi 3. The empire strikes back (neck and neck with episode VI) 4. A new hope 5. Attack of the clones 6. The phantom menace. I cannot wait for the DVD on November 1st. You heard it was emotional, and it's true. Padme's death was emotional, as was her funeral. When Anakin choked her, it was one of the most emotional parts of the saga, not just the movie. The most emotional part of the movie? The delivering of the twins, especially Luke. The best scene in the movie? The birth of the twins and Vader getting the suit. The best part of that scene, was the first breath in Vader's mask. Powerful stuff right there. So, in short, this movie didn't meet my expectations. It absolutely shattered them. When the 2 hours and 20 minutes were over at about 2:30 am, I was wide awake. I got home at about 3 am and had school the next day. I was tired, to say the least, but this movie was worth it. Thank you George Lucas.",0.20062269819732503,0.46978473433697293
924,"Both my wife and I decided that the screening audiences had to have been too intimidated by George Lucas to comment on the fact that there is no dialogue or story underpinning the very pretty pictures. Maybe George just sees more in a scene than the rest of us and tries to minimize lines to avoid taking away from the pictures. Still this is at best boring, stilted, and at times comical in the inconsistencies of the actions, powers, and knowledge of the characters. Really, until the end no one is supposed to suspect that Darth is the father? Please! Everyone could have died at the end and there would be no sense of loss. I've seen them all from the beginning and after the first 3 there has been no quality in these films worth mentioning. The critics live in world of awe for the directors or executive producers and have had to swallow Kubrick's last picture and most of Spielberg's recent stuff knowing that they are addressing icons. Sorry. Nothing worse than genius that has lost its special gift. Few are great for a life time. These have left their great works far behind them.

1547,"I am really surprised that there are so many comments about how bad the movie is because of cheesy lines or plot holes or too much special effects, or how great the movie is because of the cool battles or the final revelations in the plot-line. What I did not see is what in my opinion is the essence of this movie - the story of betrayal, of a tragic turn-out of a life. I left the theater shaken, because the story so much relates to real life - it's always the best people that suffer the most. That is Anakin's sin - he is the most gifted, the most promising, and may be the Chosen One. So what he gets is hatred, envy, mistreatment. His best friend and mentor betrays him, in such a disgusting sneaky way. The love of his life does not understand him and denies him support. The Jedi council (that probably stands for a bunch of hopelessly senile conscious-operated opportunists) does everything in its powers to turn him to the dark side (including letting his mother die as a slave and not letting him save her). Everything the Jedi council does is a screaming example of injustice and short-sightedness. Is it surprising then that they not only miss Anakin's turning to the dark side, but also actually cause it? And not only that, they later even accuse him of betrayal (!!!), Obi-Wan's arrogance (or maybe bad memory?) reaches the skies - after making Anakin believe that even Padme had betrayed him (by sneaking on the ship), after cutting off his legs, he leaves Anakin all burnt over, as he says - to the will of the force. What a masterpiece of hypocrisy! Fortunately, there is someone that does care for Anakin and he survives. Obi-Wan's arrogance has another dimension too - he spreads the rumor that Darth Vader hunts down and kills all the Jedi, while apart from the quite accidental death of Mace Windu, Anakin does not participate in any murder. Well, apart from the kids, which Anakin would never have done, if Lucas didn't have to put it in the script to justify his being a bad guy, while the Jedi are the good guys. He just had to do something horrible, otherwise the Jedi would have undoubtedly be considered by everyone in the Universe the worst villains ever. At least finally we had the pleasure of their removal from the world for good (except Luke though). Given how these supposedly high-moral-values knights give away centuries of education and training at the first sight of threat (""we should not kill unarmed people, but, damn, it's not that a big deal""), their extinction really brings joy to the heart. All in all, the world's a dark place and Anakin's fate confirms that - not only does he lose his loved ones (wife and unborn children), but is even denied his so-much-earned revenge - most of the Jedi are dead, and only after many years he gets to face Obi-Wan.

While a lot of dialogue in it is a bit odd, and the romance aspect of it can be a bit much sometimes, lots of those aspects have been put in a different light to me from the millions of memes created from this movie alone. This movie also does a great job of connecting episodes 1 and 2 with the original trilogy in ways such as revealing the Venator class Star Destroyer, showing how Palpatine was able to wipe out the Jedi, seeing how Luke and Leia were hidden away on different planets, the rise of Darth Vader, and many more things.

I felt let down that we didn't get to see him being a great Jedi. I didn't see him being great at anything, but whining. Obi Won kicked some major butt, and the fight scene at the end where Obi Won carved him up like a turkey was cool. It also didn't make any sense that Mace Windu could get the emperor on his back in a fight. Then Yoda turns around and gets his little green bottom spanked in a duel. Isn't Yoda supposed to be the best swordsman ever? And another thing that bothers me is, at the end the Jedi, we were led to believe that the Princess was raised by her mother. Now we find out that she didn't know her mother either, so that is kind of don't make any sense either because it comes up at the very end of the movie and Luke wants to know what his Mom was like. Leah say she was sad. Maybe she should have told him it didn't matter, because she was adopted. Seriously what did Leah's stepmother have to be sad about? There are just way to many let downs to go into. Watch it if you want. It isn't the greatest, but it is better than the last two.",0.19016594516594515,0.5353968253968254
435,"Star Wars III is perhaps on of the best films in the Series. Why do I say this? Everyone knows Lucas himself said this film would be the Turning of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader. A Jedi Knight into a Sith lord. The movie moves with a quick pace and it answers all the questions. How did the Jedi Die? How did Anakin become Darth Vader? Why does he wear that mask and Helmut and Armour? Lucas gives us all those answers and move crafting a incredible movie with a back story that leaves you saying yeah I know this but wow I didn't Know THIS!! Anakin Skywalker is worried about his wife's life pregnant with their first child Anakin is having troubling dreams foretelling her death. Meanwhile Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi are trying to end the Clone Wars. Skywalker and Kenobi are two of the most famous Jedi alive and their legends inspire people everywhere. They bring down Count Dooku and return Chanceller Palpatine home Anakin in talking to Palpatine unloads all of his feelings and fears and Palpatine sympathizes. Slowly bit by bit the chancellor is drawing Anakin into a web. Palpatine orders The Jedi Council to put Anakin on the Jedi council They relunctly comply but tell Anakin they will not grant him the title of Jedi Master.This drives a wedge between them and as palpatine draws them into a trap he gives them information that will lead the Jedi into traps. Anakin discovers the truth that palpatine is a sith lord and he is trying to tell Anakin he alone possesses great powers that can stop Padme from dying. Anakin goes to Mace Windu and tells him and as MAce Windu goes to arrest Palpatine a great battle ensues in which Palpatine drops all pretense and battles the Jedi master meanwhile he draws Anakin further in. Anakin helps kill Mace Windu and He is overcome with guilt but Palpatine soothes him and promises to make him the greatest Sith lord ever it is time for the Jedi to die. Anakin Skywalker bows down to Palpatine and rises as Lord Darth Vader. Then The order is given and Palpatine goes to the senate and tells them the Jedi tried to take over the senate they injuried him in order to protect the Senate he is creating the first galactic Empire and he will be the Emperor. all of this is fine great even but the moment has come that everyone has wanted to see. Obi Wan Kenobi VS Darth Vader. The climatic battle is everything we wanted it's fast and it gives us thrills as Vader and Obi Wan move closer to their destiny Vader eager for the kill Obi Wan not so much he much rather talk Vader back to the light side. then..Vader Lunges at Obi Wan as Obi Wan Hold the high ground and disarms him leaving him for the lava. It's a emotional moment as Obi Wan Cries out to him. ""You were the chosen one you were meant to bring the force into balance not leave it in darkness,You were supposed to destroy the sith not become one of them.You were my brother Anakin and I Loved you"" To which a Enraged Vader can only scream""I HATE YOU""! the film ends with Vader being placed in his armour and Obi Wan and Yoda helping padme deliver the twins Luke and Leia and they watch her die. The film ends with the twins placed in their new homes And With Obi-Wan helping watch over Luke.

I recall having people asking why any of Episode I was important. But it was. When Episode II was released, people asked why things happened the way they did. But they had to.

I loved the transformation from Anakin to Vader when the camera is at Vader's POV and the mask slowly comes down and locks in place. A few things that made me cringe were the shot when Yoda is falling off the pod in the senate and his claws scratch off the side like on a chalkboard. That made me feel a little queasy...

It wasn't about making money for him (Some of it was, but we are all motivated by greed in some way), it was about telling a convincing story of the rise of the empire and fall of the good. The Clone Wars series really made this film go from a 7 to a 10 because you create an emotional attachment to these characters and feel sad when things go dark.

Again I thought the story was more than okay, very enjoyable, so again no complaint from me here. By watching the saga in chronological order you get some surprises earlier than in order by release date but that doesn't bug me at all. The best thing about this movie and probably all the others are the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, I just love it. Some CGI's are better than others, but it's not really an issue as the futuristic landscapes and sceneries make up for it. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected.

Ewan McGregor proves far less irritating and dull than in the two previous episodes, but he just fails to deliver emotional content, as is the case with much of the dramatic material. With a plot revolving around treason, identity, guilt, scheming, an almost Shakespearian plot, there was more than enough to write something riveting, but - and here are maybe the limits of such a film - the director has visibly so much designed his film to suit an all-age, international audience, that the result only brushes the many issues, each time avoiding to delve into any of them, and so remaining superficial at best. The scene when Anakin surrenders to the dark side, a supposed climactic scene, is surprisingly devoid of any depth and pathos, as is Vador's confrontation with his master. Similarly, the attack of the Jedi temple by Anakin could have been a heart-tearing sequence, especially since we know Anakin will have to slay innocent and pure kids that simply trust and revere him, but no, the scene is left for the audience to imagine. What about the love story? Can't it be something else than this pre-teen infatuation, especially since it is one of the defining element in the course of the action? One of the things that have certainly appealed to early fans and enthusiasts is the bestiary and the variety of planets and stars where the action is set, but here again, most of of them are reduced to a simple glimpse. OK, Lucas is no Shakespeare and no Herbert (whose ""Dune"" has suffered from its successive on screen adaptations accordingly), but a deeper look into the material would have brought the film the credibility it definitely lacks. I believe the success of a tale depends on the person who tells it, not on the raw material.

2450,"After reading other reviews of Revenge of the Sith, I just have to say, while it was a good film, but it wasn't great. First of all the good points were that it was the best Star Wars prequel (easily). This was due to the characters actually acting (unlike the previous films)and the story flowing together with no real stops for unnecessary plot and not flowing too fast (like the first hour of TPM). This is shown in the fact that Anakins fall to the dark side did not happen all of a sudden, the audience could actually see his downfall. The special effects also made the fighting sequences enjoyable to watch. However, this was really all that was good about the film, and it didn't save it from the biggest reason why I didn't like it. In the original trilogy Darth Vader was someone that actually did strike fear into people, but this film ruined that image for me. Sure, I have to admit there has to be a reason why he turned to the dark side, but the fact when you see Anakin in his Darth Vader armour and he acts like a soap opera character just ruins it completely. Also the other 'major villain', General Grievous, was just pathetic. Whats so scary about an old man dying of bronchitis? Finally, Darth Sideous, while acting rather scary, was not as big a threat as the Jedi make him out to be. The fight between him and Yoda was more a stalemate than a victory for Sideous, so the fact that Yodas so scared of him makes me think that the Jedi are just wimps. In conclusion it was a good film, but Revenge of the Sith is not the best Star Wars film and has ruined the rest of them.",0.1264953542392567,0.4939508323654665

The only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow--and I mean slow--build-up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when that finally comes, it's pretty all right. Not great. Not even good. But pretty all right. This movie is being vastly over-praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels. Instead it's just turgid, dull, and routine. But you have to say, wow, those CGI environments are really impressive at times. Bu the lightsabre fights? They're all a blurry mess. I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed. This will make a ton of money, but thank god it's over, this once-worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough. I saw the 12:01 show, and after it, I heard a group of very small kids say, wow that was awesome! But everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle.

McGregor, Oz, and Jackson make the prequels worth watching, and as I said before this is a good film, but to say it's the best Star Wars film is a long shot for me. The prequels took focus from the stories away in favor of world building, but this film focuses back on the story and puts things on track to stick the landing. (albeit a little bumpy) This definently has some of the best sequences and scenes in any SW film. The Mustafar fight, Order 66, General Grevious vs Obi-Wan. As I said before the visuals for this film have become SOOOO dated it's not even funny, normally I wouldn't complain, but The Lord of the Rings came out around the same time, and this is Star Wars they are known for there Visual Effects. Hayden Christiansen's acting is bad, but I blame that on Lucas' direction, and Portman clearly just isn't into it (feeling more like a daytime SOAP actor, and yeah I know Star Wars is like a soap opera, but it's also a big budget blockbuster movie, so come on.)

640,"I just went to see this piece of crap of a movie. Basically, its a story of how Anakin Skywalker went to the ""Dark Side"" of the force. Something that could have been summed up in one paragraph of dialog in any of the other Star Wars episodes. The Battles throughout the movie were very ""70'ish"" and lacked any of the eye popping, jaw dropping capabilities of CGI available to filmmakers today. I wont point out any one in particular but just say ""The Actors"" appeared bored with the script. They put nothing into it. The words just came out like they were reading the script as they went along. Maybe this movie should have been called ""Attack of the Acting Drones"". This is a ""War"" movie, plain and simple. There was no need to throw in all the mush romantic dialog. We see that Anakin got his woman pregnant and gave up being a good Jedi Knight for her. Bull. The fact is that most of the script revolves around Anakins ""Wanting More"", something not good for a Jedi Knight and a ""Sure Path to the Dark Side of the Force"". He wants to control death, have the ability to bring the dead back to life or some such, he wants to be a Jedi Master. He wants too much. (Of course I suppose thats also why he wants to control the Empire as well, cause he's a ""Jedi in Need"".) Personally I fell asleep 3 times as the movie is extremely slow throughout. There are moments of excitement, but thats about it, a few moments. Boring movie, lousy uninspired writing, goofy romantic story, and 5 seconds of Jar Jar Binks, thats the only redeeming quality of this 3 star trash pic.",0.008630952380952375,0.46143077601410926

3000,"Thinking back on The Phantom Menace, which was nothing but poor acting in front of green screens, and Attack of the Clones, of which only meagre love scenes and a hilarious fight between Yoda and Count Dooku come to mind, Revenge of the Sith cannot possibly be any worse. Still, Episode III begins poorly, with emotionless performances from actors who have noticeable difficulty with acting in front of green screens. You almost start to think that the movie's title is nothing but an anagram, referring to the powerless impressions of constipated actors. Lack of emotion also arises because the Clone enemies are computer-generated robots. The special effects division seems to have taken over everything. What is it they want to prove? ""Look what we can extend for over two hours with less than ten live actors""? A turning point is reached when Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) fights General Grievous, the Clone leader. The story picks up speed, introducing human emotions, something that the first two prequels painfully lacked. Maybe Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) eventually turns over to the Dark Side a little too easily, but when you compare the arguments given to him by Ian McDiarmid's wonderfully overacted role of Chancellor Palpatine, to Windu's (a very miscast Samuel L. Jackson), you would probably do the same thing: Palpatine is by far the most convincing character in the movie. Anakin, now called Darth Vader, lets his anger and frustrations take the overhand as he joins the evil Sith. With this, the original Star Wars sensation finally surfaces, even though it comes in its darkest shapes. The final fight, although dominated by special effects, is very compelling and the way Vader is left for dead is bloodcurdling. The finishing scenes are meant to neatly tie up loose ends, securely linking this movie to the next (or is it: the previous?). Episode III finally brings emotion to the screen. Moreover, it succeeds in recalling the true Star Wars feeling. It's a nuisance that some shots are corrupted due to special effects overachieving (there are over 2,200 special effects shots in this film, more than Episodes I and II combined), and that some actors can't stand their ground in front of green screens but in the end Revenge of the Sith is by far the best of the three prequels.

But this one is in my opinion the second best Star Wars movie behind The Empire Strikes Back. I know there are a couple goofs, like how the Jedis Mace Windu brings with him to fight the emperor cant hold their own against him at all and die immediately; or when Darth Vader yells no in his weird voice and it ruins the sorrow of the scene. But at least there is no Jar Jar Binks like in the first two, or the Ewoks in the sixth. This is by far the most emotional and heartbreaking of them all with both Hayden Christensen & Ewen McGregor's portrayal of the characters drifting apart from each other. Anakin's path to the dark side is done well and played amazingly despite what some say about Hayden's acting. Hayden actually did an incredible job and when Anakin acts whiny, you can blame George Lucas for writing the character that way. But even then, people must realize that all the hardship Anakin went through would make life really difficult for anyone, so it's not all that surprising that he acts that way. It also makes him easy to manipulate i.e. Emperor Palpatine who used visions of Padmé dying to deceive him into obeying him and rebelling against the Jedi Order. This is of course no excuse for slaughtering the younglings or letting Mace Windu die. And by then there was nothing anybody could do, not even the two people closest to him: Padmé & Kenobi.

But it is still one hell of a fun action packed and engaging ride. Especially if one is familiar w the first three films. Definitely worth the watch. Just try to forget those first two ever existed. At the very least this film shows Lucas's visionary cinematic brilliance and his always ahead of the game grasp of modern film technology.

1828,"Having seen Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith at midnight I can only say: Wow! I might be a Star Wars Fan and therefore a bit too positive, but I can assure you, that Lucas perfectly manages to make Anakin's turn to the dark side credible. Hayden Christensen has grown to be a much better actor than we all thought after seeing Episode II and Natalie Portman is a lot better too. Actually Ewan McGregor, whom we all knew as the best actor from the previous movies, is now a little less convincing...But the best performance was shown by Ian McDiarmid, who is wonderfully evil and tricky. There is one big thing, that I really didn't like and that made me give the movie only 9 out of 10: General Grievous! How can anyone possibly like such a character? He is so much different from any other Star Wars character! Unelegant, stupid and getting on people's nerves. (from my point of view even much more than Jar Jar Binks or Boss Nass) But apart from that I can only say: Run into the next theater and see it! The connection between the new trilogy and the old one is now perfectly balanced and credible! George, you made it! And I believe I speak for all the fans: What you can do, can no one else! The film is really not to be seen by the very little ones, because it is very gloomy and sad. The atmosphere is a bit different from the other movies. I would say it is a better atmosphere, a bit similar to The Empire strikes back! Now, leave your house and get ready to queue, because Lucas strikes back! May the force be with you.

Everyone in the audience probably knew what would happen, Obi Wan and Anakin would fight and Obi Wan would win. Its the way it is, but people around me were still surprised, i was surprised. This movie was so amazing, The tremendous build up to the greatest fight in cinema history. I am serious, there is no other movie i have ever seen, and i have seen quite a lot. The duel between anakin and obi wan was so awesome. I personally own the movie and every time I watch when the fight begins, my blood gets riled up. I start humming to the music.

People are just so hungry to see something different in theaters after the previous 2 episodes that they jump for joy that this film has something other than pure trash in it.

1538,"Now I have to be serious. People, Listen. TO the fans that enjoyed this movie, you have great taste. In my opinion this is the perfect end to the greatest saga - Sci-Fi or not. To the ""Special"" people who gave it one, or two stars, where you really watching the same movie as the rest of us, or did your Brokeback Mountain DVD break from to much ""Enjoyment""? Huh, let's be honest, this movie was Fantastic. To start, the story between the lines has to be understood to truly appreciate this movie. Sideous' manipulation of Anakin. Anakin breaking the Jedi code and impregnating Padme. And finally his fall to the Dark side. This was a movie of all movies. The beginning was a total all out battle that was unreal. After all that goes on, with the war, General Grievous, and Count Dooku. Yes it is all there. However the main part of the story was the total downfall of Anakin and his becoming Darth Vader. Also of importance was the fall of the Jedi and the rise of the Empire. After losing his Mother in Ep II, Anakin would do ANYTHING to save Padme. Yes Sideous was manipulating him, However after Years in battle, Anakin was really in need of Padme and their Love. This movie has everything a Star Wars fan, Excuse me everything a REAL Star Wars fan could ask for. After Anakin was informed that Palpitine was the Dark Lord of the Sith, that was the moment in the saga. Anakin comes in as Sideous was ""being Arrested"" Sideous apparently set it up so he could be ""weak"" at Anakin's time of confusion. Anakin reacted. When he cut off Mace Windu's arm that was all Sideous needed. He disposed of Windu, and made Anakin pledge his allegiance to The way of the Sith. He was lost to the Dark Side.(Until the eventual redemption in Ep VI.) The ultimate battle (After the fall of the Jedi) Anakin vs. Obi-Wan, the best Lightsaber battle in the whole saga. This was mixed Nicely with the battle of Yoda Vs. Darth Sideous. In the end Most people knew how the movie would end. The ride to the end was Spectacular. THe end was all I expected and More.

1834,"This Star Wars movie is definitely one of the best I've seen in a long time. After being disappointed in the way Episode II turned out, I was uncertain of what to think when going to see Episode III. I mean, if you've seen the original trilogy, as most people have, then you are going to see a movie in which you already know the ending, since it leads up to what many of us have come to know as the story of Star Wars. I particularly enjoyed the battle sequences in this film. They did a great job in choreographing all the fights. Yoda kicks royal butt, the Emperor is a royal pain in the rear, but a good fighter anyway. If you enjoy classic light saber battles, you most certainly will not be disappointed in the battles found in this movie. Though some of the dialogue is a little lame, the action more than makes up for it. My favorite part of the entire film had to be the fight between Obi Wan and Anakin Skywalker. Even though I knew the outcome from having seen all previous Star Wars movies, I still was on the edge of my seat the entire time.

I hear all kinds of criticism of Lucas, but I don't hesitate in calling him a genius.

On paper, it sounds kind of stupid. But, somehow George Lucus creates an unbelievable film, from start to finish. The music is great and the plot is even better. It's a ""new"" age love story. The kind that nerds will like. The relationship between Ankain and Panmde is such a hard thing to watch. You know Ankain is going to the dark side and is leaving behind a wife and a child.

1542,"The first 3 Star Wars movies (Episodes 4,5 and 6) were of a different era, and remain great films. The latter episodes (Episodes 1, 2 and 3) seem to have gone steadily downhill, culminating in this last, disappointing installment. Lucas seems to have gone back to the drawing board years later, and just couldn't recapture the magic of his earlier films. I have continuously felt that the choice of Hayden Christensen in the pivotal role of Anarkin Skywalker/Darth Vader was a critical casting mistake. He was just too lightweight to carry that role. His acting is consistently wooden, and he never, ever made me feel he could be larger-than-life, heroic or ... Darth Vader. He seems petulant and immature throughout, and suffered next to better actors, especially Natalie Portman in their unbelievable romance. Almost all of their love affair seemed corny,stiff and embarrassing to me, never natural or magical. Often, the script-writing just seemed to fail the movie ... the dialog often felt flat and meaningless. Somehow, it just didn't 'click'. There were times when I felt that Lucas was trying too hard to cram all the plot elements in, to sew up everything. Most certainly this and the latter movies were overloaded with special effects to a fault. Naturally, there have been great strides in special effects since the earlier moves, but this isn't an issue of using better effects, but rather of over-using them; just overwhelming the plots and actors with too much going on, especially the battles. While some are great to watch, the overall effect is that they dwarf the human conflicts and smaller battles, kind of grinding down everything in their wake. After a while, the light saber duels were just redundant and tedious. I kind of liked Episode 1, although I think too much time was spent on the little boy and his big race. Episodes 2 and this, 3, were serious let-downs, as all of my comments above took serious hold. I'm kind of sorry for this, and almost wish Lucas could do it again better. As it is, we have to live with what he had created. Fact is that sequels rarely live up to the originals. The first three films were really one long one, and this follow-up of the last three films just couldn't maintain. Good eye candy, but they leave one feeling let down, not jubilant or inspired. I suspect that less discriminating viewers will find less fault with the latter films, but I think they are bound to rate second-best to the originals.",0.12116461394630407,0.4771182651464344

There were 2 things I liked about this film: the sweeping technological background animations, and the comparison of the emperor to George Bush. I have to give Lucas kudos on the Bush comparison especially. None of the other aspects of the film were interesting at all. The characters were dull, Obi Wan was a caricature of his future self, as was Yoda. The very fact of using computer animation in this film - in spite of the great backgrounds - was a betrayal of the original film. One of the things that made 'A New Hope' great was the delicate and subtle use of gesture to give character to creatures that essentially had no faces, like Vader, R2D2, and the rest. The use of true animation was pretty much restricted to ships in space in the original, while life forms were primarily puppets or humans. The subtlety and beauty displayed there were simply incredible. All that is gone in 'Revenge'.
