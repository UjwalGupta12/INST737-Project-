4240,"Regardless of the crying and moaning of the fanboys/girls who are just too connected with the VERY old films, and the trolls/haters hate comments, this movie is really good. Personally, I prefer this movie to the others. Most probably all the kids crying didn't get the god damn obvious message the movie was hinting throughout its entirety. Like come on.. You don't like the development of powers on numerous characters etc. but you love Luke kicking air, Bobba falling in the pit like a cartoon and the cringy alien songs? Really?

1275,"I am giving this movie 7.4 out of 10 stars but I kind of want to give it 6 out of 10 stars. The film looks great, and OMG the space battles are freaking awesome and.. that is about it. This is a spoiler free review so I'm going to try my best here. The acting is a mixed bag. Some of the actors are brilliant and others are sort of just there; but I'm not sure it is the actor's fault or if the fault belongs to the fact the story doesn't make you care or connect with some of the characters. It is hard to explain without spoiling things. The movie starts out great however the middle drags like a mother thanks to a subplot which is just meh. There are major things that happen, major things that are discovered and I am almost tempted to watch the film again just to see if eliminating the shock factors deflates the film even more when it comes to plot. Here is the thing, I am just going to come out and say it; I think the current trilogy (and extended SW universe) has no direction at all and each film they put out changes based on fan reaction. Say what you want about the prequels, at least they had a strong core story (Episode 1 is weak, Episode 2 is one of the worst films ever made; just so you know I am not a prequel fanboy). These new films feel like they have conveniently gelatinous core elements holding them together which are expendable based on viewer reaction. For example, if fans go completely insane and demand Episode 9 be a romantic French comedy shot in black and white - we are going to get just that. There is no backbone. Story wise this film is a bit of a jellyfish.",0.15040584415584418,0.5473845598845599
5343,"First of all I'm a die hard Star Wars Fan but not a blind fan. I coldn't quite feel the vibe when first I saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2005) but I was hoping that the story will progress and the Episode VIII is going to be another classic afterall Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a new chapter and sort of an introduction of the new characters and what the Star Wars Univers has became. I think there were many inconsistencies in the story I was hoping to get answers of many of my questions as the episodes continue. Altough I couldn't shake the idea of Disney owning the franchise and could deliver something good out of it. I was ready to give a cahance to new episodes after all it was STAR WARS!
I had high hopes for Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi and I couldn't help myself but to go to the first show of the openning week. I felt my skin crawling when the classic introduction text and music started to appear on the big screen of course there was no way of knowing this was the only exciting moment of the whole movie that was suppose to be another Star Wars classic!!!
The story was terrible. Director and the cast were equially bad although the acting were not bad but not good either. Disney must learn just adding the millenium Falcon and all other characters of the old Star Wars movie can't make a good Star Wars movie!. With episode VII I thought Adam Driver was a joke and disgrace to all the sith Lords before him (especially Vader). With Episode VIII he even seems more of a disgrace. His character is terrible as well. Probably the worst sith Lord ever. Kylo Ren often times acts very childishly throughout the movie rather than a powerful Sith master or he is too weak of a character for even a sith apprentice. A big scratch on the villain . The other characters of the movie are just ok and even Mark Hamill is not quite enough for to save the day. Without getting into the details there were few interesting moments of the movie. As for that I gave 2 stars instead of 1.
I think Disney should quit messing up with classical story and should focus on side stories and maybe never told stories as Rogue One was much better movie than Episode VII and VIII combined.
I have seen many better B Rated Movies than this one. Disney spent millions on GCI and models but all of them are not enough to save this one. Never quite belive that I was going to say this for a Star Wars movie but this is a serious waste of time and money.",0.04859684586247085,0.48372377622377627

5123,"Disney is destroying Star Wars. J. J. Abrams did a fairly good job with Episode 7 which was good, though Rian Johnson's Episode 8, just horrible! What is he trying to push here?
So much political correctness propaganda. Why can't Disney just stop pushing their politics and just make a good movie like they used to. Characters, animal rights, etc. etc. list is never ending! Almost on a regular basis there is a view something pushed on the viewer. So disappointing. You just want to enjoy a good film that compliments the last and prepare for the next.
Then the music in the battle scenes. Way over powering the scenes and sound effects. Would be nice to watch a good battle scene without just listening to some heavy music where you can't hear anything else happening in those scenes. Understandable it's good to have music, but in this episode, that's most of what you could hear in the theater in those scenes.

3251,"Just like the last film (The Force Awakens) you are either going to love it, or hate it. But I also noticed a lot of people are very much in the middle. I am one of those people. Yes there were some good elements that made me happy, but, there is a lot more issues then I realized walking out; after thinking more and more about it, the more I feel unsatisfactory. I'm not going to go into spoilers, I'm just here to tell you if it is worth the watch. Honestly, it is, but I wouldn't go rushing to the theatre to see it like with The Force Awakens. I'll start off with the positives, firstly, Mark Hamill gives the strongest performance of his career in my opinion, however some of the direction of the character was off. With that said, I felt fulfilled with how Luke was portrayed in this film. Adam Driver gives a riveting, and damaged performance as Kylo Ren, surely his character is a lot more interesting then Force Awakens. I am very curious what will happen to him next. Daisy Ridley as Rey was spot-on, so was her character in many ways. There is a little surprise in the film involving two characters which I felt satisfied with. Ok, those were the ups. As I enjoyed Luke, Ren, and Rey...thats about it for the characters. The others fell flat, Finn is remarkably pointless at this point, he has no arcs, no story, he's just there right now to give John Boyega a paycheck, good for him, but not for us. The Porgs are Fu--ing stupid in the worst way. They're just a dumb excuse to sell TOYS, but why do you NEED that for Star Wars? Doesn't Star Wars sell enough TOYS! When I saw them in the trailer I snapped, this is what Hollywood has turned to. I wouldn't mind so much if they had a purpose, other then to sell TOYS. They are not as annoyed as the Minions, but pretty close. Finn wasn't the only character who was pointless or unneeded, and some of the ways they handle the characters makes no sense, I would go into more detail, but I want you to go experience this yourself. But in my opinion, this film is worth seeing, just don't expect The Empire Strikes Back or anything. It proves that Disneyfying everything isn't always great.",0.1856269841269841,0.5307689594356261
301,No through narrative. A series of set pieces adding up to nothing. Second rate acting from Mark Hamill as he attempts to bring profound meaning to throwaway lines. Poor attempts at humour.

Rey has no backstory. (The movie takes pains to point out that she has no real story--weird.) Kylo is not intimidating, just a dithering weenie. Worst of all, Luke is no longer Luke. If you make the mistake of seeing this one, you'll find out what I mean. They absolutely trash Luke, the hero of the original trilogy. That's just mean. The movie is boring whenever it's not frustrating. Yeesh! All of this adds up to a movie that is actually WORSE THAN THE PREQUELS.

There's more boldness in the Times New Roman font. This instalment has evidently, looking at aggregated scores, polarised viewers. And I can see why. In this episode, the rebels attempt to flee from The First Order and it's up to Finn to retrieve someone to help them infiltrate their primary ship. Meanwhile, Rey tries to convince Luke to help the rebels and train her in the Jedi religion. That's pretty much as grand as this chapter gets. Where is the grandeur!? Where are the stakes!? Why am I not on the edge of my seat! No matter how aesthetically pleasing the visuals are, the constant feeding of nostalgia and the inclusions of a few memorable scenes...it doesn't make a film great. This episode is weighed down by underdeveloped characters, sluggish pacing and pivotal elements that are rushed. I have no doubt in my mind that Rian Johnson's directing style was glorious, in fact the technical aspects to The Last Jedi are outstanding. Visually I cannot fault the effects that are used and also appreciated the use of puppets and animatronics, particularly the Porgs which are bound to make Disney a fortune. Various memorable scenes, such as a cruiser lightspeeding into another ship, make for some general entertainment. But, I can't shake off the fact that I was bored. It took nearly half the film's runtime to get going and become interesting. Kylo Ren is the most intriguing character with plenty of internal conflict. Adam Driver gives a perfectly good performance, full of emotion beneath his eyes. I can see it! They just didn't explore his character arc or utilise him to his maximum potential. The Force Awakens introduces us to these fascinating bubbly characters that are just utterly wasted in this.

If it were 20 minutes shorter, it could have been something special, but the last act sees our characters in the exact same spot as they began. As a standalone movie, it's watchable. As the second part of a trilogy, it's a disaster.",0.0004761904761904708,0.471984126984127

This review is mostly about the stupid fans that go on about how bad this movie is and are really bad at criticizing the movie
This movie currently has a %53 on Rotten Tomatoes...
The My Little Pony Movie has a %80 and this just isn't acceptable...
Can people get their heads out of their heads and be reasonable for a second. This movie is currently being criticized for doing stuff different and ""destroying Star Wars"". God forbid the movie had creative minds behind it and was written excellently (at least for a blockbuster I wasn't asking for The Godfather and I didn't get it but the script is amazingly good still) 
These are probably the same people that criticized Force Awakens and Rogue One for being really predictable.Are you kidding people? Are you really butthurt over really good plot twists and change in Star Wars dynamics ? Do you need to know everything about a movie before it comes out ? Is this where the movie industry has come to. I'm seriously baffled because of these mindless reviewers and I'm siding with the critics for once. I'm more baffled at the people that give this movie 1 star. 1 star? are you joking. Even if you didn't like the plot or the changes, you gotta admit the acting is the best in the series, the visual effects are stunning, the movie has great direction (thank you Rian Johnson you beautiful beast), the soundtrack is also awesome, the action is probably the best in the series. 
So I'll like to go against some stuff that people got annoyed with
Leia using the Force? - Even tho we haven't seen Leia use the Force for lifting stuff but she was clearly Force sensitive because she is the daughter of Anakin and does have the Force to help her out.
Luke's character ark. -People are talking about this while Yoda literally did the same thing after ep III where he went to hiding in Degobah
Snoke wasn't explored well. -As much as I kind of agree with this but Snoke's character was already weak and as mysterious as he was he was pretty much a placeholder for Kylo to get in power and It gave us one of the most intense scenes in the series
Porgs? -I don't think much people are talking about them but they are awesome and adorable need one immediately
So please criticize movies reasonably and give actual good criticism.",0.18133680555555554,0.5543402777777777

6206,"This movie is not, by any means, a perfect film. However, I do think that there's something to be said about how ambitious, entertaining, and daring that this movie is. If you read some of the reviews on here, and other places on the internet, you'll see some common complaints such as ""Luke's character was ruined"" or ""entire plotlines were pointless!"" I address these two specifically because I believe that they were actually some of the best parts of the film. Luke's character was, quite frankly, improved. In the original trilogy, he was a hero in training who wasn't perfect and almost succumbed to the Dark Side. In this movie, he's a grizzled, old Jedi master who has his reasons for questioning whether to get involved or not. It makes him way more complex and also isn't something completely out of the character that was originally established. As far as the ""useless"" plotlines go, THAT'S THE ENTIRE THEME OF THE MOVIE! Failure is readily apparent in this movie and aside from the very end, characters both good and bad are constantly failing. Luke fails Kylo Ren during his training. Rose and Finn's mission ultimately fails. Poe fails Holdo by turning against her. Kylo Ren and Rey both fail to convert the other. Snoke fails to retrieve Luke's location from Rey. The entire Resistance pretty much fails to exist. Leia fails to get backup. It's everywhere in this movie and quite frankly, it's goddamn refreshing to not have the heroes succeed. I know I'm not addressing a lot of the complaints, but that would take ages (and plus a couple of them are actually good complaints.) The romance between Finn and Rose is REALLY bad. It didn't need to be there and it didn't really make sense. The movie also did drop a lot of things that were brought up in The Force Awakens, but the things that it did drop I feel like might make a return in IX so I'm not too upset. Production-wise, and I don't think anyone is arguing this, this movie looks amazing. Everything technical from the special effects to the cinematography, it's a beautiful movie. The acting and script were both also pretty good aside from a few jokes that don't quite land. Overall, this movie is damn good. It's hard for me to believe that anyone truly thinks that this is worse than the prequels. The prequels are quite garbage. You can like them, that's fine, but saying that they're better than this? Unbelievable. For my ranking, I personally would put it below The Empire Strikes Back and the original movie, but I would actually put it above Return of the Jedi.

5073,"I was raised on Star Wars, Star Trek, Lynch's Dune, and The Day the Earth Stood Still. My stepfather would buy the SW novelizations and I read them obsessively as a kid. I also read the kid series that he didn't buy (support your local libraries!). I think it's safe to say that I have some well-grounded, pertinent knowledge. I feel when rating a movie like this (with the well-publicized reactionary reviews) I have to present my bona fides first thing. 
I liked this movie a lot. Was it perfect? No. Was it the worst movie in the series? HAHAHAno. How does it compare with the original trilogy? I think it compares rather well. But that also means it suffers from some of the same weaknesses of the original series while facing an audience less willing to handwave said weaknesses away.
The main thing I saw people who weren't being reactionary complain about were plot holes. Were there as many as people say? Well...not really. The phrase gets thrown around a lot when people are ragging on a movie, but the accepted definition is still the one in common usage. There were plot WEAKNESSES, definitely, but a plot hole is a gap in the narrative that (and this is the key point) ""goes against the flow of logic *established by the story's plot*."" Which means if something follows the internal logic that has been established...it's not a plot hole. There were a couple narrative choices that made me roll my eyes, there were moments that seemed illogical to me but fit the previously established characterization, and there was one section that just seemed so pointless. I didn't like those bits and it took this movie from a 10 to an 8 (well, more like a 9.5 to a 7.5). They weren't plot holes, they were just poor choices.
Overall, I think this movie has a solid standing in the Star Wars pantheon. I know fans who raved and put it as their new number one, I wouldn't go quite that far. But it's definitely in the top half of my rankings.",0.08759469696969699,0.45925662878787876

First my main complaints. Yes the writing for Rose and Holdo wasn't good, I understood why they were there but they didn't add that much, Rose was just unnecessary but no where in a galaxy far far away as bad as jar jar, and Holdo is a character I feel would have had development in a previous movie but just wasn't pulled off right, bit swapping he rout for akbar wouldnt fix anything, in my opinion it would have detracted from the film.

3572,Apparently Rian Johnson had seen a great evil in Star Wars and in Luke Skywalker in particular that needed to be righted. It is the only way I can explain Johnson taking a big crap on the character. I don't know his motive but Johnson's message seems to be if you thought Luke Skywalker was the great savior of the resistance he's not. He's a piece of crap. If you thought Luke Skywalker was special he's not. Rey doesn't come from his privileged family and yet she's more powerful in the force than he is. If you thought Luke Skywalker was the most powerful Skywalker he's not. His sister could have been more powerful than him if she wanted to. And if you thought Luke Skywalker would be redeemed in the end he wont. The best he'll do is use all his might to pull off a David Copperfield magic trick and then fade away. Good riddance.

In the meantime, the New Republic - who we understand were until recently ruling the Galaxy - have the equivalent of a few jeeps and some AK47s. Although the Force Awakens is responsible for getting the franchise into this situation, the situation was not irrecoverable. However this film just digs itself deeper into that particular hole. Even the opening crawl gets it wrong: The very first sentence states that the First Order rule the Galaxy. Later on, it states that they are rising. Are the First Order ascending, or are they ascendant? How come the First Order are so powerful and the New Republic so weak?

2746,"Following the Force Awakens which was both a critical and fan hit, Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi had the highest bar to climb, and it manages to go a lot higher than the its predecessor. Rian Johnson's touch has elevated The Star Wars franchise by daring to take risks, and taking our beloved characters to a new level. 
This is a unique Star Wars film in its story telling aspects, in its humor, and in its style. This will drop as many jaws as I assume The Empire Strikes Back originally did. This is also the most beautiful Star Wars movie to date, with breathtaking Cinematography, Fight Choreography and Visual Effects. But Most importantly, all of these technical aspects are only there to elevate the gripping story and character arcs that Johnson has created. 
The Last Jedi is absurdly entertaining, gripping, and is also a mind bender. It will trick you, confuse you and ask you questions, only to pay them off and answer them in the most surprising and satisfying way possible. None of the main characters are one sided, as Rian Johnson manages to make you feel empathy for all of its characters, specially the main Villain, Kylo Ren. He remains a strong antagonist who is conflicted, but driven and you could say the same about our hero, Ray. Luke Skywalker is handled masterfully, and that's all I can say about him without going to spoilers. So much happens with him that is surprising, but fitting to his character. Mark Hammill shines bright, but the brightest star is the Late Carrie Fisher, as General Leia. It is difficult not to feel emotional every time you see her on the screen. She plays her iconic character as well as ever, and could not be in a better movie as her last. 
The Last Jedi has grand emotional gut punches, followed by great action sequences, including my all-time favorite _and for a lack of a better fitting word the most Badass_ scene in the franchise. However just like any film it has its flaws and I can summarize my main problem with the movie in one word: Porgs. These cute birds are only there to be adored and are only there so Disney can sell Toys, which we know brings a surprisingly large amount of revenue to the studio. In Contrast to the Porgs, I loved the cute droid BB_8 because he as so much purpose and he is vital in the story. The story also loses some of its emotional build up in one particular heavy scene towards the end, to throw in a joke which felt forced and unnecessary. Happily these two minor complaints get lost in this fantastic story. This is truly a great film, and you don't have to be a Star Wars fan to love it. Rian Johnson's different vision for this movie, has made me a lot more optimistic about the future of Star Wars, and his original trilogy.",0.2770492494518469,0.5881542699724519

There is no intention of spoiling the film for any potential viewers but all I can say is that you need to remind yourself why you wanted to see it in the first place. 
Now it's hard for me to objective about it because I was 7 years old when I went to see the original and have been an avid fan for the past 40 years but the whole purpose of a review IS to be subjective as it's solely your opinion on the film, nobody else should influence you into making a decision about what you expect from a movie. All I can say is that it met almost all the expectations I had and nothing will change that.
When I fell in love with the Star Wars universe I was a child, it gave me an opportunity to escape from being a schoolboy on planet Earth and drift off into a place that triggered marvellous things in my imagination, made me want to want to be a part of it and experience it, I absorbed it and let it invoke emotions in me through the entire spectrum that it could possibly have done. I was never interested in how great the script was, or the political messages behind the film or how hammy an actor was. 
So 40 years go by and I don't expect anything else from a Star Wars movie other than going through a gamut of emotion and being awestruck by the special effects and John Williams' mastery in film score writing.
It appears that people expect something that NONE of the other films were and will never be happy unless it becomes a serious story in it's own right. It was always meant to be a story for children ( the highest classification any of the movies ever had was PG-13) and to bring back the inner child for a few hours for the adults that go and watch it.

It is spectacular, massive and powerful to watch each scene and how fighting between 'good and evil' goes but in the end if you appreciate previous movies you will feel betrayed and probably get stunned by details but not in a good way. Return of our beloved Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) gives us a new way of confrontation which passes and gets you hyped enough to bite bait and focus on movie. On the other side there are characters that will make you wonder like Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and return of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) can get you real excited until further development or underdevelopment of characters goes through picture. Skywalker's contribution to story is pretty strong and mostly it feels constantly dragged toward his character. Discoveries throughout movie will keep it going and pull your focus to it with some stunningly scenes and landscapes because without any doubt it's one good looking movie. Now to get real with everybody there is so much need to tell you that movie gives some of the pretty laughable, ridiculous and stupid moments that if you really like movies you won't forgive. Rian Johnson, the director, man who also directed and wrote Looper which was fantastic, now gives every fanboy out there a material inside movie that will get them to the skies and beyond. Screenplay and directing done by Rian is fabulous without any doubt, it has some of the greatest fight scenes which look beautiful on big screen and you will definitely remember them. There is only one major criticism about characters is that Snoke got too little time and was so left behind and considering powerful man standing in his seat it could've been powerful performance. Overall experience of Star Wars: The Last Jedi without giving any spoilers that is very tough in such a movie is that it was well written and directed by Rian, followed by great performances but sometimes it felt that Johnson focused too much on fans of saga rather then to give us a more powerful story that he is capable of providing. 3/4 By the way Porgs are absolutely amazing.",0.17797336106159634,0.6446969696969697

1718,"I was truly disappointed with this film, I have been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember.This film almost seemed designed to ruin the legacy that George Lucas left with the originals. For starters, the fact that they had a side quest that took up half an hour of the film is taking the piss, and the fact that it's only purpose was to tell us that capitalism and animal cruelty was totally unnecessary.
The way that they handled the characters from the original trilogy was criminal, they killed off Admiral Ackbar like he was just a background character. Having never seen Princess Leia use the force, I was surprised to see her not only survive in space, but to also then fly back to the ship basically unharmed. Meet Princess Leia Poppins everyone. And last but not least we have Luke Skywalker, a character who saw good in Darth Vader, but will attempt to kill his nephew because he thinks that he will turn the the dark side is just ludicrous. The fact that they had time to show him milking an alien and yet no time to show emotion is simply ridiculous, and then have him beaten by someone who has only held a lightsabre twice seems like a total waste of time.
When the head of Lucasfilm was asked what she wanted to do with a new trilogy, her response was ""The main character has to be female"". I have no problem with a female led Star Wars film. I however do have an issue with Rey, she has no character development, has only used a lightsabre once and yet is now the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy. Finn does pretty much nothing throughout the film apart from kill Captain Phasma and then nearly himself. Poe destroys a Dreadnought in the beginning of the film (I know that it was Rose's sister) and is then sidelined by Admiral Holdo for the rest of the film.
The addition of Laura Dern to the cast excited me, that was until her character turned up and consequentially added an additional hour to the film and then kills herself in a role that was befitting of a good character. Snoke had the makings of an excellent villain, and then is killed off halfway through the film. Kylo Ren seemed to have a cool story ahead of him, but then this film happened and he was reduced to just another crying emo kid that like to show how swole he is.
And onto the worst character in the film, Rose does nothing through the film but say stupid things and bring us to canto byte.
Captain Phasma was a waste of time being given that she is only in the film for about two minutes and is then killed off.

367,"I love Star Wars. I was born six days before the release of the original; the Saga has been part of my life. I love the characters, the story, and the imagery. I love the behind the scenes history, influence on filmmaking, and cultural impact of the films. I grew up playing with the action figures, collecting the Topps cards (with dusty, razor-sharp shards of ""gum""), eating C-3POs cereal, listening to the ""You will know it is time to turn the page when you hear Artoo-Detoo beep like this"" records, playing the Nintendo games, wearing the shirts, reading the Expanded Universe, riding Star Tours, experiencing the Renaissance of the mid '90s. Star Wars was something that defined me. 
And then I saw ""The Last Jedi"".
This movie is insulting to a loyal and invested fan base. It is blatant arrogance to proclaim ""Let the past die"" when so many like me have been dedicated supporters of a franchise that permeated so many aspects of our lives. Star Wars is inextricably part of our past. To ""let it die"" trivializes the foundation of what has allowed these films to still be made 40 years later. Further, the filmmakers defend the poor reviews by blaming the fans for not embracing the desecration of our collective past.
""The Last Jedi"" is a fever dream version of Star Wars. It negates everything that came before it, including it's immediate predecessor. While ""The Force Awakens"" was a pale imitator of the original, ""The Last Jedi"" is so unlike any other Star Wars movie. Yes, there are superficial similarities: character names, weapons, ships. Gone is the grand, overarching story with historical and mythological undertones. Gone are the universally applicable lessons of overcoming selfishness and anger through maturity and sacrifice. Instead, we are given contradictory messages that only suit the plot (arms dealers are bad, but they supply the good guys; Admiral Holdo can sacrifice herself to save the Resistance, but Finn can't because of some line about not fighting the ones we hate, but saving the ones we love).
Like ""The Force Awakens"", character arcs are destroyed - characters are unrecognizable. Luke Skywalker, beloved hero of millions, is reduced to a pathetic coward just to justify Kylo Ren. Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio are reduced to props. 
I imagine that fans like myself get movies. We understand how fickle we are; we want something new, yet love our nostalgia. We get that the older characters should make way for new ones. But not like this. This tells us to jettison everything we love without offering anything better in its place. It's the same silly hubris that Disney pulled with the old Expanded Universe (the Legends); they proclaimed it all ""non-canon"", then gave us garbage like ""Aftermath"" as replacements. Yes, most of the video games, comic books, and novels were pretty bad - but they all had their fans! Star Wars really doesn't belong to any of us! We all played with our action figures differently as we created our own adventures and interpretations of the characters.
But Rian Johnson comes along like the rich kid who has all the toys and immediately tells us what Star Wars is or isn't? 
I know this is a long, meandering review. But I hate this movie because I love Star Wars. And I refuse to let Kathleen Kennedy tell me how to play with my action figures!",0.019378787878787884,0.5027348484848485

Rey trying to get attention from Luke 
Rey trying to connect with Ken and turned it to the light. 
Poe try to become a leader despite his rebellious attitude 
Fin trying to avoid war and find Rey and his friendship with a new female character that (as sympathetic as she is), does not add anything to the movie.
Fin trying to get a Master Hacker to save the rebels; a plot so absurd that looks was added later to give some emotion to the movie (and failed).

Snokes death: pros: he was never that intriguing to me anyways. His arrogance killed him much like it was the case with Palpatine. Cons: regardless of him being a stereotypical uber villain, he did seem to fill the part of main opponent, since Kylo Ren seems more like a study in angst. With Snoke, starkiller base and Snokes flag ship out of the game I have difficulty seeing the typical sense of things to take care of for our heroes in episode 9. 
Lukes death: pros: Actually liked the grumpy old man approach... cons: But spending Lukes life the way it was done seemed utter wastefull, regarding 35 years speculating what he'd be able to do as an old jedi master. It was, to me, a lack of ideas that made them spend him in an attempt to mirror Yodas serene death i RotJ. 
Hyperspace kamikaze: pros: looked cool. Cons: it changed the ""rules"" of all future space battles in Star Wars... The next time the rebel fleet is hopelessly outnumbered, hyperspace kamikaze as an option seems required. 
Reys family background: pros: Anakin came from humble beginnings also. Cons: dont serve up mysteries and then kill then so backhandedly as it was done. 
The gambling planet detour: pros: none. Cons: overall this side plot served no purpose at all other than screen time for main characters, introduction of benicios character which I didnt come to care for anyways and his final betrayel as a result was so anticlimactic. 
Captain Phasma: Again a totally wasted character... She be ""killed a third time"" in episode 9, as I cant imagine that falling into flames present her bigger difficulties escaping than being locked in a trash conpacter on an exploding superweapon.

3135,"Why in my personal opinion, Star Wars: the Last Jedi is my favorite Star Wars movie. Just to be clear, I love Rian Johnson, and what he wanted to do was burn Star Wars to the ground. Not because he hates it, but because he loves it. He loves it so much that he wants to cleanse the garden and allow something fresh and new to grow. The Last Jedi is not concerned about what fans think. It wants to challenge you and make you question what Star Wars is and what it can be. Subverting the tropes of s very predictable franchise, and making it something that stands out, something that people talk about, is so much better than just another Death Star. TROS for me is such a bad misunderstanding of what was supposed to come. This movie laid the groundwork for something completely new, and all J.J. and Chris Terrio could think of, was to have a thousand Death Star super weapons? Really? Rain Johnson should have done Episode IX. But I digress, From its opening scenes, The Last Jedi makes it very clear where it stands - everything you thought this movie was going to be is incorrect. The symbols you hold dear, the symbols that J.J. Abrams held so dear in your stead, are being deliberately stripped of their power. If that shakes you, if that upsets you...well, that's just Rian Johnson preparing you for what's next. Abrams left him with an ellipsis, a ""to be continued"" that felt like a specific path. And Johnson takes a hard left turn into what he wants to do. It's so great, it's so refreshing after The Force Awakens played it so safe. The irony is that Rian Johnson isn't your typical Star Wars fan, he reads the extended universe material, he watches Red Letter Media, and is known for stripping away the tropes of genres and making them fresh and new.

4167,"First off, I'd like to say that I loved this movie. I saw it five times in theaters and each time I noticed something new. I loved that Poe called Hux, General Hugs, and that BB-8 stole the walker. This is the type of comedy that Star Wars needs. It needs to be funny, to keep the audience interested, but not too funny because then you have, well, Jar Jar Binks. This is my favorite Star Wars movie, and I agree with most of the bold choices they made. It did start to get old after four and five times but you can't only see this movie once. I think two or three is the golden amount for a Star Wars movie in theaters. A lot of people said that it didn't live up to expectations, but I had just as many expectations. At the time of this review, I have watched the official trailer (ya know, the one that starts with ""when I found you"") 703 times! This was an incredible movie, and it makes me excited for the future of Star Wars. I think Star Wars is in good hands and Disney will take it places.
 Enough with the overview. Now I'm going to talk about what I loved and what I'd rather them change. I, like many other Star Wars fans, loved anything that happened in Snoke's Throne Room. It was unexpected and very cool. I also liked the reveal of Rey's parents. It shows that Star Wars doesn't have to revolve around the Skywalkers. It shows that almost anyone can use the force. Even though, I think Crait was underused and the chase through space was overused, what did happen on Crait was cool and true to Star Wars spirit and the chase in space added urgency to the situation that makes a Star Wars movie that much better. I think Luke dying added to the story. It showed that it is time to pass the torch and stop pestering over the original movies I, and many others, watched all those years ago. I liked how they had him die peacefully watching twin suns after sacrificing himself to help the rebels escape just like Old Ben did in the Death Star many years before. But every movie has problems, so now here are the things I didn't like about this movie. Number 1 is Leia Poppins. Even though the score in this scene is awesome, the scene isn't as good. It proves everyone's point that main characters have a protection shield. It would have been more powerful and a lot better if it showed her floating there while playing the soft Leia theme and just crossed out the part where she twitches and floats back. Number 2 is Canto Bight. I have no problem with Canto Bight, in fact, I think it's pretty cool. If you're skeptical over Canto Bight, read the Canto Bight novel by John Jackson Miller, Mira Grant, Rae Carson, and Saladin Ahmed. It's really interesting! Anyway, the reason why I didn't like Canto Bight was because it felt forced and out of place. I think they should have reserved Canto Bight for Solo: A Star Wars Story which will come out in May. I think it fits better in Solo than it does in The Last Jedi, considering Han is an avid gambler and smuggler. It would be a cool easter egg, though, if Canto Bight was where Han won the Falcon. Number 3 is Finn. I don't mean the character, I like the character, I mean his ""death"". I think it would be better if that whole part was cut or Finn sacrifices himself. It is a really powerful moment when he goes in for it, but Rose saving him, again, is rally dumb and feels like a main character shield. Either he sacrifices himself or doesn't even try. It feels like the story team was sitting around a table and they couldn't agree, so they compromised and that compromise is really bad. ""It's not fighting what we hate, it's saving what we love."" Yuck! This is Star Wars (emphasis on the Wars), what do you think this is, The Space Between Us?
 Overall, though, I loved this movie and I personally cannot wait until it comes out on Blu-Ray and Digital.

JJ Abrams set up a Star Wars trilogy with no idea what the answers to some of the big questions were (who Rey's parents are, Who is Snoke, etc) can you blame Rian Johnson for taking the movie in a different direction.
Out of everything we've seen in Star Wars over the years this movie was probably the most unique, different messages, new sets new ideas the fact that The Firce Awakens was rejected because it was too similar and The Last Jedi was rejected because it was too different is ridiculous. Not every film has to fit YOUR ideals, and just because it was a bit different doesn't make it bad.

3647,"I was excited for this Star Wars. I drove to my local theater through plenty of snow and traffic with some friends to see a movie I'd greatly anticipated. 
Walking in, I felt good, watching the first ten minutes, a high-paced action scene akin to great space battles before it, with great piloting by Poe, timely comedy and sacrifice scenes to boot that brought a new element of sympathy to the random characters we see die that we rarely spare much of a thought about. Had the whole movie been similar to this or even at least have the action scenes follow this mold, I would give this an 8 out of 10. Unfortunately, the final 140 minutes were a narrative mess without any direction or meaning.
Let's start this with some things I really enjoyed about this movie. The acting was fantastic, and you could tell everyone playing their characters really channeled their best efforts into this project. The score was fantastic once again, and so was the cinematography and special effects. The action scenes are well-choreographed, for the most part, and they didn't shove callbacks to the original trilogy as much as they did TFA.
However, once you get past the talented and passionate actors, effects workers, and John Williams, you find a movie truly lacking in the elements that made Star Wars such a great trilogy in the first place. 
I'm glad to see many reviewers also believe that the comedy in this film was sub-par. You never saw the on-the-nose forced humor from this in Empire, A New Hope, or even Jedi. Yoda burns the ancient Jedi scriptures as a joke, and then Luke, despite literally 30 seconds previous he was about to burn it himself, gets mad and tries to save the books. He also throws his lightsaber away when Rey hands it to him, which was cheap. There are just plenty of quips and one liners that aren't needed, to summarize. 
So many characters from The Force Awakens, the original Trilogy or even introduced in this movie are wasted by a script that doesn't know what it wants to do. Finn does nothing in this movie, besides almost run away, have a casino subplot that made no effect on the plot, and fight Captain Phasma for 1 minute. (Phasma was once again criminally wasted, and then killed off.) Maz could have been used in place of Guillermo Del Toro's shabbily introduced and shoved out character, but she was relegated to one scene where she fights off something we have no idea about. Yoda comes in for five seconds and does nothing except crack a few one liners and do what Luke was about to do. Snoke, who was intriguing, mysterious and incredibly powerful to the point where he senses his apprentice's intent? Just some nobody who gets killed off in a manner impossible not to see coming. R2-D2 served no purpose in the movie other than say hi to Luke, Chewbacca was basically some dude who flied the Falcon and couldn't speak, and while Leia actually was treated well in this, her god-like come back to life scene was astoundingly confusing. Poe was used to a serviceable amount, and had at least some character development. Laura Dern's admiral character was perplexing in many ways. She could have told her crew about her plan, rather than not say anything before she loaded the transports which rightly provoked a mutiny. She also waits until most of the ships have been shot down before reaching her plan to go to light speed and destroy the ship. Rose, played by Kelly Marie Tran, was interesting. Her character as a nobody in the Resistance who has seen friends and family die only to see her supposed invincible heroes disrespect that was something that could have been worked with and I hope that unlike many characters from TFA that we see her again at some point in a significant manner. General Hux also could have been used more than he was and was given little to do other than get intimidated by Snoke and Kylo.
The entire subplot with Rose, Finn and the Codebreaker only dragged the movie far longer than it needed to be and could have been shortened greatly with little effect on the movie, or even cut out entirely, since the tracking of the ship no longer was deemed necessary. Also, The Force Awakens leaves off on the Starkiller Base being destroyed, and then resumes in TLJ with the Rebellion being on their last leg, almost completely destroyed with no explanation for how.
Obviously I have to talk about the major deaths in this movie. Rather than kill off Leia respectfully, as she will not be in episode 9, or even in the scene where her cabin gets shot out and she climbs back into the ship somehow, they kill Snoke before anything is revealed about his origins, character or how he got to power. Luke's death, while interesting and needed to close out the plot TLJ was trying to tell with the end of the Jedi, epitomized the wasting of Mark Hamill's talent and love for this franchise. We never know why he gave up so suddenly, or why he wouldn't even contact anyone important from the original gang. Instead, he becomes an unhelpful and resenting hermit completely unlike Ben Kenobi.
Rey and Kylo Ren have the closest thing to character development in the script. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley were once again fun to watch and kept you on your toes, with their narrative of projecting to each other, to their fight scenes. However, Kylo goes from refusing to kill Leia, killing Snoke and helping Rey to immediately fighting her and making power grabs for the First Order. Once Luke's lightsaber explodes, we never see Rey again until she's in the Falcon again with Chewbacca, even though we never see her running away to get in the ship, or boarding it. She also does barely nothing in the final scene, where she definitely could and should have. 
Overall, this movie could have been one of the best movies this franchise has seen, yet instead it only barely holds itself up above the prequels. This is the worst Star Wars movie since Revenge of the Sith.",0.1410381411517776,0.5037586908041455

But not by mistake, or misinterpretation; the film challenges viewers to take everything to a whole new level. And this is the main virtue of the movie.

3469,"Let start that this movie is the end of a new beginning and many people that are star wars fan will be disappointed but for those that know that is the end of the line for the Skywalker family. This is the end and is the perfect beginning for a new trilogy. Director and Writer Rian Johnson did an amazing work together with the Disney story writer team. 
I went to the movie not expecting what I saw, specially Luke story Arc that was enough for me to prove that the movie had a point to teach us about Failure. Yes we don't have the heroes that we grow up seeing is true I wont take that away, but heroes to can fail and be weak and that is the greats teach in this movie. To accept our failure and take on responsibly of our mistake, Luke run away to hide from the mistake that he make with Ben Solo( Kylo ren) creating the monster that he so much fear.
Another point that I want to add is that many people are disappointed with who Rey real parents are and I even wonder did you really watch the FA because it was state very clear that her parents were No body. This also teach us that you don't need to come from a very special blood line to have that type of raw power, untamed power.
And that in mind is the main reason they gave the next trilogy to work on to Rian Johnson. He will bring a new generation of force user stronger than before in the force, he will bring the balance to this new uncharted territory of the universe of star wars.
I will have to say that performer wise Luke , Rey and Kylo were amazing and beyond my expectation the throne scene what a scene it was amazing and the slow motion that make my poor lungs to stop breathing for a second or how good and stratify was to see that scene breath taking. Humor level was good I enjoy Poe much more this time than in the FA. Finn and Rose story arc it was good and safe play, that what I felt the majority of the time that I was watching it, I even though for a second that I step in back in Hunger Games but let no go there.

 Leia did not fly children. She used the force to pull herself toward the ship and survive the rigors of space for a few minutes. Luke projects an illusion of himself to fool Kylo.

 Luke who for all we know changed tremendously in those 20 years. So he had a weak moment because he felt the darkness in Kylo ( much improved performance BTW ). He still wasn't going to through with it. Rey's parents turned out to worthless nobodies. Great twist. Vader's Mother has no powers either. So don't go there.
 No light saber battle. So what? A fantastic battle with (one can assume ) extraordinarily trained guards. Rey saved Rylo but he dispatched most of them. Snoke is his arrogance and self assurance didn't sense the lightsaber about to kill him. I could go on forever. Now there were some bad parts. The whole Casino subplot sucked. They should have let Finn die. Phasma was again a nonentity and Gleeson as Hux was way over the top. Leia in space was a stretch but these are minor quibbles.

2288,"It is three months since I saw The Last Jedi and every time I see something that reminds of the movie I am more convinced that Disney destroyed Star Wars. You take the Skywalker story of heroism and then betray it by turning Luke into a self-centered git, you basically add in Chewbacca, R2D2 and C3P0 as props since they have no organic role in the story, you create a bunch of plot devices that utterly lack foundation in the canon (e.g. Leia suddenly pulling her Mary Poppins self-rescue thru a Force she never learned to use, you build up a character like Rey (who is the single most humorless character I've seen outside of a Russian novel) and make her unbelievable mastery of the Force completely unearned... Well, Disney, you created a movie which is interesting and visually stunning but which is not Star Wars. ""Well, we're bringing Star Wars into a new place"" is so not an excuse anymore than it was when the ridiculous sequel to Gone with the Wind took Scarlett on a tour of Ireland and it no longer had any resemblance to the original book. Or imagine taking the Harry Potter franchise and turning Harry into an asshole in the last movie. Imagine how that would destroy the entire spell woven by the original movies. Well, Disney, that's what you did. Congratulations on letting your egos destroy something that was classsical, beautiful myth so you could put your stamp on it.

Sadly Carrie Fisher is no longer with us so I'm surprised Leia is still alive and Luke isn't. Also, the whole thing with Rey looking into the Mirror of Erised from the first Harry Potter was pointless and stupid and did not do anything for the plot. AND they killed off the potential of who Rey's parents could have been. JJ Abrams even said he told Daisy Ridley who her parents were and that they were something big. And then this new director just completely killed that idea. Phasma once again had only seven minutes of screen time and it ticks me off, I love Phasma and Gwendoline Christie and they just keep on wasting her awesome character. She is so much cooler in the comics. AND MY FINAL problem with the film was how Rose saved Finn, it made the whole him being a martyr thing stupid because we all knew he wasn't going to die. Now it wasn't all bad so here is what I loved and honestly what gets it a six from me and not a four. I loved how they went more in depth with the actual Star Wars Universe by that I mean the creatures and the planets. It totally felt like star wars, I like how they did Ben Solos turn to the Dark Side and why it happened, and I liked Poe's character development in this film.

In the E.U., Luke is the strongest Jedi the universe has ever seen but in TLJ he is depicted as a coward and a quitter. Once he finally does something halfway cool, he dies from exhaustion. The entire plot of the movie makes no sense as all the First Order has to do is send a few ships ahead of the rebellion convoy, via light speed. to cut them off. The entire plot line with Fin and the Asian girl added nothing to the movie and basically could have been left on the editing room floor. We waited two years to find out who Snoke was and they kill him quickly, without any explanation of his backstory. This is the powerful nemesis we've been postulating about? Oh, and Rey is a nobody from nowhere. I get what the director was trying to do, the Force resides in everyone and can be expressed anywhere, not just in the Star War legacy family lines...I just felt there was so much more opportunity here that has now gone wasted. BTW, not one mention of the Knights of Ren? It's as if this director forgot there were a previous move (Force Awakens) that he was supposed to tie into.
There are some cool scenes but the movie jumps from one scene to the other so quickly that the viewer doesn't have time to absorb it fully. It's like this movie was created for an ADD kid, the Millennial generation. Also, there is a lot of misplaced humor, inserted into serious scenes inappropriately, and then just ignored for the remained of the scene. IMHO, this is sign of an inexperienced director that was not ready for such an undertaking.

Good to see Mark Hamill (he was good in this). Overall, it was about what I expected; awesome and awful; if only they didn't have those annoying, little, cutsie penguins; Chewy's trying to fly the Millennium Falcon, and fighting a battle and these penguin thingy's are sitting on the dashboard: WTF!? This is becoming like Transformers; those movies would be okay if it weren't for these annoying little toy transformers thingy's buzzing and hopping around; it spoils the tone of the film.

6644,"So we went to see Last Jedi for the first time after work Thursday night. I will say it's not as bad as The Force Awakens which was just a rip off of A New Hope. Last Jedi at least has some sort of story line, though I can't say it's one that was very rich, made much sense when looking at the other films, or contributed much in any way to the legacy story other than destroying a lot of it. I guess when the guy who you let write and direct this film was a non-speaking actor in Rogue One, you can't expect much. I give it 2.5 of 5 stars and just as with The Force Awakens, I will likely never see it again. Even the prequel trilogy was better than this. Oh yeah one last thing, because it's now property of Disney they're trying to be all inclusive and add more diverse characters. I don't think a pointless 10 minute arc of film just to create and then get rid of a character that happens to be asian just for the sake of it is really being diverse. In my opinion that was tacky and no better than the horror films that used to kill off the one black person in the movie first.",0.03779987373737374,0.36442550505050514
4711,"I don't really get why so many people hated this movie. As a Star Wars entry, it's pretty decent. 
I only have one complaint: it needed more aliens. Star Wars is a space opera. A big part of the magic of the first movies was being transported to a universe bursting with alien species interacting with each other and humans being thrown in the middle of that endless ocean of space oddities.
This movie is too human-centric. Where are the Yodas, Jabbas, ewoks, etc....? (yes, I even almost missed Jar-Jar Binks... almost). Even Chewbacca was relegated to being a f...ing extra in this movie. I'd be surprised if his total screen time exceeded five minutes.
Star Wars is not Battlestar Galactica. Bring back the magic! Make the next one more epic!
Like I said, this one was a decent Star Wars. Better than the prequels, not even close to being as good as the Empire Strikes Back though, despite what's been said by some idiotic critics.

My top Issues:
1. This film turns Leia into Superman - i honestly burst out laughing in the cinema when it happened, because it was so unbelievable!
2. Luke is totally out of character - how can he possibly doubt Kylo Ren, when he never lost faith in Darth Vader, and Vader was a million times more evil than Kylo Ren
3. The male-hating Vice Admiral Holdo - the most annoying and cringe worthy character ever in a Star Wars film, makes Jar Jar Binks look loveable
4. The entire Casino storyline, which ultimately was completely irrelevant to the main plot, and seems like just a ploy to make more toy merchandise
5. The complete anti-climax of Snoke, who was portrayed as this huge villain and ended up just an easy pushover
6. And best for last - the absolutely ludicrous ""Holdo maneuver"". If this really was a thing, why didn't the rebels use it to destroy the Death Star in Star Wars? Hyperspace ramming should have been the rebels' top weapon from day one!",0.14919871794871795,0.6355769230769232
4944,"Last Jedi was wonderful for everyone who didn't take a deep dive into theories on the origin of characters.

But Phasma is no different from beloved Boba Fett. Rey's parents are no different than Anakin's parents. Star Wars fans have recently bathed themselves into the idea every character needs to somehow be connected to another to be significant. 
If you don't feel that way and love seeing the story unfold, Last Jedi will be a film you'll watch over and over. Also, Johnson has taken the powers of the Force to a new level , past just mind tricks and moving rocks. With the Force, users are capable of much more than we ever expected.
