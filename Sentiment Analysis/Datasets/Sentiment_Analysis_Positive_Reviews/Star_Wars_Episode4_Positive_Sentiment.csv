109,"Star Wars was my first non-Disney movie that I watched at the ripe old age of 8. Immediately I fell into another world, getting caught in a new mythology from a Galaxy far, far away. My siblings and I would play ""Star Wars"" in the back yard, saving the galaxy from evil. We would try to make my cousin into the ""A New Hope"" version of Princess Leia; my sister's hair was too short. My best friend at the time and I would be Jedi knights - we were 8 so it was okay to do this.",0.12024793388429753,0.5038567493112948

1036,"I cannot recall when I saw this film for the first time but what I do remember is how captivated I was by it. I had not seen anything like it before even though I had seen most of the original Star Trek episodes. This film set the standard which other films had to try and equal, emulate and improve on and from what I have seen of the films that have been made since very few come close for the overall effect this film had on me. For me Like all great films is has no flaws it is just nothing short of breathtaking. It is over thirty years since it was made and it could have been made last week. Technology has moved on apace from 1977 but this film is more than just a series of special effects and good acting. The story is told in only two hours a fact which still amazes me when I watch it again. I know there are people out there who don't like films set in space but I suspect if you give it a chance like a friend of mine did and watch it all you may well have a change of heart as she did.

He got lucky with the first one (this film) because it was a product of its time and was what people WANTED to see in 1977 - something hopeful and fun. Remember - or maybe you are too young to remember - movies in the mid 70s were extremely cynical post Watergate and post Vietnam. This one was different and even religious in an ecumenical way. Lucas got lucky with the second one because of the director and his input. To me, all the ones that came after The Empire Strikes Back were special effects filled duds.

730,"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is a wonderful feature. Acting is great, between spot on casting and largely convincing dialogue that delivers fulfilling character development. The emotional depth is also nicely crafted, although somewhat rushed early in the runtime, likely to move the plot forward into more intense moments. Despite this mistake and other plot holes, the story is still well written and largely intriguing for the audience. Comedy also thrives due to the chemistry the cast has. Visually the film excels, aided by a great score that promotes the adventurous yet also fear inducing tone created. The resolution is too quite satisfying, even if it feels slightly predictable. Overall, a truly great feature that began such a rightfully beloved saga.",0.3037549407114625,0.6175889328063241

I was drawn into it immediately, and was in awe throughout. The movie has all the elements you could want in a movie. It has an intriguing story, action, humor, romance, cool special effects (pre-CG, but way ahead of their time in 1977), a tremendous musical score and has moral lessons about greed, temptation, sacrifice and loyalty. Good and Evil are clearly defined and the fight of Good vs. Evil is the central theme. George Lucas and his extremely talented crew got everything everything right in this movie. The movie benefited from two previous Lucas projects. THX-1138 and American Graffiti. STAR WARS blended Lucas' interest in technology with warm, human, defined characters.

1851,"I'm a big fan of a sci-fi literature and have read a lot both in Russian and English. The reason I'm putting my comments here is my curiosity. There's a Russian sci-fi book ""Tumannostj Andromedy"" written in 1930 by a Russian writer Ivan Efremov. The main character's name is ""Dar Veter"". What is it a coincidence, that it closely resembles ""Dar Weider"" in the Star Wars series, hardly ever because the spelling is too close. I'm not sure when the book ""The Star Wars"" was written, but it sure looks that someone liked the name and used it, but who? I wonder when The Star Wars was written? Maybe earlier, like the 20-s?

320,"Star Wars: Episode 4- A New Hope (1977): Dir: George Lucas / Cast: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, David Prowse: George Lucas made box office history with this film about the battles waged beyond the stars to the outer limits of the galaxy. Young Luke Skywalker is given possession of two droids but discovers an urgent message recorded within one of them in the vision of Princess Leia seeking help from Obi Wan Kenobi. Unable to fight the evil Empire on his own, he urges Luke to join him. He tells him of his father's seduction into the dark side. Leia is held captive in the Death Star where Darth Vader uses her to locate the Rebel Base. Dazzling and overwhelming visual wonder from curious droids to strange creatures to massive spaceships. Imaginative screenplay by Lucas who previously tested the genre with THX 1138. Mark Hamill plays Luke as someone seeking his destiny. Carrie Fisher displays authority and vulnerability as Leia. Harrison Ford plays hot shot pilot Han Solo of the Millennium Falcon. He owes a large debt and sees this as great financial gain. Finally there is Alec Guinness as wise Obi Wan who will pass the torch to Luke but not before one last confrontation with Vader. Body builder David Prowse provides the size and intimidation for one of the most memorable villains in cinema history. Destiny is themed within this masterpiece of visual excitement.

This movie showed people a whole new potential that movies could actually have, by leading sci-fi into a direction never before seen. Movies after 1977 have never been the same, the vision of George Lucas was the start of it all This is with the result that pretty much every scene is iconic at this point. Movies are a subjective thing, and if star wars isn't your thing, then fair enough, but give this a watch before saying no to star wars. You can easily watch this without being a hardcore star wars fan, and still enjoy this movie alot!

732,"Star Wars is big and grand not just to scale but to it's three-dimensional characters, interesting story, and it's impact to culture on a whole. Everyone knows about Star Wars and it's memorable cast of characters, like the young Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill), the tough Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher), the scoundrel Han Solo(Harrison Ford), the wise old man Obi-Wan Kenobi(Alec Guinness), the hairy wookie Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew), the two droids C-3PO(Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2(Kenny Baker), and lastly, the best of them all, Darth Vader(David Prowse). With such a large cast, they are they hit or miss? They, obviously, are a hit and every one of them gives such a performance people will remember them decades later. This movie was so great, that it's seventh cannon film, The Force Awakens(2015), had quite a few elements from the original which translated well now as it did then. Though, there are some inconsistencies I've notice particularly with the acting. One example is with Princess Leia where one moment she'd have a British accent, then it changes to another accent. Also sometimes Luke can have laughably awkward acting moments, that can almost be considered on the level on what George Lucas did later on with Anakin in the prequels. And, from time to time their are some lines that you might not remember, or stick to you; they can be presented not that great. But for a majority of it, there are several quotable and memorable lines in this film, though even more is found in it's superior sequel: The Empire Strikes Back(1980). Overall, this film is timeless and will always be remembered and watched by it's incredibly strong fan base. I give this movie a: 9.2/10=9/10 overall",0.1714399092970522,0.4412925170068028

There was a quick cut between Luke and Leia swinging across the chasm in the Death Star and an extreme closeup of Darth Vader's face, from the cell interrogation scene.  Also, there were shots of stormtroopers falling into a pit.  I thought Vader was a giant and Luke and Leia were swinging away from him and the stormtroopers were fighting in some city and fell off a ledge.  Boy did I have a lot to learn!  Now, you must understand; this was the era of Sinbad films and Star Trek in syndication only.  The closest thing to sci-fi in the movies were films like The Land That Time Forgot.  2001 was shown when I was a baby and Silent Running was unknown to me.",0.03981481481481481,0.6592592592592592

And yet, everything seemed to have conspired AGAINST it - George Lucas had to make it using his own money; it didn't have a popular series to be the movie version of, such as The Lord of the Rings; it was made with some of the leading roles being played by virtually unknown actors - and yet, it succeeded wildly beyond anything that anyone could possibly have imagined. It spawned 5 other episodes as well as many novels and comic books, canon and not, plus hundreds of action figures and other paraphernalia. From nothing, its heroes took their place among cult icons like Sherlock Holmes and James Bond. Audiences enjoyed it in 1977 and they enjoy it today.",0.175,0.540625

Since it was made in 1977 the special effects to me still hold up to this day (The original effects not the remastered add on's that i think look ridiculous). The story is absolutely awesome everyone watching it is backing Luke and wanting everyone on the millennium falcon to triumph. One of the best parts of this film is the universe that it puts you in and the different species/people you get to meet along with all there separate stories. The only problem with the movie to me is some of the acting in the film, it really isn't the best it could be but with the places and scenes the characters are in, the acting isn't ever unbelievable or bad enough for you to loose interest in the characters.

Those old films were never given something as original as a lightsaber. George Lucas dosen't treat this anything more than it is, but at the same time, there is an underlying religious and mythic aspect to the film. Luke goes through the same transformation as Bilbo Baggins and other epic characters have gone through. He is reluctant to go on his mission at first, but through a series of events he is thrust into the center of action. He mets the guardian father-like figure in Ben Kenobi, the doubter in Han Solo, and the evil personified character in Darth Vader. In this particular film, he is whiney and naive, in the second film he is the learner, and in the third film he, finally becomes a hero and is a Jedi master. But I've already gotten too preachy.
