2888,"Star Wars is the best fictional universe ever created, and even when you're watching the prequels that galaxy far, far away is a place you never want to leave. JJ Abrams directs Episode VII The Force Awakens, which is set 30 years after Return of the Jedi and involves the characters of the original trilogy combined with some new, equally compelling leads. It's doubtful any film has ever had so much hype attached to it and TFA being a dud would have been... I don't even want to think about it. So, was it alright? The answer to that is it was far, far better than alright. TFA is fantastic. It's a wonderful escapist space opera rooted in nostalgia and crafted with emotion, care and art. This leaves the prequels in the dust (That's just putting it nicely) and, filled with epic space action, humour, compelling characters, science fiction wizardry and most importantly of all, heart, the force is stronger with this one than it was with Master Yoda. TFC is a thrilling tale of good vs. evil, a powerful drama, a love letter to Star Wars fans, but above all it's a thrilling, emotional, unbelievably satisfying journey like no other.",0.2410923753665689,0.6993401759530792
343,"I just thought this movie was so boring and would never watch again. Like 2 hours of pure and utter boredom. Don't waste your money in going to see this movie. The only positive thing in that movie was the little robot ball that rolled around the place making noises. Like how could someone find the inner strength to kill their own father is beyond me and travel to find Luke Skywalker and he doesn't even talk in the movie like come on! A dead rip off of the original movie, Episode 4. From the crappy looking infinity CG roll opening sequence, bar scene and light sabre fights to a janitor identifying a weakness in the battle star, this movie is chock full of inside jokes and tired ideas. The only redeeming grace for this movie is a solid performance by Harrison Ford as Han Solo and a compelling performance by Daisy Ridley as Rey who represents the resurrection of the Jedi. Fun to watch and full of action, but there are numerous dead spots and far too much nod to the Star Wars wonks of yesteryear.",0.07916233766233766,0.5584848484848485

It is definitely not the story continuation those of us who grew up watching the original trilogy in theaters were hoping for; the lack of George Lucas' input is very evident.

4122,"OK, so I was a Star Wars fan since I was a child as many of you are. There is NOTHING that will ever meet the expectations I have for Star Wars as nothing can hold me (now that I'm 36) with the same child- like innocence and awe that I held for the first trilogy. Many of us saw A New Hope as children and the droids, aliens, weapons, etc. were all new and really cool. Now, I'm older and none of that stuff impresses me like it did when I was a kid. Let's get real - the first time I saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the theater it was awesome as was TMNT II - totally thought Ninja Rap was cool because I was 11. I tried to show these movies to my kids - and was looked at with the subtle-yet-powerful disappointment that only a child can convey who looks at his dad rapping the song with Vanilla Ice.

The action was great, the movie was beautifully crafted and casted, Daisy Ridley gave an amazing performance as well as Jon Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Harrison Ford, and Adam Driver. Jon's and Oscar's characters have great chemistry just like Jon's and Daisy's which makes the characters relate able. The old cast is back and gives out great performances as well. As an old fan, the movie made me cry, pay deep attention, fall in love with it, and scream with joy.

The new dark force can not even kill a Jedi who doesn't even know she is a jedi. The girl is OK but really needs a better story line. Movi maker just jumps from scene to scene there is no time for us to get in the feeling of the characters or the planets where they are. Dead characters are replaced by other but have the same role.

The acting was spot on and everything was fluid. I also believe the cast did a beautiful job and the characters fit their roles and personalities well. I would also recommend watching the movie in 3D. This star wars movie was by far one of the greatest 3d experiences that I have ever had. Thankfully the trailers that were posted did not spoil any of the movie or ruin the whole plot line.

2549,"The 'Star Wars' film series is so engrained in our pop-culture, that even the rarest of movie fans have heard of it. There is no way in escaping from it! Several generations of people had gone through, at least one of the six films (1977-2005) in their lifetime. After all, the first 3 films (1977's Star Wars: A New Hope, 1980's Empire Strikes Back & 1983's Return of the Jedi) are often seen as the great examples what the ultimate cinema experience was meant to be. While, the chronologically recent 3 prequels releases (1999: Star Wars: Phantom Menace, 2002: Attack of the Clones & 2005: Revenge of the Sith) were somewhat mostly critically hatred. Can 2015's Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens fined a balance in the force? Can it live up to the hype and the high standard of movie goers, everywhere? The answer is a clear yes! Yes, it's better than the prequels, but no, it's not as good as the originals. What it is, however, is a promising start. The Force Awakens indeed awoken the long dormant Star Wars fan-boy in me. It's nearly a cinematic masterpiece with a few flaws. I wouldn't say, the movie is perfect. After all, The Force Awakens has the unenviable task of reintroducing audiences to a beloved cinematic universe isn't an easy task for anybody. Like the original 3 films, none of them were perfect. When you take off your nostalgia goggles, you will see the films for what they truly are, incredibly well-made, extremely fun, smarter-than-average blockbusters. Nothing more, nothing less, and after watching this film, you can put it in that level. I have to say that director JJ Abrams and his crew really did pull it off. With that said, the story is a mixed bag for me. It's a bit predictable. Set 32 years later, the events of Return of the Jedi, the galaxy's greatest hero, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has vanished. In his wake, a new threat arises, from the defeated Galactic Empire. Now call, The First Order; they attempts to rule the galaxy through power and fear. Only a rag-tag group of heroes can stop them. Can they stop the threat, while also try to rediscover the true reason, why their galaxy's greatest hero, sudden exile from society? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say, like JJ Abrams's last movie 2013's Star Trek: Into Darkness, the movie story is bit of a copy and paste rethread of familiar older films story beats with some differences in the way, in the, it's told. It can be a bit nagging with the 60 year timeline being call a myth, the movie being full of bad exposition spots, un-liking encounters with items and people, and it's lack of show don't tell moments, but for the most part, it does kinda work in establishing the connection from the new films to that of the old. They do somewhat work, together like emotional Han Solo (Harrison Ford) story arch. Make sure bring some tissue. Other moments, not so well. A good example is like how is there a Resistance movement, if the galaxy is once again, ruled by a Republic? Is the New Republic, some type of unseen villain that General Leia (Carrie Fisher) does not like? It doesn't make any lick of sense. The whole reason of conflict was a little awkward and a little unclear. One minute, they looking for maps for Luke, the next minute, it's about stopping a weapon from blowing up star systems. It's a bit flabby. Despite that, the original establishment cast were really great in their limited roles. It's really nice to see the characters back in the film, even the connection between them, wasn't well-established. However, I was disappointed by the lack of Luke Skywalker in the film. The new cast is just as good. Daisy Ridley as Rey, really was able to show the character's strong, capable, and courageous side, while also showing her weaknesses. She does match the role, very well. However, her character backstory wasn't really told, well. John Boyega's Finn was somewhat annoying, due to his mixed sense of morality, but for the most part, he works well in his means. For the most part, Adam Driver as the villain, Kylo Ren was alright, despite other critics might think of him. He show that he can easily be deeply conflicted, between doing what he feels is good and he feels he must do to keep the galaxy safe. From all of the new main characters, Poe Dameron is by far, the weakest. Oscar Isaac did well with the role, but I really didn't see much, character development within the film. In the supporting character side, I was somewhat disappointed with Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) & Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) with their limited time and acting. These are just a few nagging bits and pieces to them that hopefully will be further fleshed out in future installments, but for now, they are mostly likable and despicable as they are meant to be. They work well off each other and with the old cast, and have a lot of promise for their future growth. The action is well-paced in the film. Never a dull moment. It looks more brutal and realistic, than the previous films. However, the CGI squid alien attack wasn't really needed. Despite that, most of the visual effects were really stand out. I like how the studio preference for using real locations and miniature models over green-screens and computer-generated imagery. The film is more aesthetically, because of that. It does work. The film's score is by John Williams is just as amazing and enduring. Overall: Regardless, what I say in this review, and what critics say about this movie; everybody should see the newest Star Wars film. So find the force within you and check it out for yourself!",0.16535837700311384,0.45526499329130915

I loved this movie the moment I saw it and I still love it today, putting it right under 'The Empire Strikes Back' on my list of Star Wars movies in order from favorite to least favorite. I get that some people don't like the idea of a woman Jedi hero or a black stormtrooper turned hero or even a movie that uses nostalgia to tell our beloved story from A New Hope in a new way. But ya'll are idiots. This film was well made, well acted, and beautifully crafted from start to finish. While I appreciated the prequels when they came out, they were nothing compared to the originals.

One thing I particularly adored is how this new movie creativity uses  the Force.

Duel with Rey and Ren was the most realistic Light Saber fight ever. Really amazing cinematography. Good job. And so on... Everything seemed perfect and the movie started beautifully.

3795,"I just came from seeing STAR WARS VII! Before I get started, I'd just like to point out that I have never seen a movie with as much hype behind it in my life! Disney has really pulled out all the stops and spared no expense in stoking the flames of this release. With all the merchandising and third party tie in's from makeup to jewelry to breakfast cereal to (no lie) oranges, this movie is set up to possibly be the biggest movie of all time! As a matter of fact, it's so set itself up that if it's anything less than that some will look at it as a failure. Directed by Hollywood powerhouse J.J. Abrams, the director of the Star Trek reboot, this new Star Wars movie seeks to blow more wind into the sails of the biggest film franchise of all time and wash the taste of the ill fated prequels from the mouths of Star Wars fans everywhere. So what does that mean for you, John and Jane Q. Movie-goer? Well, it typically means one of two things, either it is in fact the greatest movie ever made or it's a rotten piece of garbage that the studio is hoping for big numbers for in the first few weeks before people realize that it stinks on ice. Well folks, I've just come from the theater and I have to say that without a doubt, Star Wars delivers! Just to give you a bit of a background, the last time we we heard about the saga going on in a galaxy far, far away, Luke Skywalker and the Rebel Alliance had just defeated Darth Vader the evil Emperor Palpatine. The story in Star Wars VII takes place some 25 years after the defeat of the Galactic Empire where out of the ashes of the now defunct empire a new evil has emerged in the form of The First Order, an oppressive force bent on destroying Luke Skywalker and his group of Jedi Knights who have since gone into hiding. At the same time a faction of the Rebel Alliance known as The Resistance seeks to find Luke and fight The First Order. This story is centered around The characters Rey and Finn, two misfits, played by relative Hollywood newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega and their journey to help The Resistance find Luke Skywalker at any cost. I'd love to tell more, but given the nature of this film, it's best to leave the details of the plot alone. Let's just say that they, along with Oscar Issac, who plays the hot shot X-Wing pilot Poe, do a great job of breathing some much needed new life into this franchise. At the same time, Domhnall Gleeson, Adam Driver and Andy Circus are famously evil as the quasi-Nazi First Order. This movie is not all new blood however, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and all your favorite Star Wars heroes like Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 make appearances here and they work well to provide balance between the old and the new in the film.",0.03617424242424242,0.4804022366522365

4020,"Disclaimer: The following review comes from a guy whose penchant is horror (mostly); I have never been a die-hard Star Wars fan; I think George Lucas has terrible, HUGE hairand his tendency to change what he deemed ""mistakes"" from Episodes IV-VI: stupidity—when he should have spent that time making the prequels something worthy of all the efforts put into them (or worth watching EVER). EVER. The fact that the many computers rendering all the unnecessary prequel CGI (& ""special edition"" versions of the original trilogy) that looked like crap did not stage a Terminator revolt proves that computers have no free will. That is another review, but this is all I will write of it. Moving on Many heads of frenetic fans exploded like a Death Star when Walt Disney Pictures bought Lucas out of his own franchise. What would become of the charm Episodes IV-VI embodied prior to 1997 & the violation of the force aka the prequels? Many hiss at J.J. Abrams' reboot of the Star Trek franchise, but I have considered the 2009 version rather enjoyable & Into Darkness an improvement. Still, his signature lens-flare-jump-zoom-please-the-audience-at-any-and-all-cost approach often sacrifices story & character. However, he is not an ignorant man. He seems to take criticism constructively, enhancing his abilities to new parsecs er-umm, I mean heights! Clearly a lifelong fan of the original trilogy, Abrams capitalized on Disney's $3 billion-dollar-purchase of Lucasfilm LTD by creating something that is and will likely always be to this generation what Episode IV was to those who came before us.",0.11192561778499277,0.5880614177489177
1300,"I saw the new Star Wars today. I'm probably going to be the odd ball here, but I'm not sure I liked it. The special effects and cinematography were bad ass, and the combat scenes were stellar (pun intended). But the plot was mostly rehashed, albeit with some new additions, like a turn coat imperial. There was also a tragic twist that I saw coming a mile away (and hoped I was going to be wrong but wasn't), that robs the story and saga of the lions share of it's personality. It reminds me of the new Star Trek 2, with the rehashing of the Wrath of Khan plot. I guess I would have liked to have seen some more originality in the new story rather than the same old plot, just done bigger. ",0.06032948532948533,0.5288981080647747

2077,"Star Wars The Force Awakens is a beautiful film. It's the Star Wars film that we've been waiting for for 30 years, the film that the prequels failed to deliver. It is full of gorgeous visuals, memorable characters, and genuinely funny lines but above all, it truly felt like how a Star Wars movie should feel. Wildly entertaining, at no point during the film did I feel removed from the action, or that I was waiting for the next scene to happen. The movie is very fast paced, with very few slow moments. That being said, the action flows together perfectly and somehow manages to never feel rushed. For me, by far the best part of The Force Awakens were the characters. And I don't mean Han, Luke, and Leia. While it was great to see the original three back in action, and Harrison Ford gave another brilliant performance as Han Solo, the ones that really stole the show were the new characters. The story centers around Rey, an independent, resourceful scavenger on the planet Jakku. Rey has clearly endured many hardships throughout her life and yet somehow, she remains hopeful about her future and maintains a strong optimistic attitude. As the movie progresses, we see Rey begin to discover her powers with the force and how to use them. But only towards the end of the film do we realize how powerful she truly is, and I am very excited to see what's in store for her in episodes 8 and 9. Part of what made Rey such a believable, effective character was the spectacular acting performance by Daisy Ridley. No other actor could have done a better job. The majority of the comic relief in this film comes from Finn, an ex storm trooper who encounters Rey in the desert after he crashes while trying to escape the First Order. It was fascinating to see a little inside the life of a storm trooper, something we never really saw in any of the previous films. Finn is equally as believable a character as Rey, and John Boyega's performance was spot on as well. Part of what made these two characters so great was the on screen chemistry between them, something that the prequels failed to deliver with Anakin and Padme.",0.2615606060606061,0.5343742424242425

The second item that this film does correctly is the editing, J.J. Abrams has managed to show other directors the perfect timing. The third item which I like about this film is the writing, because this helps with the pacing, although there are some plot conveniences but overall the writing is done to very good standard. Other thing that I like about this film is the acting, the performances are a very strong part of this film and the audience understands these characters and the actions that they commit on screen. The last thing that I like about this film is that the action sequences are done with brilliant timing and coordination. However like every film ever made there are problems with this film, my problems would be the audience doesn't understand why Kylo Ren hasn't completed his training because if he has been apart of the dark side as long as the narrative suggests, Snook should have completed his training with Kylo by that time his is seen on screen. Another item with this film is that the death scene with Han Solo, I don't have a problem that the character died but the death is quickly dealt with, and I personally think the death should have been extended. Overall this is film that a person should enjoy and I don't understand why people are getting upset about small things, I recommend this film to anyone.",0.23622574955908288,0.4149911816578484

The originals are so good that every time the creator George Lucas announces that he is going to make prequels or sequels to the originals, I say to myself, ""I've got a very bad feeling about this."" If George were Darth Vader, he would definitely say to me, ""I find your lack of faith disturbing"" and kill me. I was in fact not quite impressed with the prequel trilogy.

I was wrong and I am glad at being proved wrong. ""Be mindful of your thoughts. They will betray you."" J J Abrams has exorcised the excessive CGI demon from its possessed body and restored the original soul in it with a perfectly juxtaposed Yin and Yang. He has awakened the Force as Obi-Wan Kenobi predicted it, ""You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith and not join them. You were to bring balance to the Force, not leave it in the darkness."" It seems that Yoda's instructions were equally clear to Abrams, ""Do or do not. There is no try."" And so he did it.

2367,"Disney and JJ Abrams swing hard in their effort to repair the damage done by Episodes I-III, with mixed results. Spiritually it's dead-on, a loving tribute to the original trilogy that's a stylistic and thematic clone (with several not-so-subtly borrowed plot points) that makes for great fan service. Few cinematic properties have the rich, sprawling mythos of the Star Wars universe, and Episode VII is wise to draw from that at every turn. Those shared past experiences with familiar characters, settings and devices go a long way; without six films' worth of enhancement to help prop it up, this is just an average sci-fi picture. Wonderfully produced, with long, regular opportunities to appreciate the efforts of its all-world concept artists, somewhere the steep sense of scale was lost. It's a rather thin movie, all told, one that feels decidedly less sweeping and grandiose than its precursors. Less of a space opera than an interplanetary sonnet. The new cast members seem deep and interesting, so there's plenty of hope for future installments, but it's a little unsettling that Harrison Ford so thoroughly outshines them all. It's nice to see the rest of the old gang again, even if Carrie Fisher completely phones her performance in, but Ford is the film's heart and soul. Somewhere in the next installment, those new characters are going to need to step out of his shadow and carry things on their own. A promising step forward, teasing some intriguing potential directions for the rest of the new trilogy, but lacking a lot of the invariables that made A New Hope and Empire the timeless classics they remain today. Much better than the prequels, in any case.",0.135559866962306,0.4506936153277616
4940,"May contain spoilers Firstly, I thought it will be much-much worse Over 30+ years Star Wars filled its universe with enormous lore: books, games, comics, fan movies. And not all of them were just fanart, lots of stories were taken from not released official scripts too. Great stories, characters, plots ..and now Disney tells – ""f#%k you, this is no more Star Wars lore! Only we got true story"". I don't think what this is a wise decision... Now about the movie, cast and main characters: 1) Kylo Ren - why, god, why? When he took off the mask he looks worse, than Hayden Christensen did. He looks like Severus Snape's son. Strong and confident in mask, he became weak and stupid without it .Wow, how the hell trained Sith lord (or even if he is just an apprentice) got beaten by two people has not hold a lightsaber before? Why he not ripped them with force?? 2) Finn – okaay so now all billions of stormtroopers are gone (it is interesting – where they gone?  ), new troops got new outfit (small rebranding is very important in the time of war) and now are just people who were taken as children, to become killing machines. And in his first battle FN-2187 (Finn) suddenly somehow understand, that killing is bad and First Order is bad, blahblahblah. During all film he jumps from being frightened guy who want's to run far away, and reckless war machine 3) Rey – a girl from ""Tatooine-like garbage planet"", who suddenly understands how to use a force by herself.. She is kind and brave, but when it comes to Jedy thing the way how she manages everything by herself and it looks kinda far-fetched (yes, she might be Luke's daughted (???), but still).",0.10190438871473356,0.6678422152560084
3695,"After much discussion, we couldn't agree on whether this episode can stand alone. Since one can't un-know what one already knows, it poses a difficult question. I maintain that in order to enjoy this one fully, you have to have a knowledge of the story's history and the relationships between the characters. There are many references to the prior movies and I wonder if someone doesn't know: who Darth Vader is, who are the Jedi, what the force is, what the Death Star was, the relationship between Han and Leia, who Luke Skywalker is, if this movie would make any sense at all. MC is on the side that says you don't have to know any of those things to enjoy the movie. In any event, the new management of the franchise (Disney), has stayed true to the story, the style and the characters and pays all the homage that is rightfully due. The introduction of new characters Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) indicates the series is in very capable and likable hands. Although, with the exception of the aforementioned new characters, there is not a single thing that's new: story-wise, character-wise, action-wise or direction-wise. We've seen it all before. Perhaps they're waiting for the next two episodes for innovation and change. That said, it doesn't detract one iota from the entertainment value. It is well made, well acted and directed. The score was not as rousing as in the previous films and only hinted at here. The action sequences were the same as always. It didn't appear that there was any attempt to create an emotional response, a feeling of excitement, suspense or tension. Is it the best one yet? Not so sure. Also not so sure it lived up to all the hype and anticipation. Score: 8. Go. But I'm not going to force you. (Yeah, I had to.)",0.17998008658008657,0.43587647907647914

The whole plot line was literally a copy and paste of episode IV except far worse. Furthermore there was no character development for any one in the movie. Fans had to rely on previous attachments to characters like Han Solo and Princes Leia. Also can someone explain to me how Mark Hamill is part of the top billed cast when he was in one scene of the movie and didn't say a single line the whole time. Further more there was no value in any of the battles including the final battle due to the complete lack of build in any character or any elaboration on the dire straits. 3/4th's of the movie was exposition but Abrams decided to spend a total of ten seconds to hatch a complete full scale plan against the new order.

1683,"Did you already read the other one and two star reviews? Well. It's true, all of it. After the later Marvel movies, the Hobbit and even the Bourne Legacy I feared that the present Hollywood view on movie making would affect this new Star Wars movie too. The fear proved right. So what is this contemporary Hollywood view on movie making? Basically I would say that it targets an adolescent audience that get thrilled by spectacular visuals and explosions and that loves unbelievable superheroes. These two focuses make story lines, believable characters and human interaction of less importance. This we find back in The Force Awakens. There are plenty of explosions with a giant one in the end and there are superheroes that are unbelievably heroic. Teenagers will love it. Those having reached mental maturity however will surely miss character in the personages, human interaction and most of all a sensible story line. All this is missing in The Force Awakens. The first series was incredibly strong in the interaction of true characters and had a thrilling story line. In the second series the characters and interaction was less well developed but still had a thrilling story line. The Force Awakens has nothing of this. It is just pure flat violence with laser guns and flat charactered heroes. I dislike this Hollywood move towards making such movies so much I almost get desperate. But it's what the teens want and what Hollywood delivers them. Flat charactered superheroes that go violently 'bang bang boom boom' for an hour or two. I presuppose it will be a sort of video-game - movie crossover trend. First we got video-games that looked like movies and now we have movies that look like video-games. I don't know where this trend will take us, but I fear not where matured minds want to be. Details of this movie have been explicated enough. I just wanted to express my own disappointment about this movie. I lost my affinity with Star Wars. This is so sad. Ford, Fisher and Hamilton could have been legendary until long after they'll be gone.

3812,"I was just a bit too old when the first Star Wars films came out so wasn't a big fan and to be honest episode 4 , 5 and 6 just don't stand the test of time for me, anyhow to get ready for episode 7 I watched for the first time in nearly 10 years The Return of the Jedi earlier today in preparation for the Force Awakens. I could have nodded off to be honest if it wasn't for the occasional loud explosion. Unfortunately the same could be said for The Force Awakens too, OK the special effects are much better now than in the old days when they had muppets or puppets if you prefer ? but the expectations were very high for this new release , I mean JJ Abrams is bound to make this the best Star Wars ever right ? but alas not, this seemed more like a reboot than a sequel , the storyline was too similar and several scenes were very much a case of Deja Vu, was JJ Abrams trying to be too close to George Lucas's originals?. This film lacks the excitement and emotion that it should have, not once did I get goose bumps or have the hairs on the back of my neck stand up let alone any feelings of joy or sorrow and considering the effort that has gone in to making it this was a shame. I went for the 3D version and was impressed with the effects , although occasionally I did get some double vision where the contrast was high. I suppose most people born in the late 1960s remember seeing A new Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi and have a nostalgic recollection of these being like nothing they had seen before and unfortunately you just can't reproduce that even with the biggest budget ever. We have so many great Sci Fi fantasy films to compare to now that if it doesn't blow your socks off it's going to be a bit disappointing. OK it's not all bad, Harrison Ford is better than ever and delivers some great gags, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega put in really good performances as the new blood who hopefully go on to do better things maybe in episode 8 and 9 ?

I am sure some can relate, but needless to say once I found out Star Wars was coming out with another movie I got all nostalgic and excited in hopes of it capturing my inner child again. I am going to try and write this review as I do so many without giving any spoilers because in all honesty if you even remotely liked Star Wars at any point this is a movie worth seeing. I am not going to give you a synopsis or any character details, just the meat and potatoes as to what made this movie great for me. What I really enjoyed about this movie is that is had that old feeling that the original 3 had, but at the same time introducing you to a new story that I am hopeful will be explained over the next how ever many movies they make. A lot of reviews are giving crap that this is just a reboot of the first Star Wars filled with plot holes and what not. I saw it as something that grabbed pieces form the original that made it so great and recognizable while bringing forth a new story that would leave the viewer wanting more. You get new and old faces, and a plot that sprinkles in a lot of details from the original episodes. I mean they kept so true to all the details that even Chewbacca with old age had fur that looked like a mature dog that has some seen some crap, which I though was awesome. The visuals were unreal, and I found myself so many times with just a smile on my face when we were soaring along side x-wings and TIE fighters. Lets just put it this way, I went to see it with my girlfriend who only saw the original star wars, and bits of Episode one, and she left the theater enjoying it almost as much as me. It has a story that I think was made the way it was to also capture a new generation of star wars. The kid or adult that can watch it, enjoy it, and want to go back and watch all the original ones to really appreciate this work of art. Don't get me wrong there were times where I sat there and got a little bored, and questioned a couple of things, but it was not enough to have me sit here and say well this is a monumental disappointment. At the end of the day I loved it though, and highly recommend to go see it, especially in Imax 3D.

443,This film could have been so much more. Great films have great character development and evoke an emotional response other then boredom. The force awakens has very few high points. The only one that stands out for me is the few moments of tension excitement and interaction between Rey and Finn as they fight to learn to control the Millennium Falcon while trying to evade the TIE fighters on Jakku. This is the only interesting action scene in the film because it ties back to the nostalgia of the original and evokes emotion as the characters get to know one another in a tense situation. The rest of the film falls flat in my opinion. Poe the pilot who is supposed to be a cast member of substance seems like just another extra in the film. Same for the chrome trooper. The films story line is basically plagiarized from the the original star wars film. There is nothing wrong with creatively using certain elements of prior films that work well in your story but this is just a lazy ripoff. The film does have some creatively interesting concepts that could have been taken further. For example the starkiller base needing the sun to fire its weapon was creative and really could have been used to build tension. I was thinking while watching this they could have borrowed for example the concept used in the classic story of Dracula where the heroes are trying to get to Dracula before the sun goes down where he is most powerful. They could have built a lot of tension doing this and having our heroes fight a platoon of first order troops and Kylo. Could have had several of the non essential characters like Poe get badly hurt or killed trying to fight Ren to disable the shield thing. Could have had Solo die falling on a detonator and saving everyone (Bridge on River Kwai style. They could have had them dying trying to do this and have Ren kill them using his jedi powers. Point is they needed a climactic struggle that involved meaningful sacrifice and tension. This fell flat just having them plant a few bombs and have Solo just walk out alone and get killed by his petulant kid. These types of ideas have been done before but they are not blatant ripoffs like this film did. The character development in this movie was awful. The Finn character has one battle and defects. Sorry but they should have had him in a few battles and shown some kind of relationships with other troopers before having him just go off in the first few minutes of the film. In fact if they showed him having a friendship with chrome girl and then have him go awol making her have to chase him down it would have been better. The characters get very little back story so you really don't care about them. They make Finn and Poe like best buddies when they barely knew each other in the film. The film would have been better with one climactic action sequence and more character development. So many better ways to do this movie. Hell they could have made a chase movie where Kylo had to deliver something to the starkiller base in order for it to work. This would have built tension. They could have sought Luke out for help. I don't know any number of ideas are better then this bore. I cant figure out why these people are so bad at film making.

1563,"When my father took me to see the first ever Star Wars movie, screened at Odeon Cinema in early 80's, i was a kid. I was thrilled by the graphics of the movie, which was great even to this day, as it was a immeasurable experiential leap for me from watching the movie Weera Saradiel. Since then I watched all Star Wars movies as a youth and also with my son, Mev, through generations, and played every movie-game on PC and every generation of Playstation. Today with Mev again I watched the latest. Of course I enjoyed the visual perspectives to the fullest. But at the same time I was a bit disappointed as much as I was as a child that day after seeing the first movie. Star Wars civilization is yet to figure-out a better way of video surveillance, remote sensing, spotting and hunting down enemies. Their sophisticated worlds still depend on the capacity of dumb, individual, lowly-sensitive robotic soldiers to hunt down enemies from door to door, corridor to corridor, wood to wood, behind rocks and walls, behind bushes, like a bunch of stupid idiots jay-walking into ambushes. This wasn't any better than our great grandfathers' time when the British hunted down Weera Saradiel in thick jungles. Not even a single CCTV camera is found in a corner. As in most popular Hollywood movies, the kind-hearted, strong n' protective, supportive, Black guy dies before the movie ends, leaving the ""stronger"" protagonist white guy (gal in this movie) taking the fight over. The black guy is usually an honest subservient, less intelligent, humble, army-worker serving the best interest of the white guy/gal. There is no cool science, no technological advancement, no romance, no kisses. But politically correct to have had a dominant female protagonist, not playing a role merely as a sex object, which men often fall in love with. Though I expected at least Obama could make a change to the dominant American white culture to have a black guy kissing a white woman on Hollywood screen or fall in love with each other. It never happened. In general the movie has no big story-line, a plot, other than few random dog fights, sword/saber fights, fist fights and occasional acts of robotic cutie. No excitement, no sensual appeals, no comedy nor tragedy or emotions to take-home in general. Fighting goes from man-to-man, robot-to-man, ship-to-ship as of today giving the meaning of life to fighting wars in sandy brown dry deserts. No one can still hit a target with a single gun shot, but needs a shower of smart bombs/plasma sprayed allover to destroy one as of today -one random shot occasionally hits where it was intended. Dead are mostly bystanders. It looks like a low-budgeted movie overall with no depth -meaning that it's a failure. But money they pump into advertising wont let this Star Wars one such. For $60 bucks it wasn't a bad outing on a Boxing Day for me and Mev. Because the snack was great.",0.0386591478696742,0.42484335839598997

Jedi's are respected defenders of universe and being Jedi is not easy and requires a lot of training from younger age with a master teacher. also being Jedi never means that you will win against dark side. dark side won many times against unexperienced Jedi's. only by time and training you can face with a strong dark side. this new Jedi self discovered everything does not fit original story. it was like meaningless hero movies. she discovered everything with almost only 1 trial error. what a woman. maybe some feminist stuff turning around here. normally no man is given this easy and cheap way of being Jedi. Lightsaber is so dangerous to hold for a normal soldier. he can hurt himself. but int his movie that guy was fighting dark side even with no training. there is deep politics. this movie was too shallow. first of all if you destroy a dead planet from weak point, making another bigger death star (to be destroyed), is not smart, also it is easy copy of original story. Luke is sad or depressed and ran away. how come? so he left the dark side stronger. it doesn't fit any logical thinking. moreover he is a Jedi. last thing he can do is hiding. i haven't seen any development at characters.

3027,"When I was 15 years old, I read a review in the local paper for Star Wars. Well being a sci-fi reader, and a lover of adventure stories, I was intrigued. When I got to the theater that hot summer day and saw all of these other people in line to see the original Episode 4, I felt this amazing excitement running through the crowd. Like all of the others who were there for that moment in time, I will never forget it. No one had ever seen anything like it. There were no big stars, only the amazing reviews. And were taken to a Galaxy far...far away. A place where planets were like continents. All you needed was my favorite souped up girl, the Millennium Falcon, and my favorite pilot of all time, Han Solo. Rake, scoundrel, sexy, antihero, funny, brave, so lovable, and always up for a good fight. Yeah, I would have had his kid too Leia! Too bad he turned out to be a sociopath. I digress. I was very skeptical of this movie. There was SOOOOO much hype. But after my beloved Star Trek J.J. Abrams reboot, I just had to give this a chance. My son bought tickets for Christmas day. I don't know how we got in. Wow, I haven't seen these kind of crowds since Avatar. It was sharing a moment again with not only my generation, but also a whole new one. My son for one. It was the best Christmas present I've ever gotten. I have the first trilogy on DVD. My son and I are going to have a SW marathon and then go see the movie again. I don't know if he will understand why I left teary eyed. I have read other people saying that this is a remake, but it's not. J.J. gave us all the touchstones of our youth while making the way for the next generation. He re-established the wonderful mixture of comedy, tragedy, and on the edge of your seat action of the original. It's so refreshing to see a real fan make a real fan's movie for real fans. I didn't see it as a remake at all. It was just a new wheel within a wheel. Everything makes a circle. And I loved so much seeing it come around again.",0.26945676274944563,0.5770509977827051

His entrence in the movie should have been when the lightsaber was shaking in the snow. The lightsaber should have gone into luke's hand, what an entrence it would have been. Instead we only got to see him for a few seconds in the end, WTF!

496,"Here be spoilers... I was tempted to do my own video review for this one, but what's the point... this guy pretty much nails it. Not a bad action movie, but a pretty poor Star Wars film. Despite the locations, vehicles and costumes, I came away feeling like I hadn't seen a Star Wars movie. I love Star Wars and everything that Lucas added to create those worlds... but I'm the first to admit that Lucas is a poor ""actor's"" director... the result has always been weak dialogue that is unconvincingly delivered. At best, the first six films only had 2 or 3 scenes each where the cast managed to add emotional weight to the plot. I have no doubt that the actors had far less to do with that problem than the writing, direction and editing... Star Wars has always suffered from ""school play"" performances. In fact, the only 2 actors in first six movies who were cable of delivering their lines regularly with any level of credulity were Guinness and McDiarmid (in episode VI). I think that if you could speak candidly to any of the cast who had a decent acting career at the time, they might express a similar view. I suppose that was one of the biggest let downs for me. Having broken away from Lucas, I expected to see a lot more weight and credibility in the dialogue and performances. Unfortunately not the case. This inevitably leads to the viewer not being emotionally committed to the characters and therefore indifferent to their fates. I don't think this is an issue of genre. I believe that a movie's being fantasy/adventure does not negate good performances. The LOTRs movies are a reasonably good example. Snoke? Aside from the name having far too many possible similitudes that would lead to nothing but derision, why didn't they actually have the character be a giant? General Hux's ""N"" rally ranting and raving was presumably supposed to be reminiscent of a certain well known dictator, but ended up being plain laughable. The idea of a soldier who becomes repelled by the violence he witnesses is a good plot mover and a firm scaffolding for character development (although not particularly innovative) but here it was just not convincing and as such, entirely wasted. I think I expected a whole lot more from Abrams. And what's with killing the most renowned actor in the cast in the first 5 minutes? Von Sydow could have added some real colour. He had all of about two and a half minutes in the Wolfman, but it was one of the most memorable moments of the entire film. The locations suffered massively from the lack of Lucas and his team. Dull and repetitive. Where was the planet where people live in symbiosis with giant spiders who weave hanging nests in which the inhabitants live? Where was the dried up lava planet whose surface is now black obsidian except for the odd lava pool... where the inhabitants live in dug-out naturally formed mushroom-shaped-bubbles of that dried up lava? Those are just a couple of ideas I sketched out with my son 2 minutes after watching the movie... surely the new team could have done better? The one location that offered promise, the planet that was entirely covered in little islands was sorely underutilised. I did enjoy seeing the Falcon parked up in different environments. Some of the Death Stary/Star Destroyery interiors were pretty faithful. The movie also has some great 3D environment camera work. Chewie's been to the hairdresser too. Many people I have worked with share the opinion that the 2nd movie, in each of the prior trilogies is the best of the three. Maybe that's the aim here... to quite deliberately make the 1st somewhat lacklustre, so that the next will shine? This director is certainly no stranger to good writing and character direction... so let's hope for the best. All this said, it's still worth going to see on the big screen... especially if you have kids who are too young to be anchored to the 1st two trilogies.",0.13883675847961563,0.543721876414184

Abrams as director and producer was (up to now at least) 'Lost' - the captivating series which dominated the TV screens in the second half of the previous decade? A couple of things are obvious beyond any doubt. Abrams is a passionate of science-fiction, and he has Gargantuan ambitions as he tries to make his mark on many of the major brands of the genre (and some of its action spins) from the MI series, then in Star Trek ( with the 2013 Star Trek Into Darkness) and now with the film that starts the last series in the Star Wars trilogy of trilogies - Star Wars: The Force Awakens. He did not convince me yet on the big screen that he is the same original thrilling creator that made of 'Lost' the series that made people change their weekly schedules even in the era of Internet availability of everything, but he certainly succeeded commercially and this film is 'in danger' of becoming the best cash machine in the history of the movies industry, displacing another film which was not IMO a masterpiece either - James Cameron's 'Avatar'.",0.11902056277056278,0.46120129870129867

Poe Dameron was a kick ass fighter!! 2nd-I thought it was a very good film...yes there were parts that paid a homage to Episode IV but so what? 3rd-Its not a 10 but no way its below a five. 4th-Everyone needs to stop comparing movies. There will never be another Star Wars or anything like the original trilogy. So give that up. 5th and Last-You need to see the movie and not be thinking here is what I think should happen. Just go see it and relax and enjoy it. Before you know it, Part IX will be out and we will all be depressed",0.6264285714285716,0.6328571428571429
3196,"It was good, but I wasn't as thrilled as most people were. Visually, it was very well made and the action scenes were cool, but the pacing could've been faster. Star Wars is usually known for fast action scenes. The story was interesting and so were the twists. So it was a good time, nothing more.",0.3230769230769231,0.4153846153846154
4428,The look and feel is true to Star Wars...the characters are interesting and mystery surrounds what has happened since the Return of the Jedi. Great feeling leaving the theater after this movie. Hopeful for the remaining 2 films of this trilogy.,0.5499999999999999,0.6333333333333333
