It's fast paced, and crosses many planets at full speed. But it needs to. This is the final(ish) story of an inter-galactic war that's been raging for centuries. It's epic in scale and it portrays that well. As always the special effects are amazing.

It was interesting to see all these new force powers in the movie. I love how they utilized the force echo, which was used in The Fallen Order. I did have an issue with the final 15 minutes of the movie but the first 2 hours, it was epic, fun, no pointless missions like in The Last Jedi.

There wasn't nearly as many new ""weirdo"" non-human characters introduced as some of the prequels. The movie worked very hard to stay focused on central characters we already know and have become used to - so that was great. The dark theme surrounding the Emperor haunted the plot, which was fantastic and - without adding a spolier here, this 40-something reviewer was super-pleased when an old favorite returned. I wasn't expecting it, but I really appreciated that character being brought back into the fold. A really nice Christmas gift for Star Wars fans.

No. But it gives a good conclusion to the trilogy. Ben solo has the best arc out of anyone and is by far the best character in the trilogy. This movie shows that as well. The only problems I have is the name of the movie is misleading, and the beginning went by really fast. First thirty minutes was choppy but that's understandable because J.J. is trying to make up for the last Jedi. It's a good movie and every Star Wars fan would enjoy it.

3001,"I classify movies into two main categories. Fun and filmy. Fun being movies that are predominantly box office and are looking to entertain. Filmy being the movies that are taking the movies as an art form. Star Wars falls into the former. It's not meant to be anything extravagant, it's just meant to be fun.
This is my greatest frustration with big properties with a big fan base. There is so much critique over a movie that holds so much fan value. Having looked at the original trilogy, they are seriously no better than these. There is just to much expectation put into movies that are no more than a fun time. You can comment on plot holes, technical flaws, those are valid. But to claim it's bad through the lens of a fan wearing beer goggles for Star Wars creates this heavenly picture for a movie that will never be achieved. I have never expected a filmy experience from Star Wars because that is not the intention.
As for the actual movie I had fun. It was not the best and also not the worse. I felt it was worth my money and did what it was suppose to do as a box office movie and entertain. Competent on a technical basis and good all around acting but with shaky writing and plot points that left me chuckling. But I'm not mad, why?

He didn't manage to knit together anything more than a face-full of sticky and annoying spiders' webs). Then things got better. Slowly.

If you take out the fight scenes there's not much story left, and the little that is left you will have guessed early on in the film if not in the previous episode.

Maybe ""the rise of Skywalker"" is good enough to end this particular trilogy, I think it works better to end this trilogy. But not the whole saga because it already has an ending. This trilogy just doesn't fit well with the Skywalker story fans have come to known. If this trilogy was directed by George Lucas himself and the story happened right after ""return of the jedi"" it would have made more sense.

The actors did a great job and it is shown how they gained the love of the fans throughout the years but the characters feel a little down, like to much was added to them (rey), or their story arc weren't developed enough (finn). I am also disappointed about kylo ren's story, I feel it couldn't have been better if he stayed a villain and became more of a villain than he was before. I would have preferred to see that then bringing back palpatine to play the bad guy again, with not much explanation on how he is alive.

It fixed many issues from the last jedi, such as clarifying who rey's parents were, and how rey was so skilled (she trained hard, it turns out.

I don't have much to add that you can't find from other positive reviews on here, so instead I'll respond to a few of the more insane ones:
""Its made to pander to as many demographics as possible. Characters must be 25% white/25% asian/25% black, 50% women, all whites must be evil, etc.""
Um, I guess if all you were doing was tallying up what race/gender every character was, you probably didn't enjoy it. Since, you know, you weren't paying attention to the story. I have no idea how accurate his count is, because I was busy actually following the characters and the story, but since it doesn't really matter to anyone but angry racists /misogynists, it's pointless to speculate.
""Pulled Palpatine out of thin air after he died""
Um, he was tossed into a shaft. Sith and jedi have easily survived worse. And what other force user had the power to do the things snoke supposedly did? Many people speculated that snoke *was* Palpatine for that reason.
""rey has abilities no one else has ever had! Cheap""
Numerous jedi were capable of force healing. Using the force to sheath a lightsaber or halting the beam was something Palpatine had done before.

Not that I've The Rise of Skywalker I cand say that this trilogy is basically pointless.
It acomplishes nothing, absolutely nothing.
The final sotry of Rey was basically a rip-off of Luke's story (while simultaneously making Luke himself into a bitter miserable old hermit) and the whole point was stolen from Anakin. It was Anakin who defeated Palpatine and brought back balance to the Force. There was absolutely no need to retell this story.
Im not sure if it's all JJ Abrams' fault, but he isnt exactly known for inventing new stories... Its worth remembering that Star Trek Into Darkness was in large part a rip-off of The Wrath of Khan.
The saddest thing about all of this is that this project had potential. It had great actors playing interesting (as of TFA) chacarters, the story could be done into something truly great.

1267,"Director Abrams' closing chapter in the star wars saga gives a rousing send off to all characters involved, but unfortunately, this is a key stone cops style caper bumped up to A grade hollywood blockbuster polish. Some of the early scenes show great visual flair, and Abrams sure knows his way around large scale action sequences. But boredom soon start to creep in as all the action sequences look more or less the same. No degree of FX or production value can mask the wafer thin plot, which involves our heroes zooming around looking for one thingamajig after another. Star Wars mythology such as the return of the Sith lord Palpatine seem to be dropped into the story at random; there isn't a cohesive attempt at enhancing the star wars world building. We suddenly find out Palpatine is alive, there is a huge invasion under way, and if you've seen episodes 4 and 7, this is basically the same plot threads recycled, with the FX and action upgraded. Old characters mysteriously just show up for fan service for a scene or two. Everyone hugs at the end. Other than Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) , none of the other characters get much characterization beyond basic character beats (meaning - they all act teary, earnest and determined all the time). The Sith planet should have a certain terror to it, but it is just another impressive visual backdrop that seems less than integral to the world building. Technology of the universe seems selected at random and there is no effort to build up some logic (every bit of data transfer appears to need a serial port, guess they didn't invent WiFi , eh). However, ships can go at lightspeed and suddenly, every other destroyer has death star capabilities. Even with such supposedly terrifying weaponry, people just go around on horses blowing them up. In one cool but ludicrous scene, a ship just goes to light speed at random and pops up in the middle of all manner of floating space debris, planetary obstacles, and right in front of the gaping maw of a giant worm thing. It's almost like Abrams went ""logic be damned, I just want to make it look cool"". Kylo Ren is sometimes the villain, and other times a hero. The whole movie just seems arbitrary and made up by a panel of Disney marketeers. At least, the non human characters all do better than their human counterparts - it was fun to see C3PO and Chewie have their fair share of screen time.
The same action scenes from ep IV are all regurgitated, like Abrams had a fan check list. So expect planet hopping, return to tattooine, rescuing someone from a battleship, and so on. And one really wonders how the empire became such a superpower when the rebels have so many friends that can just appear in a minutes notice with enough firepower to destroy a large invasion ready battle fleet? I thought the Empire was crushed at the end of ep 6? Why are the rebels still rebels after 20 years. It would have been better if, say, the rebels had reformed the republic, but it was subverted from within by the first order. That probably would have made a better movie, but I guess Disney wasn't too interested in risking a new direction in the narrative.
As for a star wars universe point of view, there are so many important points that don't make sense. Aren't the Sith supposed to work in pairs? Who was Snoke? Was Kylo Ren a sith? Who turned him to the dark side? All of that just goes out the window, this trilogy doesn't stay true to the internal logic of the star wars universe. There is no build up to who the villains are, what their motivations are, everything is just kind of fuzzy - like a cartoon facsimile of the story we all know and grew up with.
I would say this is a terrible star wars movie which does nothing to continue the narrative of the saga but rather more intent on milking the first trilogy for all it's commercial potential - nostalgia is the overriding objective here, not storytelling. George Lucas, for all his perceived faults, at least wanted very clearly to tell distinctly separate stories. Eps 4-6 was a kind of western, while Eps 1-3, was a Greek tragedy in space. Sadly, Eps 7-9 is the glossy update of episode 4 (yes, it just concentrates on repeating a single episode) without any continuance of the saga, without any real character to the stories. Yes, they should have called it star wars episode 4.1.
In short, very disappointed. For the record, to me ep 3 Revenge of the Sith was the best ever SW movie.
Thanks Disney for spoiling the franchise. Great work. I'm giving this 5/10 stars due to the impressive FX work and production values. But this is a very disappointing end to the whole star wars saga.

5369,"Hi Simon and Mark,
I went to see The Rise Of Skywalker yesterday with my wife, 19 year old son and 13 year old autistic son. We are all massive Star Wars fans and were so excited that the movie had finally arrived. Are overall feelings were that it was about a 7/10 and very much a missed opportunity. They simply tried to cram far too much into one movie probably as they were committed to ending the series on the 9th episode. This meant that the film felt like a series of set pieces rather than a story unwinding. It also meant that many new entries into the Star Wars world just didn't have the time to settle into the film. i.e. D-0 and Zori Bliss, they just appear without any introduction and the director assumes we will just add them to the clan without complaining. The acrobatic jump that Rey does in the desert is far more thrilling in the trailer and the moment when C-3PO says goodbye to his friends is also much sadder in the trailer, work that one out. The incredibly dangerous journey across the skyscraper sized waves could and should have been far more exciting and thrilling but once again it was skipped over like it was a walk in the park... and the second time we don't even see it! I know this is a spoiler but the appearance of Solo IS by far the highlight of the film and it says everything about the stature and charisma of Harrison Ford that apart from Daisey Ridley and Adam Driver nobody else comes near for movie presence in this move although I have to admit Richard E. Grant is very good. The climatic ending just about saves the film mainly down to the performances of Ridley and Driver. The one huge negative was the same sex kiss mainly because it stood out like a sore thumb and took us all out of the moment like great big alarm bells announcing the obligatory politically correct moment! If it's set in an undefined time in the future why does it have to relate to Earth in 2019? Surely that's the point of Sci-fi isn't it? For eight movies the Star Wars universe has been securely anchored and now you tell me that lesbianism has just come into fashion? They could have saved it for the next franchise and left the nine intact but I suppose they couldn't help themselves. Shame.

213,"You know the bit in last jedi where Luke is a completely different character? which I would have been fine with if they had shown how he became that in a movie rather than told me about it, but it's easier to tell rather than show for hack writers to write, well this whole movie is summed is skipping character development and story. Its dummed up when Poe light speed jumps repeatedly in the Millennium Falcon to different locations because it looks cool. It skips any plot that makes sense creates more holes and ruins Gangster Palpatine he has pickled cloned Snokes in jars why? No idea let's pass it. It passes any showing of how these characters changed and what their purpose was in the first place, it someone retcons last jedi which is hilarious but shows how they are making up things as they go along, it has both to much exposition and then doesn't explain or show enough, Palpatines plan is stupid, even Rey's a murderer in this an overpowered Mary Sue God that left me dead inside. I'm sure the people who love this film haven't even seen or like the Original Trilogy because they did the same arc with Vader being saved by Luke but in this the morale and logic is idiotic and they ruin it in this film, if Luke murdered Vader then brought him back to life then he jumped away Return of the Jedi would have been worse. Your telling me this is what it's all been leading to 3 trilogies, Hux is a mole? What a joke that's like saying Tarkin was a mole in A New Hope absolutely ridiculous. People say it has memorable quotes, I don't remember hearing any apparently it's special effects are great it left me apathetic and it should be called A New Hopeless. The story is an embarrassment a sideshow joke and whenever some idiot says Star Wars is for children I say does Pepper Pig have decapitations? Does Postman Pat have planets destroyed by weapons of mass destruction killing 100s of millions of lifeforms? are people set on fire or burned into smoking skeletons in Frozen are children killed in Dumbo? So use your brain people don't be a zombie. This makes Spiderman 3 and Batman Vs Superman look restrained, smart, streamlined less bloated and make more sense.

Still, it was at the very essence, the least flawed of the prequels and certainly servicable, which is more than could be said about the likes of THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES.

I wont trash the movie for the various reasons that will glare out at long time fans. But since the goal was to reach all the younglings and appeal to new fans/market, the final 3 movies make perfect sense from that perspective.

If I wasn't such a big fan of the original three I'd have stopped watching after those three. They try to destoy the death star as they did in four films as if that wasn't enough. Now, they are trying to create a politically sensitive plot that uses people from all colors and creeds just to be PC. Why not keep to the fact that there are species from all over the galaxy with colors, creeds and ideals unique to each planet or area? This film is garbage. Trying to have a woman be sky walker. Fine, but aren't there already bad ass women in each galaxy without trying so hard to bring a human life form who's a woman into the series.

She's just some girl who has no skills outside her basic lightsaber skills. Plus there are no new villains or anyone that makes us want to care about her. She is a random character with allies who also no one cares about. STAR Wars has gone down hill since Empire and although Clones had some sweet scenes and a new plot, it too was lacking. Lucas and his producers are lazy at best and need new ideas to produce a back story that makes us care. It's a garbage film and I could care less about this girl. Why not have a sweeet protagonist, regardless of gender who progresses the plot? This is a trash film as were the last four. WE GET IT, they have a death star that you need to infiltrate in the same old way, and when that plot doesn't work, as it hasn't for some time, have a character who is unique and makes us care.

Unfortunately, many fans became needlessly upset with the most trivial and pointless things in ""The Last Jedi."" I don't think that that movie was perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but I think that the internet reaction to it was complete overkill. Due to the mixed fan reaction, Disney and Lucasfilm decided to go all-out in trying to appeal to all factions of this divided fanbase in the finale to their new trilogy. ""The Rise of Skywalker"" takes everything interesting that was set up in the previous two films, needlessly tosses it aside, and gives us a regurgitation of ""Return of the Jedi"" with elements from other ""Star Wars"" movies. It is completely over-the-top, nonsensical, and pretty much destroys any of the enjoyment that I had gotten out of this trilogy in the first place.

It's two movies in one, the first part being by far the best (I know others say the opposite), it does not have any sense, Palpatine is just there for some reason, the political situation in the galaxy makes no sense, so the movie is obviously idiotic.

Some elements without logic... It seemed like a bunch of movie pieces without coherence ... Like if the movie was made in a rush, without the care, without a good pace, without meaningful moments that better projected a storye where the characters closed their roles properly, either expected or unexpectedly. The first 2 movies of this trilogy, were better indeed for my taste.

There are things I liked, again the Kylo Ren arc is compelling, there was potential for so much more, but Adam Driver is such a great actor that Rise Of Skywalker comes to life whenever he's on screen, which unfortunately is not often enough. The first 30 minutes or so is Indiana Jones rip off territory as Finn,Poe and Rey look for a sith artifact and it's really dumb. Like really, really dumb. Again, this is what Cannon films Star Wars would look like. The redeeming quality here is that the movie works better as a schlocky action flick better then it does as Star Wars. So it's not boring and even has it's moments.

Jar Jar Abrams, on the other hand, fumbles this in the exact opposite way he fumbled TFA. In the Sequel trilogy opener, we watch him bore us half to death until a satisfying ending with a quality lightsaber fight and a villain who's intriguing family issues drive any interest in the trilogy. In this one, however, he delivers a simplistic (from a story writing angle) but nonetheless entertaining first 4 acts. The gang's little quest of shenanigans feels almost as close as Disney can use cash to conjure to the original magic. Jar Jar shows his lack of spine in the end, though, in his over-the-top self congratulatory botching of the finale. The character development halts before any satisfying conclusion, the relationships lose any meaning outside of their plot relevance, and the final showdown goes from bursting with potential to crumbling under the weight of the apathy it causes the viewer towards the entire Disney modus operandi.",0.135515873015873,0.5857142857142857
527,"Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) lives, and has sent a message to the galaxy threatening revenge with a huge fleet of planet-killing ships. The Resistance, and Rey (Daisy Ridley), must find the clues that will lead to his location and allow them to defeat him once again, despite the fury of Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).
For the third time in many adults' lifetimes, a conclusion of the Skywalker saga. Once again, a trilogy has built to this finale; once again, the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance. This one features no Sarlaac pit, nor is it as much of a step up from its predecessor as Revenge Of The Sith. But it does feel like a conclusion to the story that director JJ Abrams began in The Force Awakens, for better and sometimes for worse.
Although The Last Jedi split fan opinion, it unquestionably caused the biggest shake up in Star Wars lore since that revelation in The Empire Strikes Back. That opened up the story's universe to exciting new possibilities: to characters beyond the small Skywalker group and to injustices and shortcomings in the Resistance as well as the Empire. Yet Abrams almost entirely ignores the doors it opened and goes back to his first instinct, sticking close to elements established in The Force Awakens. So abandoned ideas like the Knights of Ren are back, and the conversation about Rey's parentage that Johnson seemed to lay to rest is reborn like the Emperor. Perhaps it should feel like a relief after Last Jedi's shocks, but instead the effect is to make this story feel like a step backwards at times rather than a great leap forward, and to make the whole trilogy feel disjointed instead of just one film in it.
Still, some elements are wonderful. Daisy Ridley's Rey is training now under Leia (Carrie Fisher) and has become more confident in her power, if not in her capacity to resist the Dark Side. She is still linked, bound even, to Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, and their clashes gives the film most of its best emotional scenes. Their strange connection has outlasted Snoke and grown stronger; they can duel no matter where they are in the galaxy, and taunt each other with visions of the future that support their own beliefs. And Ridley's terrific, tormented by the idea that it is her destiny to go to the Dark Side and afraid of her own power.
She and Kylo are therefore strangely well matched. Rey is passionately invested in her friendships and her cause; he is passionately cynical and suspicious of everyone. Rey is convinced by Finn that she doesn't have to do everything alone here; Kylo still has terrible impulse control and flits off after her instead of Supreme Lead-ing the First Order whenever possible. But don't worry, he leaves Domnhall Gleeson's Hux and Richard E. Grant's Allegiant General Pryde in charge, both sneering competitively and delightfully at, well, the entire universe but neither seeming entirely reliable.
The story more or less ends up in the right place, despite the threads left hanging.
Meanwhile Finn (John Boyega) now travels with Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Chewie (Jonas Suotamo) harvesting information from spies for Leia. Poe - in full Indiana Jones mode - is loads of fun here, though these capers bear little relation to his learning curve last time. Boyega is strangely underserved: he gets more screentime than before but less forward motion. While Finn's bond with Rey is repeatedly said to be important to both, they get no room to actually develop it. He's too busy being introduced to new rebel Jannah (Naomi Ackie), a charismatic actress without much to do. It might have been more economical storytelling to just let Finn shack up with Poe - or to give Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) more than a few lines. Keri Russell's Zorii Bliss is another interesting figure who's ultimately mostly there to flirt with Poe. Does he really need another love interest when he can generate heat with literally anyone? Alongside other newcomers like Babu Frik (Shirley Henderson) and droid D-0, and the glorious return of Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and others, there's a whole lot of distraction on our heroes' journey. Sometimes it's fan service, but too often it feels more like pandering.
That journey, too, is more complicated than normal. To defeat the Emperor, our heroes face a quest straight from high fantasy or average gaming: find the thing that points to the other thing to do the next thing, with a couple of bonus rescues along the way. The trail leads to the storm-battered remnants of the second Death Star, the ""Forbidden Desert of Pasaana"" and the snow-flecked world of Kijimi. The level of craft and design in these films remains extraordinary; visually they're all gorgeous, particularly the towering waves of that world in the Endor system.
As they search, destiny keeps calling. Rey and Kylo must face one another again; the Emperor must be defeated without the victor simply taking his place on the Sith Throne. And Emperor Palpatine is back, terribly changed but still potent, more machine now than man. Whether that is a good thing for Star Wars storytelling is less clear.
That's because, for all the visual panache, pleasing cameos and interesting newcomers here, for all that Ridley and Driver pour into their stand-offs, the Emperor's presence shows a disturbing lack of faith at the heart of Rise Of Skywalker. The fan backlash last time has been taken on-board too well; the storytelling here sputters whenever it approaches any similar chance to turn away from narrative convention and do something truly unexpected. You wish that this galaxy didn't feel so small and scared of stepping away from George Lucas' shadow.
Maybe it won't matter to fans. There are effective emotional punches before the end, as we say a final goodbye to Carrie Fisher and her generation of stars and as Kylo and Rey face their demons. Arguably the story more or less ends up in the right place, despite the threads left hanging. When it focuses on Rey and Kylo, this film usually works. Whatever the Dark Side says, we can make our own destiny, and we change the universe when we do.
It looks gorgeous and offers strong performances from Driver and Ridley in particular, but ultimately the saga ends with neither a bang nor a whimper but something inbetween.",0.15021729719555807,0.4858202522115565

Remember when Yoda kicked off with Doku in attack of the clones, or that wonderful scene in Rogue 1 when Vader storms the rebellion ship? Ever feel that excitement with any of her fight scenes? Nah me either. Why? Because her character was as dull as dishwater. I quote her feelings on the force.. ""It's a power that Jedi have that lets them control people and-make things float."" ... Deep, really deep. Make sure you say that in your head as flat as you possibly can to get the full ""Rey"" effect.

In terms of ideas there is just a surface that is nothing more than a tenuos collage that constanty collapses due to its brute forced buildup. Suddenly falling through sand to find a dagger that suddenly shows a way to a map, then a non-creative epic battle at the end - this is plot carrying at its worst.",0.0375,0.5275000000000001

1764,Amazing story! What a great work! THANK YOU for bringing us such epic story! Everything is so perfect and touching... I LOVE Leia and miss her so much❤ I'm so proud of Rey and Ben and I can't stop crying at the final scene! All the Jedi and the last Skywalker.,0.4068181818181818,0.665151515151515
3373,"The movie is far from being perfect, but the task of JJ was a absolute nightmare not to mention almost impossible after that mess of ""The Last Jedi"", so it's fair to say JJ did the possible to make episode IX work and it does most of the time, I know that the first 40 minutes are very convoluted and a little mess but what did you aspect after Rian Johnson stupid plot? The second act it's in my opinion very good and thrilling with some amazing cinematography and action sequences, not to mention the soundtrack just AMAZING like always. The third act it's ok, good in my opinion some elements will divide the fans but which movie since the prequels didn't divide the Fans? All in all it's a good farewell to the Skywalker Saga, I strongly believe this is the best movie of the Disney era the best of the sequel trilogy, I give it a 8 out of 10, but since we have some stupid haters giving this movie 1 only because, I give it a 10 to equalize the odds. PLEASE don't listen to them go and watch the movie decide for yourself you won't regret it, the movie is not perfect but as I said it's a good conclusion to the saga.",0.23029569892473123,0.6181720430107527

7417,"I wanted to love this movie more, i like it but it's damage control, bc of the 8th episode.
And tbh Rian had good ideas but he should have got a completely different star wars story. If JJ directs all the three episodes then i think it would be more consistent and i would care more about the characters and we would see a complet story. Spoilers:
I hated the fact that the title is Rise of Skywalker but almost nothing impactful was made by a Skywalker in the whole film...... This was about Rey. I cared more about Ben than Rey i wanted to see that a skywalker finishes the job and kills palpatine alone or with help of Rey. Or atleast the ghost of Anakin helps out Rey to finish Palpatine of but no we only get some voices...
I gave it a 7 bc i teared up 3 or 4 times but i was expecting to Anakin the chosen one to show up and somehow make an inpact. Apart from all that it's obvious that JJ had to jump in time so fast just to change up stuff if the 8th episod was made by him i think most of the fans would be much happiert right now.",0.2459821428571429,0.5303571428571429
572,"Just like he did it with the Star Trek franchise, JarJar Abrams came, saw and crapped all over the original spirit, mythology and feel of the original Star Wars (and by original I mean ep I to VI).
Basically he only used the brand, it could have been any new category B superhero action movie. With the references to Dune and Portal games, I'm honestly considering that he actually hates Star Wars and wanted to troll the fans.
Stat Wars never was a Scifi movie or strong on logic, but it mostly made sense within the confines it set up for itself (what can the force do, the dark side's strategies to take over or to flip heros to their side. Well, not in this one, let's break to rules of the Universe for the last two hours of the Saga for completely unnecessary twists, and make wild illogical happenings into a ""master plan"" thag was going on all along.
Oh, and by the way, the big answer on Rey's origin, well the timeline doesn't really fit or it would need a whole lot of explanation but there was basically none.",0.15178872053872056,0.5217803030303031
