1524,"Who would have thought that Star Wars, one of the most thrilling, dynamic series ever created, would become formulaic; well, it's happened. Around twenty years ago, Star Wars was a series with something for everyone: drama, action, romance; with themes encompassing love, friendship, and family. Now George Lucas is milking that reputation by revamping the original scripts. Not to spoil anything, but the film moves at the same pace as ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and has a disgustingly similar conclusion. This occurred with Episode I as well, but in addition the rewritten plot, Episode II features a weak script and poor acting. The obvious hole is generated by the absence of Liam Neeson, whose performance was exemplary in Episode I and whose acting skill seemed to inspire good performances from young stars Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman. Now Neeson-less, McGregor and Portman seem rather dry. Portman, whose career has interested me since ""Heat"", turns in her first big lemon. With respect to Portman, I blame this partially on her co-star Hayden Christensen, whose pseudo-sensitive/romantic approach to the role of Anakin Skywalker, comes off as a non-descript monotone with a complete lack of emotion and he seems to drain feeling from every scene. Luckily, the floundering leads have help. Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) steal every scene they're in, while the rest of the characters stagger around with poor lines and bad acting until the climactic battle. Whereas `The Empire Strikes Back' was thematically (though not ultimately) the best of the original trilogy, `Attack of the Clones' can hope nothing more than to span the gap between Episode I and III, and let us hope that this will be the low point of the series. 3 out of 10 stars.",0.09644607843137257,0.3985294117647059

Hayden Christiansen was a brilliant Anakin Skywalker, Ewan McGregor was great as usual and Yoda... well, see the movie yourself and giggle like a giddy school girl at Yoda.  Now, I am one of the few defenders of the Phantom Menace.  I think it was lighter than the other films because Lucas was trying to portray a much more peaceful time in the galaxy.  Yes, Jake ""Mannequin Skywalker"" Lloyd was not the greatest actor and yes, Jar Jar Binks brought out the dark side in us all.  But one thing I think happened was just what I said would happen. Phantom makes a lot more sense now!  Now we know that Jar Jar was there for a reason: (spoiler alert) To bring down the Republic!  The master plan of Darth Sidious is much more clear now, Anakin's path to the dark side has become more evident, and the birth of the Empire is imminent.  I think I can slip my Episode 1 dvd in now and breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that Lucas, the emperor himself, has everything mapped out and everything is going according to plan.  So I urge everyone to see Attack of the Clones and if you didn't like Phantom, go back and watch it again after seeing this great movie.

Meanwhile, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi travels across the galaxy where he discovers construction of a secret, unauthorized clone army. The story is much more intriguing and has much more depth than Episode One, but it too often drags and suffers from uninspired performances.

To start off with, it is even worse than the Phantom menace, the acting is appalling, the chemistry between Padme and Anakin is non-existent. Even Ewan McGregor (who is normally fantastic) gives a very sub-par performance. Granted, the original Star Wars trilogy didn't exactly have a stellar script, but at least you didn't cringe. Plus, the performances in the old ones (considering they are action films) is actually decent. The problem with these new films is the lack of a Han Solo or Chewbacca character (Jar Jar Binks doesn't count). Alas, people will watch it (or will have to) in order to understand the third one.

The acting is mediocre at best, grating against the cheesy script: for example, in a near death situation, Anakin states, as though it were the most serious thing in the world, ""I have a bad feeling about this."" The graphics are, of course, incredible, and the adrenaline rushes were worth the $5.75 entrance fee, and some of the scenery was fabulous, but if the movie had to stand on its own without being part of the Star Wars mania, it would be barely memorable at all.",0.1797619047619048,0.6273809523809524
3525,This movie is great and is full of action. It is great for a Star Wars buff and for just normal people. All of the boringness in The Phantom Menace opened up every thing.

581,"Yes, when the highlight of the film is an aged Christopher Lee battling a little green dude who really is not there the movie is just not a winner. Wisely, Lucas pulled back the usage of Jar Jar and replaced the young Anakin Skywalker with another actor. However, the movie is not much better than the last film and has way to many groan inducing scenes involving Anakin and Amidale who is now a senator as the planet she is from obviously has serious flaws in the way its government is structured. This one starts out with an assassination attempt on Amidale and great scenes like those Lucas ripped right out of the film ""The Fifth Element"" and had people selling death sticks (oh, what a clever jab at the tobacco trade). This film offers nothing new in the way of establishing a decent plot, other than the brief mention of the clone wars from the original Star Wars film. The guy they got to play Anakin was rather bad at his lines and was even stiffer than Ewan though I really think Ewan's main problem is that he did not want to really be in these films. We also get the origins of Bubba Fett as a guy who had less than ten minutes screen time in the original trilogy really needed a whole section of the movie dedicated to how he came about. Really this should show movie makers do not make scenes based on the fans wishes. Sure for some reason Bubba had his fans, but in the end his character was not important enough to merit this much attention. The only thing more stupid was making C-3PO a creation of Anakin even though he was a widely recognized protocol droid in the original series and adding Chewbacca for the heck of it in the final film in this rather badly written trilogy. There are scenes here and there that are good though (though not any scene where Anakin and Amidale are acting cutesy). Then Christopher Lee comes in and acts rings around everyone else and has the most entertaining fight in the movie as he takes on Yoda. So in the end, a rather sad attempt at trying to write a story around characters that were never really important to begin with and trying to set up a bit of Anakin's switch to the dark side.",0.0680526106546515,0.5051867067173188

3096,"Although i am not one of these fans who knows by heart every actor's performance in any of the five episodes already seen, i would like to add some comments. Too much use of the computer in the making of the film turns it into a semi video-game. The original three episodes were more authentic since they were filmed with less technical devices but the results were amazing. There are scenes in the attack of the clones in which you can easily realize how this or that creature is a virtual one and it is not very well mixed with the real environment. On  the other hand the actor who plays Anakin is a very bad one. Maybe he is too young or it was his first time. He is not very convincing in this role. The guy of the phantom menace was great at playing young Anakin. I loved The Phantom menace and i almost disliked episode ii. Even the love story between Amidala and Anakin does not make it better. In the story plot there is one point i consider quite original. The fact of making the audience understand that what takes Anakin to the dark side is his rebellion against Jedi's principles. But this rebellion is based on his love to his mother and Amidala. Does this mean that to be a good Jedi one  has to say no to life?. Are they priests? Who is in the dark side then?

That doesn't necessarily mean its a great film, let alone a good one. The film suffers from being too creatively controlled by George Lucas. The reason why Empire was good was that Lucas only wrote the script... And it had to be revised. It is his usual tension-free, bland dialogue script that gives the movie a minority of its problems. This was a classic example in the fool me once shame on him, fool me twice shame on me. The producers should have seen this coming and should not have given Lucas as much creative control as he did. Most of the plot devises he sets up crashes and burns. It is a catastrophe of epic proportions. The ""romance"" in this film between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman crumbles because of bland dialogue and implausible plot devises.

Tommy Wiseau could give better line delivery than that man. But no, The script isn't the downfall of the film, nor is the acting. The use of CGI in every scene, literally every scene is what killed the film for me. The effects added zero tension zero thrills and had zero purpose.

So, some of you get disappointed because you expect too much from just a movie (and from a director that is not specially brilliant). But think with me for a minute. This movies can't be written only for Star Wars fans. They are expensive and they must get to the masses. They must be worth seeing for us, original Star Wars fans, and for the new adolescents, kids and grown ups that didn't specially liked the first trilogy.

1894,"George Lucas returns to his roots and produces the second best Star Wars movie overall (after The Empire Strikes Back).  The action, adventure, sense of wonder and sense of humor which were noticeably absent from The Phantom Menace (except in parts) are all back with a vengeance.  Thankfully, Jar Jar Binks screen time is limited, though oddly enough his time on screen still managed to be so awkward and hackneyed that it made me wince.  By far, however, the biggest reason why AOTC cannot score higher than an 8 out 10 in this reviewer's mind is due to the idiotic dialogue between Amadala and Anakin during their love scenes.  The scripting in these parts is absolutely horrible to the point that my date and I were literally laughing out loud during the scenes.  In some movies if a scene doesn't go over right it can make you squirm or even feel a little embarrassed.  The dialogue and, consequently, the acting in these love scenes was so bad that all we could do was shake our heads and laugh.  From what we could tell, everyone else in the packed theater felt exactly the same way with several people giggling, shaking their heads, or simply resting their heads in their hands trying to hide their eyes.  Lucas is a genius at times when it comes to dreaming up these far away locales and the action scenes in this film are incredible and very impressive.  But he needs to face facts: the guy does not have even a simple grasp of what a love scene should sound like or how two people in love should talk to each other.  Granted, we're talking about a distant galaxy where customs and speech patterns could realistically be quite different than ours, but that isn't the problem.  The problem is that it is just CHEESEY.  Regardless of anything else, you have to be able to appeal to the audience of today...and people today, for the most part, aren't going to take that kind of crap seriously.  When Anakin says to Amadala, ""I don't like sand...it's course...and it gets everywhere.  It's not like you...you're everything that is soft - and smooth"" it was all I could do to keep myself from literally rolling out of my seat.  My girlfriend and I, along with the rest of the theater sat there slack-jawed that the dialogue was that cheesey.  Believe me, there is a reason I have gone off on this one point for so long: it dropped an otherwise ""almost perfect"" movie down a couple of big notches.  If Lucas had any humility and could recognize his weaknesses as a screen-writer he would have brought in some help to re-write those scenes and to try to form a real bond and romance between the two main characters.  It would have made an otherwise very good, very entertaining movie nearly perfect.",0.15090371368673258,0.49097634022162323

I think that Hayden Christensen acted really weak, even weaker than Jake Lloyd in the Phantom Menace. I would say that the light saber battles between Yoda and Count Dooku, and The Anakiin/Obi-Wan battle against the Count were decent enough.

Decently portrayed in The Empire Strikes Back as a wise teacher, the little green guy here is everything and everywhere at once. First he presides over the Jedi Council (ok, I think the whole council thing has been played out about a thousand times over in science fiction). Next we see him teaching Jedi nursery school, going so far as having his pupils greet Ewan MacGregor with ""Helll ohhhh Mass Terrrr Obeeeeee Wannnnn"" as pronounced in younglingspeak. Later on, he appears as a George Patton-like General in the heat of battle, uttering what will surely be the century's most ridiculous line: ""Around the survivors a perimeter create!!!"" erasing any remaining doubt of Lucas's incompetence in writing dialogue.

While it isn't as much of a mess as Episode 1 was, Episode 2 makes several missteps that are disappointing, but not offensive. The primary mistake is that Lucas got carried away with wanting more spectacle. He makes some beautiful shots. He knows how to frame things, how to make individual shots very memorable. And that's great, but the movie is packed with those, at the expense of making a movie that will stand up to repeated viewings without getting boring. The plot feels needlessly complex for a story that should be easy to summarize in a single paragraph. But each step of the story includes sequences that slather icing all over the cake that is Star Wars. Chasing Zam Wessel through Coruscant? Yes, it's technically impressive, but it feels pretty boring. It takes up too much time, cut with some very tacky dialogue, to get us to the nightclub.

For example, why the hell the bounty hunter trying to use some poison bugs to kill the senator, when he can actually put some bugs into her room without any trouble, why not just shoot her right there.  Also the special effect didn't get very good untill the second half,  the sky chase part of the movie is not original, merely a shamelessly copy of Fifth Element which was made 6 years earlier, and still looked a lot better than this movie.  The only good thing I can say about this movie is the special effect at the end, yes it is very good.  But for some reason, I am not that impressed.  I think I expected Star War to be this good.

3167,"I see mostly bad reviews for this latest installment of Star Wars, and I wonder, why? First, I say read the book. I have never seen a movie that was better then the book. The book would probably make much more sense to people than the movie, and eliminate many of these stupid postings from people who can't think. Most of the negative reviews talk about the story not making sense, being too complicated, or too dull. I ask how can this be complicated for anyone over the age of three? Naturally, what follows is my interpretation of events and may not be entirely accurate. Ten years before, around the time of The Phantom Menace Palpatine/Darth Sidious arranged for the creation of the clone army. I know they mention Sifo-Dyas as arranging it, but that could be Sidious/Palpatine or Dooku/Tyranus. The Dark Side of the force kept Yoda and Mace Windu from knowing of its creation, implying a connection. In addition, Jango Fett says `a man called Tyranus' (Count Dooku) recruited him. After the clone army was in creation Palpatine arranged the Separatist movement to create need for the army. The need for the army led to the senate's decision to give Palpatine extra powers. Powers which he claims he'll `lay down when this crises has abated.' This puts him in the position to name himself emperor, which he will probably do in Episode III as the empire is already in place in IV. Many people say at least this was better than Episode I, but I don't think Episode I was as bad as people say. In fact, and right after I say this many people will no doubt think I'm an idiot and stop reading immediately, I think Episode I was better then the first three, but not as good as II. The reason I have for this is IV, V, and VI have an unfinished feel about them. There is almost no mention of anything that happens in the first three aside from one reference to the clone wars, the one mention of Luke and Leia's mother and a few mentions of their father and is turn to the Dark Side. They just seem more complete. Naturally, there couldn't be mentions because they didn't exist yet, but you should get what I'm saying. Episode I sets the stage. For anyone who wasn't and isn't bright enough to understand, the major event in Episode I was the electing of Palpatine to Supreme Chancellor. Never mind the Trade Federation's defeat at Naboo or Jar Jar Binks (Side note: listening to everyone talk how annoying he is and how much they hate him and want to kill him is worse then Jar Jar himself) the main thing was Palpatine. Ah, now to the romance or lack thereof between Anakin and Amidala. Again, I say read the book. From the book to the movie about three-fourths of the scenes with them were cut out, making it seem like she was with him 5 minutes then started to love him. They removed when they have dinner with her family, and she admits to her sister Sola that she is starting to fall for him. A minor thing I only saw once or twice was someone saying Anakin was basically good-hearted and that they couldn't see how he would turn into Darth Vader. I ask, did you even see the part where he slaughters all the Tuskin Raiders? He lost control and let his hate rule. He killed the women and children. That's pretty bad. This is another guess of mine but I think it is pretty fair. What if he lost the person he loves? Now we know that Amidala has Luke and Leia and even that she had to live for a while after having them because in VI Leia recalled her mother as being beautiful but always sad. Now, Anakin/Vader didn't know of his kids, showing he was not with her when she had them, probably because he was Vader, and Anakin no longer. The question, what would turn him to the Dark Side? My guess is he believes Amidala was killed, then in his anger turns to the Dark Side, with help from Palpatine of course. Once he has turned, Amidala goes into hiding because there's nothing she can do to turn him back, has the kids then is killed somehow. After all, I really can't see how someone could turn to the Dark Side if the person they love is right beside them.",0.013688256188256202,0.5142612942612942

1059,"Attack of the Clones had the unenviable distinction of being not so much the prequel to Star Wars but the sequel to the Phantom Menace. If movies were people this would be like finding out you were Hitler's nephew or worse, Charlton Heston's son. Menace achieved a lot, namely what many thought impossible; permanently sapping the lustre from what was an almost universally adored series. If the sparkle was to return to those stars this had to first class, grade A, top of the class stuff. Any reminder of its predecessor beyond the bare bones of plot continuity were therefore wise to avoid at all costs. Clones partially succeeds in restoring some pride to the series. Structually its better than its predecessor, the plot more straightforward and less marred by political spiel than before. However, this can't hide its wider failings. Just as before, none of the newer characters fail to make any impact. There's no Han Solo or Luke to offer us the simple pleasures of before. Padme no longer speaks with a lifeless monotone and could almost pass for a real human being. Binks, reviled by the entire universe has a greatly reduced role. Lucas puts two fingers up at those who maligned his 'comic' creation, i.e. everyone and ensures Jar Jar is central to a key plot point thus justifying his existence in the series. He'll claim it was planned that way all along of course but you don't need to be a Jedi to work out this is the cine-equivalent of the spoilt child who has to have the last word in an argument. It was still WRONG George, I don't care if the Gungan menace killed the Emperor himself. The central flaw in Clones is the relationship that should be its (and the series) emotional core, namely the relationship between Anakin and Padme. From the outset this is doomed on screen because of the casting of Hayden Christensen. His performance is so wooden and devoid of credibility that you might as well have hired the Gaffer's son and got him to read out the lines. We're asked to believe that this dull and stroppy teen will one day be the most feared man in the universe. So why does Padme fall in love with the little upstart? Lucas's script offers no clues. Anakin's diatribe on the failings of democracy should be enough to alarm any potential suteur but Padmes hardly bats an eyelid. She gets a another chance later after Anakin slaughters an entire tribe of Tusken Raiders but do any bulbs go off? Not a bit of it. Having proclaimed his murder of women and children the feckless former Monarch gives him a supportive hug! The problems of being attracted to a would-be fascist and murderer are offset, Lucas suggests, by the fact that Skywalker is good at rolling around in grass and making fruit float in the air, thus showcasing his playful qualities. We're left concluding that the most important couple in the galaxy came together because Padme is a sucker for a pretty face. Cynics may point to some evidence of misogyny here but in Lucas' defence this is the man who championed the role of women by putting Princess Leia in that slave girl two-piece. In any event Padme deserves everything she gets. Does the rest of the story fare any better? Sadly not. Obi Wan's journey to Kimino to visit a clone factory pushes story credibility to the limit. No one seems very alarmed by the prospect of entire army having being created in secret. Why should they you ask, the Jedi are in charge right? Wrong. Having being captured by Count Dooku the hapless Jedi is TOLD that Palpatine is the Emperor but dismisses it as dark side deception. Does no one think to check it out? Of course not and consequently only Yoda shows any common sense, only neglecting to mention his kidnap and replacement by a terrible puppet around the time of Menace. We're also treated to some moments of unintentional hilarity. Titter ye not at the Anakin blow job scene, and if you're watching toward the end try not to laugh when Yoda fights Dooku which looks like the Sith lord is trying to swat a giant fly. In contrast all the real jokes fail flat mostly, C3P0 the worst offender with some truly awful sub-Graham Norton punning that will make you wish you could disconnect your own head. Only Ewan McGregor in a more relaxed performance gets a good bit of deadpanning in with his caustic ""to get a drink"" response to Anakin's ""where are you going?"" question. So the romance is rushed and insubstantial - laced with some of the worst dialogue you'll hear in any language (""A litter piece of me dies each day"", yuk), and the Clone story fails to ignite due to lapses in plot logic and some flat delivery by the leads. On the plus side there are some nice set-pieces, though a little too cartoony is places, and a few crowd pleasing moments. All in all this is a better than before but not yet near the level set by the original trilogy. With only one film left to go there is a hell of a lot to be done (as well as a hell of lot of plot to get through) if this trilogy is to save face. Despite some attempts to improve, this is still the longest expositionary picture ever made. Skip it and watch the 2 minute scene in the original describing this period instead. Its over sooner and tells you all you need to know, namely very little.",0.040937336473050756,0.5211669283097853

2344,"When you read the other reviewers of AOTC saying that George Lucas has redeemed himself after the much slated Phantom Menace, they are absolutely right. I was never one to negatovely criticise Episode 1 but I have to admit that it had lacked the essential Star Wars feel of the later episodes. This, I thought was down to the fact that I have aged 25 years since the original Star Wars and even though I attempted to view it with some of that childhood wonder, I felt perhaps that something was lacking. Any preconcpetions I may have had prior to seeing AOTC quickly disppeared though and I add my vote to the many who say that George Lucas has definitely returned to form. Attack of the Clones is, quite simply, stunning. Mainly due to the incredible effects but also due to the fact that Lucas seems to have returned to his grass roots. Perhaps, he tried too hard with Phantom, attempting to create something that would satisfy the fans' 25 year old hunger. An impossible task but here, he has settled back down into what he does best: simple storytelling. For a start, AOTC ""feels"" like proper Star Wars. In episodes 4,5 and 6, there were a number of story threads throughout each film which met to a conclusion at the end. Phantom Menace didn't seem to pull this off and followed the same characters from the film's start to its finish. In AOTC, there a number of different stories going on: Obi Wan's quest for the truth behind Senator Amidala's attempted assassination, the conspiracies happening behind the scenes in the Galactic Republic, the love story between Anakin and Padme, and Anakin's struggle with his own feelings and his role as a Jedi. This made it a much easier film to digest as each story was broken down into small pieces and alternated throughout before meeting for the conclusion. Hayden Christensen did a surprisingly good job of the maturing Anakin and although it took him a good while to achieve empathy to his character, once comfortable with his his role one could really get into the head of soon-to-be Darth Vadar. His feelings for his mother, he's uncontrollable love for Padme and his rebelliousness in the Jedi Order.  One of the most frightening scenes had him slaughtering Sandpeople, his rage uncontrolled and vicious. If Lucas maintains the passion of this character then we are in for one hell of an Episode 3 as we find out his fate. Ewen McGregor seems completely comfortable with his role as Obi Wan and looks and acts more like Alec Guinness with each passing scene. I also loved the many references to the later films, especially meeting a young Owen Lars and his girlfriend Beru. What a joy to see Luke Skywalker's future home, with Anakin sat in the refectory where we met a disillusioned Luke many years ago! And what about the young Boba Fett? Now we finally find out why he hates the Jedi so much. The young lad who plays him carries off the look of revenge so well as he realises his life-long vendetta. Watch out too towards the end of the film, a hologram of the Separatists' new weapon off-camera ... the Death Star. And did you ever want to see what Yoda really could do? Oh my god! His fight scene with Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) was a genius piece of work. The audience roared with laughter too when after putting his light sabre away, he hobbled away as normal on his walking stick! The effects are quite simply stunning. Lucas, comfortable with his art has created a universe of unparalelled beauty. We get to see more of Coruscant (watch out for the deliberate reference to Blade Runner), Naboo, Tattooine and new worlds such as Kamino and Geonosis. One of the most stunning scenes is the quite simply amazing chase sequence through the asteroids of Geonosis. Remember how impressed you were with Han Solo guiding the Millennium Falcon through asteroids after its flight from Hoth? You ain't seen nothing yet! And I was overjoyed to see one of my favourite Star Wars vehicles, The Slave I, doing its stuff. The final battle sequence too, with a million Clone Troopers fighting battle droids is perhaps one of the greatest sequences ever filmed. Attack of the Clones from my perspective as a Star Wars fan, more than excceeded my expectations and I know that I need to see it at least twice more. This is REAL Star Wars, overdosed on steriods and the best two and half hours I have spent this year. If you're a fellow fan, you'll love it and I would even say that to those who claim Empire is the best of the lot ... there's a new guy in town.

The final battle is well filmed and visualized, and best of all feels necessary and not forced. The weakness in this movie, ironically is the main character; Anakin Skywalker. At times, you would find yourself rooting against him, which is a big flaw in any movie. Anakin's dialogue and Hayden's acting abilities make it seem like a fan movie could achieve better.

It is a sweeping epic that will excite and entertain anyone who isn't brain dead or a professional movie critic (which often goes hand in hand, at least in the US). I've been to two showings and on both occasions the audience was clearly moved and everybody cheered throughout the movie. There was a huge roar of applause from people of all ages after the movie ended.  Some have criticized the acting but in my opinion that is absolutely ludicrous and has probably more to do with the fact that most of the actors are not from the USA than their talent. Hayden IS Anakin Skywalker just as Harrison Ford was Han Solo and its impossible to imagine anyone else taking their place. Ewan and Natalie play their roles well and Samuel Jackson and Christopher Lee are brilliant. I fear many of the critics that have given this movie a negative review have alternate motifs.

925,"I've not seen the first movie of these series therefore I cannot compare. This movie has got all the qualities and faults that usually are shown by this kind of movies. On the positive side we can name action, movement, marvellous images and a clockwork precision in the image cut. On the negative side there is always the poorness of the story and the message. Lucas is really however a great master of this kind of movies from the technical point of view, maybe the greatest one. The movie theme is the endless fight of good and evil expressing itself here in well built scenes of battles or individual duels of great strength and movement. This kind of movies for lack of imagination of what can be a different world in terms of towns, buildings, clothes, weapons and general behaviour, often recreate past centuries images with frequent reference to the Middle Age or even the antiquity. In this particular movie we have even the recreation of some kind of Roman Circus fighting with a lot of adaptation (lions replaced by monsters etc). One last word to characterize what in my opinion is a good sci-fi novel or movie. Not that one where Cowboys and Indians (or nazis and democratic armies) are replaced by people with futurist clothes and weapons but fighting for the same values as we know them today but a story where we are faced with fictional different values, a different social and social structure i. e. a really different world being the work of the author's creative mind. This movie is very far from such a definition.",0.17404461279461275,0.5065867003367003

I thought it was alot better than ""the phantom menace"" it was full of action and new and awesome scenes, that were nothing like any in the other StarWars flicks.

1580,"I have read through many of the  previous comments on this movie and I just dont get it. It is a movie based on a book. BASED on a book,  not an absolute rendering of history of a time that actually existed. Even Stephen King occasionally alters his storys from the book to the screen play. As for ""Anakin's"" acting....go back and view the first Star Wars movie Mark Hammil stared in,he isn't exactly Oscar material, Sorry Mark. (I have seen some recent work he has done and he is quite improved.) And if you view the final movie of the original three the whole thing is saved with the assistance of a bunch of furry creatures called Ewoks.",0.08525641025641026,0.44423076923076926

1325,"I don't understand why this movie is liked. There are likable things about it, granted not many. With that in mind I guess I can mention what was a pro in my mind about this movie. As always the music is really good. The other thing I thought could have worked was the plot and idea of the clone army/wars. The clone wars are a really cool and interesting topic and showing how they began would have really gripped me if this movie was just executed better. The movie is more gripping and interesting that episode 1, but not by a lot. The performances were decent, with the stand out being ewan mcgregor, who really stepped up and improved massively from episode one. The special effects are ok, but nothing amazing. The dialogue is where this film really lacks though. I feel like George Lucas has an amazing imagination and can come up with these worlds and ideas for stories but when it comes time to sit down and write the story he struggles, and this problem is only evident in the first 2 episode of Star Wars. Following the basic premise of a clone army popping up out of know where to fight for the Jedi against a droid army controlled by an intriguing evil Sith Lord is interesting. But when you dove deeper to how George Lucas wrote this story, it hurts because this movie could have been so much more. Overall episode 2 was a big let down considering how much missed potential there was.",0.22250566893424037,0.5042630385487529
