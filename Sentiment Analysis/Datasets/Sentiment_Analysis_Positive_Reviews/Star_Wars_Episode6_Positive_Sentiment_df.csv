266,While this is probably the weakest of the original trilogy it is still an enjoyable film with all the thrills we'd come to expect in the series and it provides a good conclusion to the saga.,0.525,0.65
414,"I'm not one of those critics of ROTJ who hates the movie, but I do think it's quite obvious that when you watch the three movies together it's clear that the entire storyline that was established so wonderfully in Star Wars, is just coasting to a finish here instead of soaring to a powerful climax.",0.28,0.7016666666666667
693,"* Spoilers * 'Empire' may be the best of the three movies in the original Star Wars trilogy artistically, but ROTJ, in my mind, is and always was unsurpassed by the other two movies in terms of action and sheer scale. There's just so much happening in this movie as Lucas tries to wrap up the trilogy; there's the rescue of Han and ensuing capture and escape from Tatooine, then the resumption and conclusion of Luke's training, the planning for the assault on the second Death Star, the landing of the infiltration party on Endor, and finally the interleaved 3-way finale between the battle on the surface of Endor, the battle in space, and the final confrontation between Luke, Vader, and the Emperor. I think one of the main reasons this film is so overlooked in the trilogy is simply because of the Ewoks, which is a shame. That, in my mind, is something that can be overlooked. Yes, they are corny in some scenes, but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it. And the ending is a very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy - more so than most other sci-fi trilogies these days seem to be able to manage (i.e. Terminator, the Matrix). Who can forget that scene, with Darth Vader dying in Luke's arms...""you were right about me Luke...you were right..."" It's just brilliant, and at the same time, a sad ending to a great epic story of finding one's purpose, not giving up, redemption, and the ultimate triumph of humanity and love over evil. Too bad Lucas hasn't been able to recreate the magic in the new trilogy, though (mainly because the characters suck, in my opinion). ROTJ gets a 9/10 in my book.",0.1853371376098649,0.5785287944378853
552,"It is never easy being openly critical of a Star Wars movie. So many people first saw them when they were very young which creates a do no wrong attitude.

104,"""Star Wars"" brought together elements from various works of art to create an eye-catching, distinctive, and fairly original film which took the world by storm. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" fleshed out the characters, gave us some absolutely terrific action scenes and beyond all that consisted largely of really, really great scenes and moments. ""Return of the Jedi"" was at a disadvantage in following ""The Empire Strikes Back"", not only a great piece of genre fiction, but a genuinely lasting work of art, and one which promised an incredible finale at that.",0.24791666666666667,0.48750000000000004
640,"This was everyone's favorite as a kid but for me I never clicked with this film until I was older. ROTJ had always been a mixed bag for me up till recent years where I actually paid attention to the deeper story at hand. The storyline between Luke and Vader is so profound and so powerful that it's conclusion will stand to the rest of time. The low points in this film for me is everything surrounding that plot line. Jabba's Palace is way too long, almost like a short film as the beginning of this film. The Ewoks subplot slows the pacing of the movie but the space battle is highly entertaining.
Overall, this is no 'Empire Strikes Back' nor 'A New Hope', it is a great solid conclusion even if it can be messy throughout.",0.13155080213903744,0.43163992869875223

62,"The third of the original trilogy of Star Wars warps up the story beautifully. George Lucas would write and produce two more trilogies - in a prequel and then sequel series. But this first series contains a whole story in itself. The next two trilogies are good, and sci-fi fans should enjoy them.

635,"""Return of the Jedi"" is widely considered the weakest of the Original ""Star Wars"" Trilogy, and I agree. ""Jedi"" lacks the breakneck pace and narrative focus of the first two, and its famous climax is essentially a less interesting remake of the Death Star sequence from ""A New Hope."" But despite its flaws, ""Return of the JedI"" is still a fun space opera with some of the best moments in the entire ""Star Wars"" saga.",0.279469696969697,0.4629545454545455
114,"Yes, there are ewoks in it: yes, the plot threads from the previous episodes are left dangling at the start of the movie. Yet the confrontation between Luke Skywalker and the emperor AMAZINGLY portrayed by Ian McDiarmid as well as Vader's redemption are simply superb and out of question, with the most touching moments of the entire saga all depicted here. Especially the final scenes with Vader's funeral is, hands down, the best scene of all Star Wars ever, something you simply can't stop crying about even after watching it for the tenth time.

207,"Three years after the release of the excellent ""The Empire Strikes Back"", George Lucas returns to end his first epic trilogy. At that time several products were created with the characters of the saga were created to satisfy fans in the four corners of the planet. This time he returns as an executive producer and scripts the film alongside Lawrence Kasdan, who had already written the previous film in the series and who also had in his curriculum between the two films, the great Corpos Ardentes (1981) in which he wrote and he directed, in addition to the timeless adventure classic The Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) by Steven Spielberg, which he scripted. For direction, Lucas again decided to cast another director to lead the final part of his series. Having directed only short films and TV series and having the only most relevant feature the good O Buraco da Agulha (1981), Richard Marquand is the one who takes on the responsibility of closing the initial trilogy with a flourish.

245,"As Mel Brooks proclaimed in ""Spaceballs"": it's ""the search for more money"". All questions are answered and all the villains and heroes that need to die, to finish the saga, do so and become immortal. The empire is defeated, and Hans Solo gets his girl. The Ewoks save the day, and manage to do it without upsetting anybody's prejudice. Humans make a tasty ""roast beast""! The ""Special Edition"" with added scenes and enhanced picture and sound add a bit of ""snap"" to the whole thing. I still think that the Emperor was an unnecessary character and that Darth Vader was evil enough without him.

Not some Jedi named Rey and claims to be a skywalker just because she defeated an old rotten Palpatine with a cringy line ""I'm all the Jedi"" when Palpatine was ORIGINALLY killed by Darth Vader in this movie. This masterpiece captures all the aspects and doesn't fail to keep the audience to jump out of their seats. It's a tragedy that George Lucas gave the franchise to Disney in hope that they would make an amazing sequel, but was rather extremely disappointed. I hope the Obi Wan Kenobi series won't be ruined. It's a shame to call episodes 7,8 and 9 a part of the SW franchise. Back when SW was authentic and amazing.",0.0681818181818182,0.4454545454545455

I used to like the space battle and used to watch those parts while fast-forwarding the other parts of the final battle while watching the movie.

But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, I was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart.

Opening back on Tatooine you get right back into the fantasy as you watch Leia pull a wolf in sheep clothing trying to save Han.

Fast forward to the epic conclusion between the Rebellion and the empire we have all been waiting to see. From the incredibly visual space battle to the beautifully executed fight on the ground of Endor leaving you constantly dazzled and impressed. Finally the fight of good vs. evil and father vs. son, with the puppet master Sidious unlatching his final plan. The end leaving you stunned with Leia's big reveal and the love of Han and Leia being reunited. Oh, and did I mention the Ewoks against the stormtroopers? ",0.19430529787672646,0.5765203050917336
82,"Return of the Jedi is an example of a film that had to many changes before release.
Changing Chewbacca's planet to a teddy bear planet. removing Lucas's original idea of Luke going on a quest for revenge and replacing it with a reunion with daddy.
Jedi proves it's no simple task being a Star Wars film.
While the actors still give their all, the alien design is still good as are the landscapes.
It's the plot itself which kills it, not to mention some dumb character deaths (Boba Fett anyone?) Return of the Jedi lacked the darkness, depth and intensity of Empire.
I'll never be able to understand how anyone can rate this 9 or 10 stars. It's just plain bad.

384,"Luke finishes his Jedi training with Yoda to confront the Emperor, reach out to Darth Vader and save Han Solo from the clutches of Jabba The Hut. If I was honest in my criticism, I'd give this probably a 3 star rating as it is a little bit weaker than the two before it. Also the narrative is a tad disjointed as the beginning is Luke trying to rescue Han Solo, then you get the final training montage, then the Ewoks and then finally the confrontation. All of this works reasonably well, but it feels like you need to have seen the first two to understand the full scale of what is happening. My point is, it's a great sequel, but not as strong as a stand alone. That said, who cares? This sequel is the most character driven and has a lot of heart. There are two tragic death scenes that are moving and an epic light saber showdown climax that probably features the best action sequences in the series. Again, I was not at all disappointed in 1983, and like the others took my wife to rerelease in the 90s, because, sure I loved The Terminator, Rambo and Bruce Lee, but Star Wars was and always will be the cornerstone of my childhood.",0.23587962962962963,0.6419753086419753

The most eventful film of the series; however, this installment rarely tops the die-hard fans' list. Still, an overall great film; its only real downfall is the numerous rushed conclusions to some very key characters.

The scenes have even been modified to include the new elements, Don't get excited i don't mean the the new scenes added in 1999, what i am talking about is Boba's voice and the ending of ROTJ.
