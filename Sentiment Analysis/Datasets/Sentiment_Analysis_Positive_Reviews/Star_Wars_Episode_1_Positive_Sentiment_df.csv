1704,"Having been a huge Star Wars fan since a child, I was thrilled when Phantom Menace came out.  I saw it 4 times in the theater and loved it just the same.  But with Episode II almost in theaters, I feel a need to defend Episode I.  It was very different from the original trilogy with a variety of new elements.  Episode I showed children for the first time in the entire series, something I don't think many fans realized.  Jake Lloyd did the best he could with the character that was meant to act like goofy kid and not a lifeless slave.  Yes, the midiclorian-thing is rubbish and Jar Jar is the worst thing to ever happen in the series, but if you look past that, you'll see that Phantom Menace was a pretty good movie.  I think hype is what killed it.  I've noticed the hype around Ep. II is pretty subdued compared to Ep. I, and that's a good thing.  ",0.25849282296650716,0.6167304625199361

931,"Having grown up in the generation of the original Star Wars, and having spent my Summer in the movies watching the first Star Wars installment, upon finally seeing The Phatom Menace, I was scratching my head. This wasn't the Star Wars I fell in love with. In fact there's not much to love about this film. The ""story line"" is so convoluted and confusing, and the characters come and go so fast you can't figure out who they are. Lucas should have spent more time on creating an interesting story line worthy of Star Wars instead of relying on so many special effects (I felt like I was in a pinball machine with all the bright colors and glaring sounds) and bizarre costumes to distract us from the threadbare script. I started to watch this installment in hopes of watching ""Revenge of the Sith"" but now I have no intentions of seeing it.",0.2415922619047619,0.559672619047619
1939,"the plot is rather good and so is the direction some scenes feeling very epic but i think its the lame characters and acting that let this film down, none of the characters have the charisma of Han solo or Darth Vader, but that was not the main problem it was jar-jar he is the most annoying creation ever and should burn in the fiery pits of hell for all eternity . another thing is that i didn't feel exited like i did with the old movies it wasn't the plot that was pretty good but it was the actors all but Liam neeson (qui-gon)seemed out of place and to uncomfortable in there roles which is a big let down because all the actors from the old films seemed so alive and involved (it probably is because its mostly done on blue screen).

In January, I kept a running tally of how many days till the movie opened (starting at 125) and slowly watched as the number got smaller and smaller.  Well, last night I went to the movie after watching the original trilogy and spending the whole day (besides taking a final -- I'm in college) preparing for the movie.  I thought it was fantastic!  Wait - it was awesome.  When the movie was over I was almost in tears because I realized that I was going to have to wait another 3 years to see the next chapter.  There was no ""bad"" aspect about the movie.  The story, acting, pace, visual effects, dialogue -- they were all ""Star Wars"" caliber. After seeing it, I have no problem raking the movie as ""Star Wars.""",0.16093749999999998,0.4489583333333334

Not great, but good. I don't care how much CGI you pack into a movie, or how engrossing the images may be; I want better dialogue. The story was adequate for what Lucas set out to accomplish, but there were many scenes that seem to be just thrown in there to show off the computer images. THEY DIDN'T SERVE THE PLOT AND THAT IS MY MAJOR GRIPE ABOUT THIS FILM. Don't try to dazzle me with images. Make my want to see it again by telling a story that is hard to forget with interesting dialogue and compelling characters. The casting was dead on; you couldn't ask for a better queen or a little Skywalker. The Jedi Knights, Qui Gon and Obi Wan were great also........but some of the things they have to say are sometimes laughable. I love Star Wars movies; I really do. I just wanted more, and the hype that surrounds this movie will only prove to hinder its success. Episode II will be better; George Lucas has given us a taste of what's to come, and if he can develop an engrossing story with truly satisfying revelations, EVERYONE will love it, guaranteed.

I thought it was going to be off the wall, particularly since I was, well, eleven years old and I liked anything in movies which was flashy. And at that age, I loved the film when I went to watch it. It was fun, fast, and fantastic. Explosions, lasers, spaceships, what else could a kid ask for? Then I grew up. I watched the movie again when I was seventeen, and all I could do was gape in horror. I could have sworn I saw a different movie as a child, but going back through it, I couldn't believe that I had liked it so much. It really reminds me as to how my tastes have changed and how what I look for in a movie has changed. As an addition to the Star Wars saga, I didn't begrudge it at the time simply because it was, well, another chapter in the Star Wars saga. I loved watching one of my favorite film franchises play out on the big screen.

Absolutely breathtaking - the first time you see Coruscant at night or the cities of the Gungans, you'll just say, ""Wow.""

Darth Maul's screen time was considerably short lived and should have been implemented more with the Jedis.  The visual effects overwhelmed them movie completely and makes you wonder if those are even real actors on the screen and not just computer generated ones.

Young Anakin (Jake Lloyd) is fun to see, but he's too young for a lot of this. There's Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala- she's too weak at times. I had noticed this in the trailers.

They were all magic moments, and I was hoping to maybe relive a bit of my childhood by seeing the new Star Wars movie. But being a slightly cynical adult now, I'm afraid to say the magic is gone. I'll say some good things first. The light sabers sounded the same. The spaceships all roared the same way I'd remembered. The special effects and production design were as amazing as expected. But those things aren't what made the original Star Wars films some of the greatest films of all time. It was the magic moments. Like Luke looking forlornly at the tatooine sunset; the moment he switched off his targeting computer and gave away to the force; Yoda raising the X-wing out of the swamp. And so on.

I'll explain: I'm not even going to talk about the special effects, because that goes without saying. The interaction of Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon is breath taking and extremely deep.

Of course the first 3 movies are some of my favorite movies of all time, probably in the top ten. Expectations were way too high for Phantom Menace to begin with - but I have to fault Lucas for some major big league mistakes with this picture. First, Jar Jar Binks. This guy is irritating beyond all reason and sanity. I think Lucas was trying to imitate the successful Disney formula of an annoying jabbering sidekick. We could also do without the body fluid humor and what-not, it's just juvenile and has no place in a Star Wars film. A lot of the dialogue is forced and comes off flat. I know Jedis are supposed to be serious but come ON now. Ben Kenobi was never boring! Third, the plot was unimportant and not very involving. I guess it got the job done but the aliens didn't seem very menacing (the ones in Galaxy Quest were far more threatening!) and none of the characters made you care about them. Now - the plus side: the special effects have seen no equal since, and will not until Episode II. The podrace scene and the battle scenes are all expertly designed and executed. The music by John Williams is awesome as would be expected. And we have some good amounts of intrigue and suspense as a good setup for Episode II. I would advise you ask around before deciding to purchase this one, but you definitely can't go wrong with a rental.

It only relied a little upon your previous knowledge of the Star Wars mythos; I think the uninitiated will enjoy it just as much.  You Joseph Campbell fans out there looking for the same types of hero-myth cycle elements may have to wait for the other episodes, I think.  But there was one plot element setting you up (anakin's conception). Be prepared for some comedy relief elements that cater to the under-12 demographic (the Jar Jar Binks character and the race announcer(s) were silly, IMO). GREAT visuals, lots of good light saber play. Perhaps the strongest criticisms I have is that there were a couple of parts that felt too edited, like they were cut out for the sake of movie length or something- or underdeveloped.  It wasn't disjointed, necessarily, but seemed maybe a bit skimmed-over in parts (maybe it was just the script and directing).  Example: I thought Darth Maul could have been developed more. I'm sure we will see plenty more of the Sith in Ep.2&3, but I felt this character would have been able to play a bigger role in the overall plot (I expected as much, given that his face is all over the place!).  In fact, now that I am thinking about it, the difference between this and the other movies, and perhaps the source of some of the criticism, I think, is that there was not the clear definition of primary hero or primary villain (like Luke/Darth).  In fact, the best-developed character was Jar-Jar, whom I wanted to see least.   That makes it hard for many viewers (critics?) to swallow, as we are bred on this formula. Also, a sorta-scientific explanation was given about the nature of The Force, which took a little away from its mystic appeal, IMHO.",0.17647058823529416,0.5070261437908498

Rest assured, Phantom Menace does entertain, but it is going to need the rest of the trilogy to be appreciated.  If 'Empire' and 'Jedi' were never made, Star Wars would still be a landmark film, but Menace relies heavily on the big picture.  It serves as an appetizer for the main course to come.

I know sequels can never outshine the original although in some cases, they do and Empire Strikes Back is a great example; directed by Irvin Kershner. Yes the film has dazzling special effects and the light saber duel at the end is great, but when the dialog is so putrid and contrived and the acting so wooden and lifelessly constipated, it leaves one feeling how Lucas can stoop so low. Characters such as Qui-Gon Jin, Ben Kenobi, and Amidala are barely developed; leaving them nothing more than vapid souls against the uninspired screenplay. The other characters such as the Gungan leader and Watto, are basically blatant racial stereotypes. To make matters worse, they casted a child actor as Anakin, played to imperfection by that little pint-sized muppet Jake Loyd. And last but not least, the most hated hated character in the SW universe Jar Jar Binks, who should've died a VERY HORRIBLE DEATH at the righteous hand of the sadly underused Darth Maul!! The original trilogy had its fare share of corny dialog, but not the extent that this movie provides. All in all, TPM fumbled critically with fans and critics and I happen to be one of them because Lucas has lost his touch with what made the original so enamored and charming: Genuine excitement. Had he filmed the prequels first back in the late '70s, then the originals later on, it could've been even greater. But as it stands, TPM is a forgettable giant pile of excrement that should forever be flushed down the cinematic toilet.",0.02286178655859506,0.5228554542384329
385,"When I was younger I would tell others, I wish there were more Star Wars films. In 1999 my wish came true when Lucas decided to create The Phantom Menace, The first of the 3 pre-quels. This film is action packed; and superb acting from veteran actors Neeson, MacGregor, and Mc Diarmid. In my opinion too much CGI can ruin films, but it's cheaper and cost efficient.
The Phantom Menace begins when Supreme Chancellor Valorium ( Terrance Stamp) sends two Jedi Qui-Gon Gen( Liam Neeson), and His apprentice, Obi-Wan-Kenobi ( Ewan Mac Gregor), to negotiate with the Trade Federation. When the negotiations fail, because Darth Sidious ( Ian Mc Diarmid) tells Viceroy Gunray to eliminate the Jedi.
When the Jedi escape they flee to the planet Naboo. Once there they are caught in the middle of a ground invasion. It's a droid army invasion ordered by Darth Sidious. When Qui-Gon is escaping he saves a local Gun-Gun. Gun-Gun's also live on Naboo, but are considered 2nd class by the Nebuians. Qui-Gon ask Jar Jar( Amehd Best) to be taken to see the leader of the Gun-Gun's. Jar Jar Binks is strange, and was banished because of his clumsiness. The three go to the secret underworld city, where Qui-Gon talks to Boss Nass, the Gun-Gun leader. There he realizes that Jar-Jar is to be axed, but Qui-Gon explains that Binks owes him a life-debt. Boss Nass is lets Jar jar go with the 2 Jedi and provides them transportation through the planets core. Jar Jar navigates them, to the top of Naboo. Once they arrive they rescue Queen Padme Amidala ( Natalie Portman), who is leader of Naboo. She is watching her people suffer, and is being pressured to sign a treaty against her will. Once the Jedi find the queen, she flees with the Jedi in her Nubian Star Ship. ",0.1714646464646465,0.29074074074074074

The rich characters and emotions shown by those characters is what makes star wars: the phantom menace every bit as good as the original trilogy. I am only 19 and did not see the first three installments in the theaters and maybe this is what makes the phantom menace to me more special than the originals.

That's the one moment in this film that had my jaw on the floor, the lightsaber duel coming in a close second. I have to agree that this film could have used more heart and a Han Solo archetype to balance out the seriousness; perhaps those two would go hand-in-hand.  It's an entertaining film, but not much more than that.  One final thought:  a lot of people, including author Peter David, are bitching about how the midi-chlorians have invalidated the whole spiritual basis of the Force.

After seeing the Phantom Menace I left the theater feeling satisfied and anticipating the release of episode 2 more then ever.  One major criticism I have is that the special effects should have been tamed down at the start of the movie.  The effects should have been very progressive and built up, this would have made the decline even more amazing.  Some critics have said Jar Jar Binks is one of the major down falls of the movie, I disagree.  He is such a minor character (yet not so minor if you pay attention to the plot) that he could never ruin a movie of such grand proportion.  Jar Jar is a good and humorous character, who although adds quite a bit of goofiness at times serves his purpose.  Perhaps we should learn to deal and cope with JarJar as the characters in the story do.  Very strong performances by Neeson and McGregor.  Portman also shows some very promising acting skills, I hope to see her in some future roles (she sure is cute =) ).  While on the other hand, Jake Lloyd could have used a little more coaching in his deliverance of certain lines which came out quite artificially.  We must take into consideration his young age and inexperience and we must also note that he looked the part and played certain scenes very well.  Speaking of scenes, the pod race and final sword fight scenes were awesome! My adrenaline was going full throttle as I rooted for the good guys and hoped for the best. So, as you can see I was certainly pleased with the production and I highly recommend you see the film as soon as possible. But let me point out that if you aren't a fan of the first Star Wars series that you will not like this one.",0.2946965939153438,0.5876587301587302
3871,"For everyone who has been panning this movie, this is just a few words on the subject. 1.  This is not the full picture of what George Lucas intends to show us, and as Star Wars fans we should realize this going into the movie.  With Star Wars in 1977, Lucas set up a vision that anything subsequent would follow.  This led to what I feel is the most brilliant chapter in the epic, ""The Empire Strikes Back.""  By watching the original movie again you can see that in the back of Lucas's mind he knew where the saga would go if he was able to continue it.  Just watch the scenes where Obi-Wan is explaining Anakin to Luke, the expressions on Sir Alec Guiness' face are priceless. To me this shows the genius of G. Lucas. 2.  It is a movie, whose basic premise is 'symbiotic relationships,' in other words good and evil, the Naboo and the Gungans and master and student. It shows the way that one relates and must get along with the other in order to survive. 3.  If this strikes you as too kid-friendly, just pause a moment and consider what is to come with Episode II & III: the Jedi purge, the conversion of Anakin to the Dark Side and Chancelor Palpatine's ascension to ultimate power in the universe.  This is going to be some dark stuff and will not end on a happy note, like the end of ""Return of the Jedi.""  This was pretty much Lucas' only chance at a happy ending in this continuation of the saga. 4.  I got hooked on these movies when I was a child, and my fascination carried over to my adulthood.  Originally, around the time of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" Lucas stated that there would be 9 Episodes to the saga(3 trilogies in all), after the original trilogy, he took a 15 year hiatus from them and now here we are.  Personally, I am just glad to have him making these vital movies again. 5.  To address all the negative criticisms I have read about the film, here I go.  No, the Trade Federation is not a replacement of the Empire, they are merely puppets of the Sith.  Just think of them as the inept Empirial officers of the original trilogy, like Admiral Ozzel, who carried out the orders of Vader.  Next, Jar-Jar is not that bad(he is a bit annoying), but he fits into the mythology of the series by providing comic relief and bringing the Gungans and the Naboo together, so they may overcome the Dark forces in the universe.  So forth, the various reports of stereotyping of racial groups in this film are far-fetched.  The dialects and speaking manners of characters that do not exist has to come from somewhere, and I believe Lucas went to pains to try and include other cultural habits in this film, more than any other, in an attempt to flatter, not to hurt anyone. It felt as if he was attempting to step beyond all the white people, who were in Star Wars to include the other races of this planet.  Also, the main race if any that I feel would be most offended by any of the movies, would be the British from the original trilogy. 6.  Now just one gripe.  A few years ago, I went to see a little film called ""Braveheart,"" and was blown away by the battle scenes.  Now it seems that everyone in Hollywood feels a need to restage their own version of these scenes, and I am ashamed to say that it appears that Lucas fell into that category in ""Episode I.""  The final battle scenes between the Gungans and the Trade Federation Battle Droids, although they blow you away with special effects, they seem to me to lack in the originality department. All in all though, this is a great beginning for the Star Wars saga, and it will keep me coming back as the original trilogy.",0.13674812030075187,0.5072472848788638

However I can't turn a blind eye on its flaws first of all Padme is not that interesting as a character and this is an a problem with just this movie it's a problem with the whole prequel trilogy as a whole, the second problem is Jar Jar who is mixed when it comes to humor and in the end doesn't feel that a Star Wars character unfortunately, and last but not least Jake Lloyd is Anakin is to put it bluntly not good however I don't approve the bullying he got as a kid but I feel like definitely without a doubt Lucas should've hired either someone who good at directing children or cast somebody older as Anakin. In the end The Phantom Menace for me is just ok with a lot of great moments however the film has flaws that I can't ignore but hey it's not the worst Star Wars movie.

If you had problems with it go see it again (as well as the original trilogy), amazing.  The acting was flawless.  Many might ask What About Jar Jar?? Well Jar Jar was just fine he fit into the story perfectly and is a great first step for a character that will develop greatly over the next three, ask anyone who is not between 16 and 30 and they will most likely say that Jar Jar was one of their favorite characters.  Also I have never seen a movie cut like Phantom was.  I believe this is the reason most people are saying go see it twice before you rate it.  The movie moves so fast and jumps around so much in order to give you all that you can handle in two hours and 15 minutes that you literally have to see it twice just so it can all sink in.

Then, after too many, too long previews, the Lucasfilm logo and that familiar soundtrack lit up the screen, followed by the most famous words in cinematic history. Those first few moments were my favorite in the movie.  I describe myself as one of the countless sencond-generation SW lovers.  And I'm a die-hard fanatic. But George, where's the emotion??  The Phantom Menace is not a bad movie. I will recommend it to my friends.  But, although the effects were smashing and the technology mind-blowing, I felt a huge chunk of the Star Wars appeal was missing from Phantom. You've read it elsewhere, and here it is again: You just don't feel for the characters.  No romance, no Harrison Ford (okay guys, and no Princess Leia in bikini), and no heartbreaking scenes.  The final lightsaber battle wasn't bad in that regard, but when Neeson's character was killed, I didn't feel as I did when Obi-wan died in ANH.  Why?? I don't know. The actors here are talented, but I feel someone told them not to ACT!! Natalie Portman is undeniably gifted, but she seems so dispassionate throughout.  The film could have been greatly enhanced by a little emotion on everyone's behalf. I did not like the ""touching"" scene between Ani and his mother.  Not only was it forced and unbelievable, the dialogue was not the quality of the first trilogy. I understand that, following the traditional three-act play format, George will introduce everyone here, then develop his characters in future films. I hope so. Enough rotten tomatoes.  I DID love the final lightsaber battle-there was something ultimately menacing about Darth Maul's double-edged saber.  But why must every saber battle take place beside an open pit??  And I'm so glad the Jawas made an appearance at the Podrace to deliver a resounding Ootidi! I suppose the things that pleased me most were those that reminded me of the first trilogy. My final word:  I loved the foreshadowing of the impeding rise of the Dark Side--the reference to the Dark Lords and the profile shot of young Anakin and Senator Palpatine.  But then came the ending--just too darn HAPPY!!  I was looking for something a little more suspenseful, something that will lead into the coming films.

Let's put this in perspective.  This movie will be constantly compared to its predecessors, which in my mind is a little unfair.  In all fairness, 'Phantom' should not be critiqued and analyzed and brought to the mercy of film critics until the series is complete.  Reason being is this movie was not meant to be a stand alone and therefore should not be judged as such.  Those saying that this film in not a Star Wars caliber movie are being a bit hasty.  When the prequels are complete we will see exactly how 'Phantom' stands and its actual potency as a 'begin all' film.  I think most true die hard Star Wars fans, like myself, will accept this film as that, an adequate starting point for more to come.

Some scenes stick out to me as very enjoyable though; The PodRacing Scene and The Final Battle/Qui-Gon's death scene in particular.

3978,"Let's face it, this was the ""Star Wars"" movie for me to grow up with. So even though it was smashed by critics I didn't really care. However I recently saw it again and I start to understand the criticism. First issue to me: The pace. Especially over the first half of the movie it doesn't take a breath and you get absolutely no idea of the characters. These characters then are jumping from space ship to planet to get to a city underwater, just to ride through the planets core (seriously? even star wars had THAT much logic so far) to get to save a queen/princess (doesn't that sound like a Disney cartoon? Oh, the irony). The problem is that none of these sections feel to be given more than 10 minutes screen time. Like many people before me I too think that a lot of these scenes could have easily been cut out or be replaced with more storytelling. I really think Lucas was a little too much into CGI here. My second issue is the way-through comic tone. I think giving the battle droids a little humor is not a bad choice. But at least the Gungans are way over the top. This is getting especially nerving in actually serious scenes like the big battle in the end. This pretty much kills the atmosphere and makes the movie feel very childish which is in the end what killed it for me. My last big issue is its integration in the overall star wars synopsis. Looking at the plot (not exactly the way it was acted out) this appears to be a fine story in the star wars universe. But let's face it the only thing it really did for star wars was to show Anakin Skywalkers roots and introduce him to his future wife. What I really enjoyed was its cast. Even not in his best role I'm a big fan of Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson. Natalie Portman is okay too. I'm only nerved by young Anakin. Of course the movie has its moments too, especially the final light saber battle and the pot race (which is completely unnecessary).",0.11850340136054421,0.49098639455782306

Usage of CGI was unrestrained and got annoying after a while. I felt like saying ""Okay, I see that you got lots of money and people to use on computer graphics; stop it already."" and what's worse, they didn't look all that realistic. The magic of the first 3 Star Wars saga was gone on this movie, where visual effects were truly revolutionary, and the concept unquestionably so also. This was just another sci-fi movie.

There is love for the prequels, more so now than ever, and there is a reason for it.

It's certainly far superior to the sequels of the original, neither of which Lucas directed. There's more of a focus on the characters here than in the previous films (Lucas brings in a heavyweight in Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor has already established himself as an actor of some repute) but there's plenty of attention to detail and the look of the film itself is a dense, roving kaleidoscope with an emphasis on the burnished browns and dark reds that may be an influence from Kurosawa's color films. (Indeed the concept of `Star Wars' itself seems directly influenced by Kurosawa.) Some of the action sequences, such as the pod race that is the centerpiece of the film, may seem overly familiar but they're deftly handled and exciting nonetheless. Lucas is clearly in love with chivalry and his fight scenes are filled with motivations of honor, dignity and justice.

But people who let themselves get distracted by this, mis-interpret it and thus, take an instant disliking to the film. But concentrate on what many perceive it to be its flaws and you see that it's the films and overall, the trilogys greatest strength.  It shows how even the smallers things can have a bearing on the bigger picture, from a small time senator of Naboo promoted to the ruler of the galaxy and how the Jedi Knights trigger a count down to their own destruction, by taking a young boy away from his mother. George Lucas should be given credit for trying to do things differently and not hanging off the coat tails of his original films.

Sure, the characters dialogue is more stilted, but this is the Victorian area of the star wars universe (you will notice the dialogue loosens up somewhat in Episode 2). So basically, the galaxy is peaceful but theres a few things rumbling and its these smaller things which will shape every film following it.

It's about story telling, not about the individual episodes.

What awaited me in the theatre was one of the most breathtaking films I had seen in years.  The special effects may look 'too' animated during the previews, but once you're in the theatre, it looks more realistic than the originals. Some of the dialogue was stupid, and that's about the only negative criticism I can think of.  I wonder if the dialogue and the voice were meant to be so ""corny""?

Ewan McGregor fits in Obi-wan's boots very nicely and Liam Neeson is perfect as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. But the real star here is Darth Maul, played by the extraordinary Ray Park. With his double-edged lightsaber, gravity-defying acrobatics, and wicked Sith tattoos, Maul clocks in as one of the baddest villains in the Star Wars universe.

We were placed in a world already thought of, already in full swing. As a viewer I didn't have huge expectations when i went to see this film. I was excited, I simply thought of it as finally reading the beginning of a book that I loved as a child. The worlds were new and exciting the scale was very large but as with all movies repeat viewings always brings better understanding. The way Palatine effortlessly guides the queen and the senate to bring himself one step closer to power is amazing and the fact that (GL) came up with it himself is a testament to him and the reason he is the one in sky walker ranch and we are sitting in our apartment giving our reasons for weather or not we like or dislike his films",0.29840613931523025,0.5762347500983865

Actually, all the reviews looked like they'd been done by the same critic, but that's another matter.  The critics are not wrong.  They just weren't really watching the movie.  They pretended to look for deep meaning in vain, yet missed all of the subtle satire and double meanings hidden within the movie. To be honest, I wasn't looking for the greatest movie of all time.  I just wanted to see a new Star Wars movie.  And Phantom Menace delivered.  And this episode works so well in conjunction with the other films.  If you know the story for episodes 4-6, Phantom Menace takes on a whole different tone. You know who Palpatine is.  You know who Darth Sidious is.  And you know who Anakin is. That's it - Just go see it - whether or not you've seen the others. This movie can and will stand on its own.

If people look too much into it, they will forget a very important fact, it's ONLY Star Wars, and it is not meant to be some life-changing experience. It's only the critics who think that, at least that's my opinion. It is meant to be a simple story of good vs. evil that the whole family can enjoy. People say it appears to be made for a younger audience, and I agree, but it also has a lot to offer to the older crowd as well. The funny thing, though, was how similar the story line is to that of A New Hope (Episode IV). Exact same idea. a Queen is in danger, and a young Skywalker from Tatooine comes to the rescue. Obi-Wan has an influence on the Skywalker. R2-D2 and C3PO are there, and a younger apprentice must see their master die. In the end, there is a celebration, and the queen honors the victors. the end.

(Though not quite photo realistic. Have to wait for episode three I believe.) The plot is the weak point of this film.  George Lucas doesn't really do a good job of explaining the background.  As a result, the film feels more like the first chapter of a long book, than a complete movie.  If you've read all the comics, and novels, you might understand the background.  That's not good film making, however. Despite the lack of background, Jar Jar Binks, and a major plot loophole at the end, I enjoyed The Phantom Menace.

And, to tell you the truth, the only reason I saw this one was because my nine-year-old brother wasn't allowed to see it and I wanted to make him jealous. But then I ended up tacking a poster of Anakin Skywalker to my door and buying the movie novelization of this. Why? Because it turned out to be a decent movie after all! Jake Lloyd is what makes this movie good. That kid is so cute and irresistably charming. It's sad to think that Anakin will grow up to be Darth Vader. I didn't exactly get WHY this movie was happening but I guess I did get the general plot. ANAKIN! ANAKIN! ANAKIN! Go Anakin! I LOVE that kid. I hope he returns for episodes 2 and 3. And Jar Jar was, um, an interesting character, although I couldn't understand half of what he was saying. I guess I would give this movie two and a half stars out of four. Of course, based on Jake Lloyd's performance I would probably give that a three and a half out of four. So, see this movie if ya want some entertainment. It's very decent, and even if you don't like STAR WARS you might find this enjoyable. I don't think kids aged nine and under would really understand it, but there is nothing inappropriate.

Whats' so surprising about it though is just how dated it is next to the originals, and his attempts at spicing up the technology (double headed lightsabres) only contradicts the original trilogy as it is set BEFORE those times, not AFTER.
