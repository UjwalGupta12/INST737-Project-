You spend days preparing the food, then as you plate up you pour two buckets of salt on top of everything. Your wonderful well made food ruined under a mountain of salt. This is exactly what the director did in the Last Jedi, he destroyed it. It was overlong, far too conscious of itself with crude plot twists and no love for the characters. It was as if an alien had landed on earth and never seen the other films and just made it in an afternoon. The words Last are very meaningful, it's the last time I will go to a Star Wars film, the Last time I will care about a star wars film and the last time any fan will have hope of seeing a film fans deserve.

"Honestly, as I was watching this all I could say that is was really, really boring. It simply seemed to drag on with little happening. Okay, I've probably earned the wrath of all the Star Wars fans out there, but honestly, I'm really starting to wonder whether this new trilogy is really all that worth it. In the end the film really seemed to be going nowhere, and simply had no purpose in it at all. In fact the entire storyline really could have been squeezed into the first third of a movie by simply cutting out all of the irrelevant stuff, and in my opinion there is quite a lot of it. Okay, there were some surprises, and it did end well, but having to sit through this film just to get to the end really wasn't worth it, and just to think that I have to go and see it again simply because my brother loves Star Wars.
 I'm not really all that sure if there is all that much I can say about it, other than it is basically the rebels attempting to escape from the First Order (read Empire). In fact that is basically the movie, which is why I found it so boring. They start off evacuating a base (aka Empire Strikes Back), and are then chased through intersellar space, before arriving at another planet where they attempt to fight off the First Order, fail, and manage to escape. Oh, and we also have Rey on the island with Luke attempting to convince him to come and help them with the fight against the First Order, while Luke is basically not wanting anything to do with anyone anymore.
 As a friend suggested, in the end it is the original characters that are the best, and this new lot are simply trying to take the shine away from what were some awesome characters. There is no way that BB8 can ever outshine R2D2, and the only reason I didn't give the film a lower score was because they still had R2 in the movie - and Chewie, who is also pretty awesome. But these new characters, I'm really not all that sure about them.
 Oh, and the whole idea of them travelling in lightspeed is absolutely ridiculous. Really, most people would know that in the grand scheme of things light speed is really, really slow, and that was something that really put me off the first movie. Surely the creators of this film were familiar with the originals, and would have known that they used the word 'hyperspace' instead of 'lightspeed'. Look, I'll probably end up going and seeing the next few movies, but I'm not all that impressed with where it is heading. Then again, I didn't actually mind the prequels (and I still consider C3P0 to be much more annoying that Jar-Jar Binks, but then again I'm not a huge fan of Jar-Jar either).",0.11169274714356682,0.5040389255553189

"This is an example of writing for the middle school masses. Not yet bright enough (well not all) to be critical, and with little history of seeing cheap inaccurate redundancies. 
1. Centuries from now fighter craft w/combustion flaming propulsion? Please!
2. Everyone is still wearing what looks like WWII surplus clothing, and the purple dyed hair in Vice Admiral (what does the Navy have to do with all this) - how late 1900s. 
3. Sound effects dominate the movie (a crutch I suppose for lazy writing & research) in the vacuum of space (or just anywhere to add effect). Also, overbearing music though out to add effect a form of cheap action subbing. 
4. Lots of dumbed down simplistic dialogue thus showing no desire to educate an audience or require thought.
5. Same old storyline - boringly predictable.
6. Too heavy a reliance on the same old visuals of things burning in space which incidentally would also fail middle school science. Also, the accelerations/decelerations - not possible especially for living occupants. More dumbing down.

"I visibly cringed while watching this pile of vomit. Everything sacred was torn down and buried. Subvert expectations is an excuse for gross negligence, perhaps even malicious intent.
Jedi training matters, no one is born to the art and skill. Ancient Jedi teachings matter, wisdom matters, no knowledge should be burned. Murder is not the Jedi way, especially of unarmed individuals presumed guilty before innocent. Credible character arcs are born of flawed journeys. Giant characters built up over time should not be eliminated in ridiculous and implausible manners, without adequate back story and closure.
I was emotionally detached from this mess, and retained no affinity or attraction. It is utterly unwatchable, even repulsive. I have never witnessed such a rabid and rapid destruction of a franchise.

"If TFA was a slap in the face, then The Last Jedi is a knife in your guts. It's a horrendously badly written, focusless, directionless, awfully long, stinking mess from yet again a director who does not have the faintest idea what Star Wars is about.
TLJ reveals that there absolutely never was a story for Disney's sequel trilogy, after all. There are no character arcs either (save for, maybe, Kylo's). The only 'grand idea' they had was to kill our old heroes one by one and destroy everything they stood for. To destroy everything we loved about Star Wars.
Did they at least replace them with something worthy? Well, since from Finn to Phasma, from Maz to Hux, from Snoke to the new characters (Rose, Admiral Holdo, or the Codebreaker) everybody proves to be nothing but filler (even more so than in the already dreadful TFA), the answer is a definite No.

"""Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi"" (2017), and I thought Episode VII was bad! Before I get into the real meat of my review, I must talk about Carrie Fisher. Knowing that Carrie Fisher died right after completing her work for this ""movie"", I was hoping she would go out on a high note in this ""film"". But no, her character was unconscious throughout most of the ""movie"". Don't even get me started on Leia embracing her inner Mary Poppins by floating through space! One thing that could have maybe (MAYBE) redeemed this ""movie"" somewhat, is that they could have had Luke and Leia back together. They do have a scene with both of them together on-screen. But, in the actual ""story"" Luke is not really there. He is only appearing there using the force, that really aggravated me. I hate how they depicted Luke's character in this ""movie""! But, we'll get to that later. All I have to say to the spirit of Carrie Fisher is: I'm sorry that you had to be involved in such a travesty of a ""film"" for your last role. I promise that I will stick to Episodes 1-6 from here on out, the real ""Star Wars"" movies. Rest in peace, Carrie Fisher. As for the rest of this ""movie"", it's boring, dull, obnoxious and once again a waste of casting. Especially on Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher's part! The only good qualities are the soundtrack and the special effects. The sets/locations are boring, the acting is all over the place, and the story? What story? What did I just watch? Probably the thing that infuriated me the most about this ""movie"" was how they depicted Luke. His character does not care about the Jedi order, and he made the Episode 7 cliffhanger entirely pointless. Also, he refuses to help save the resistance. Unbelievable! Right? This is not the Luke I know, where did the real Luke go? Even Mark Hamill himself, who plays Luke, regrets being in this ""film""! What does that tell you? To anyone who likes this ""movie"", please get a brain-scan. If you have seen this, and hate it like almost everyone else with a functioning brain does, I just have to say I'm sorry you had to see it. I'm not even going to bother with Episode 9! I give this ""film"" only 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Stay away from this ""movie"", just go and watch the real ""Star Wars"" movies (EPISODES 1-6) instead.

"How to ruin Star Wars? Sell the rights to Disney!
This movie is yet another massive disappointment following Force Awakens, which as much as I disliked it was a tad better than The Last Jedi. There is nothing left here of the Star Wars universe except for the non-Jedi's repeating the ""May the force be with you"", which they say with such conviction you can tell its just some lame tagline they implemented so the viewer wouldn't forget they were actually watching a Star Wars movie.
In 'Force Awakens' I actually enjoyed the prospect of there being yet another massively powerful Sith overlord, Snoke being introduced to the story as some massively shadowy figure, turns it out its just a malformed humanoid with force power who despite his incredible ""power"" missed the all-too important detail of a lightsaber being moved by the force right next to him, as if he had suddenly lost his force power or become blind to it, both being just as improbable and ludicrous to any actual Star Wars fan.
The whole thing about wanting the very concept of ""Jedi"" to die out seems a tad shortsighted as that won't take away the force which is supposedly a universal force (like ""gravity"") and the universe will still yield force sensitives over time, leaving them without guidance and knowledge seems like a sure way to have them seek guidance with those that still stand, the Sith. 
Yoda finally learning to talk is beyond everything, why stick with continuity when you can screw everything around by changing its most memorable and enjoyable feature? Its like if Arnold Schwarzenegger suddenly started speaking with a perfect high class British accent for no apparent reason. This shows just how little concern Disney has for the Star Wars ""world"" and how ready they are to reshape it to their liking, using the fact that they can stick ""Star Wars"" on it to guarantee sales. They just don't care about the actual, pre-established Star Wars universe.
I don't get their constant need to keep going back to Maz as if she was the universe Wikipedia. Got a question? ""Maz"" it! (you know, instead of ""Google it!""), for reasons unknown, she'll have all the answers. It just comes off as way too easy a solution to people's quandaries.
Furthermore I really don't like how Disney has even redefined the whole Jedi movement and what they were able to do, it seems like a completely new thing now than the normal ""Jedi""-ism we're used to, now it involves levitating and meditating leading to out-of-body projections, of course, why didn't we see that coming?! 
Luke's sacrifice seemed unnecessary at best, it just seemed to mirror Obiwan Kenobi's sacrifice from Episode IV. And it was quite unluckily planned as Carrie Fisher passed away, both twins will be missing in the next movie, unless of course they decide to go the CGI way again to resurrect past actors (which I hope they won't do as the renditions from Rogue One were extremely creepy and very unsettling to watch, couldn't they find any actor on a planet of 7 billion people that could do the parts? did they even look?)
I could go on dissecting this rather large heap of dung which is 'The Last Jedi' but the Disney Star Wars have already sapped enough of my time, time I'll never get back! I cry for the death of Star Wars as we knew it, why it had to be sold to Disney before completing the last trilogy I will never understand.

"The Last Jedi is one giant cinematographic anticlimax. Each sequence had a twist for the sake of a twist. Each time, the chosen twist was always the lesser of the interesting possibilities the resolution could offer. Each scene had a build up that lead to an anticlimax.
Examples:
1) Set-Up: Luke gets his blue light saber back. The biggest buildup at the end of The Force Awakens. Two years in the wait to see what Luke is going to do.
Anticlimax: Luke throws the light saber away over his head in a slapstick manner.
2) Set-up: Is Admiral Holdo a traitor?
Anticlimax: Apparently she's not, she just wanted to hide her plan (of saving The Resistance) from everybody without any apparent reason, creating forced conflict.
3) Set-up: DJ explains the war economy to Finn and Rose and shows that the weapon dealers sell weapons to both The First Order AND The Resistance.
Anticlimax: Finn and Rose ignore it completely and pretend this discussion never happened.
4) Set-up: We finally meet Snoke, the new biggest Dark Side villain of the galaxy. Who is he?
Anticlimax: He's nobody, Snoke is killed off in the most anticlimactic and convenient way possible; and this in the middle of the movie!
5) Set-up: Rey is finally getting the answer of who her parents are.
Anticlimax: She is a nobody. Her drunk parents sold her to Unkar Plutt when she was a child. They then died and were buried somewhere on Jakku in a mass grave.
6) Set-up: The big climactic build-up of the battle on Crait where Luke walks towards The walkers of The First Order. The music builds and Luke is ready to do some serious force-s***.
Anticlimax: Luke was using a projection of himself, Force-broadcasting it from Ahch-To to leave some time for The Resistence to escape. This drained his energy and killed him apparently.
The Last Jedi felt like making love to the woman of your dreams, and right before you come she stops you, pushes you away, and tells you to leave for not apparent reason. You are just dumbstruck thinking ""What!?""

Casting A-list actors like Benicio Del Toro for small roles is another example of a weird choices.
The rhythm was off. Wen the subplot started about Finn and Rose going to Canto Bight, the movie started to drag. Then, when the Crait battle started, everything was rushed. All the interesting questions The Force Awakens asked were answered in a rush.

But it was a GOOD homage that introduced more new things than it relied on old. Last Jedi takes all that was good about the preceding movie and flushes it down the toilet. The tone is all wrong.

"This film was not what I expected to be. So much hype was built around it, that I was excited to watch. When finally watching, I was so dissappointed. I was expecting it to be on par with The Empire Strikes Back, except this was no where near as great. 
What this film contained was many side plots that were very unnecessary and many awkward moments within the characters. The original characters even lacked the charm they had in the original trilogy.
1. The romantic plots? Really? It's just awkward. 2. Kylo trying to pursuade Rey to join him? I felt like I was watching an awkward porno when the step brother tries getting it on with his step sister when Mom and dad aren't around... yeah, no, weird.
3. Luke Skywalker is no Ben Kenobi. Ben was a nice old man. Luke is as grumpy as Red Foreman from That 70s Show. 
Being a Star Wars fan for the last 22 years, I am greatly disappointed. There is no heart, nor great story to this addition of the series. The actors seem bored, and Kylo is just another Anakin Slywalker, whiny.
Overall, if you have kids and want to watch a decent action film, go ahead. If not, who cares?As many people have said, Disney has ruined Star Wars and it shows.

"This was the movie where the new trilogy had to come into its own, and God knows Johnson tried (even though the skeleton is Empire Strikes Back), but like the prequels it fails.
Unlike the prequels the fault is not in the direction or the acting, but solely with the script.
The plotholes are so huge you can drive several tanker trucks through them - sideways. Character motivations are practically non-existent or are so horribly shallowly explained they don't resonate at all, and the force is now basically a deux ex machina where characters can pull force powers of hitherto unseen or unheard of strengths out of nowhere simply to facilitate the plot - or get the writer out of a sticky situation. 
Add to that a subplot that goes nowhere and means nothing, simply to have specific characters in a specific location at a specific time, and you've got nothing short of a contrived mess of a script.
This is a shame as this movie has a lot of potential and with a better thought out script could have been really good.

"After seeing The Last Jedi at the cinema last December and being somewhat underwhelmed I was stunned to find out yesterday how little replay value this newest installment in the sprawling space saga holds. I literally couldn't make it through that dragging excuse of a story. Everything the rebellion does is either downright stupid or totally in vain or both. It's a long drawn out exercise in failure peppered with too many bits of comic relief and incessant soulsearching. The prequels were lacking in almost every respect, but at least I enjoyed revisiting them from time to time, they were fun, the storyteller's intentions seemed honest. Not so with the sequels, especially The Last Jedi. It's not only downbeat and endlessly meandering but also mean spirited in its attitude towards the source material. It's willfully disappointing viewer's expectations in the crudest and often least original way possible. You start to choke as if Vadder himself was extending his force grip over the audience. It's all so pointless and half-hearted. The rebellion gets decimated to literally a handful people, but it all seems to be fun and games for the characters, even the bad guys, with a lot of naive pep talk about the spark of the resistance thrown in every ten minutes or so. It's like the director undertook to disappoint viewer's expectations so radically, that we the audience end up with nothing but this choking feeling of disappointment. In fact, the narrative strategy forever flip-flops between those failed expectations and the constant lip service that is paid to the loyal fanbase.

But Rian Johnson had different objectives for the character...
After the ending of The Force Awakens, I think I talk for everyone here, we were expecting for the best for the next film.
Then Johnson happened... An amateur film director that took a story bigger than him, took the responsability of characters he shouldn't have had. He literally destroyed everything Abrams built for what could have been the best freaking Star Wars movie the world could've seen.

"Bottom Line: The Last Jedi was a pointless story with pointless character deaths that undermined the Star Wars universe.
Maybe Disney knows how to make money and good movies are just not the way. This new trilogy is doing very well for Disney, but is a mashup of recycled clips that completely miss the point of why they were there originally. Middle movies are always difficult, but The Last Jedi was particularly devastating to the Star Wars universe. As a Star Wars fan, I'm a little tired of the ""good guys"" being the underdogs and fighting the big evil. These movies would have been much more believable and interesting if the Republic was starting to reestablish itself and the First Order was becoming a credible ISIS like threat. Snoke ended up being a non-player in this new universe, so they should have skipped him completely and had Kylo Ren as a want-to-be emperor instead of a want-to-be Darth Vader.
These movies have no discernible theme, so far. The original 6 were about the redemption of Anakin through a prophecy that said he would destroy the Sith, but left out that he would destroy the Jedi and himself in the process (the force needs balance after all). The Jedi were the imbalance and Anakin set the force right by embracing the dark side and destroying them all. These larger themes are forgotten in this new trilogy leaving them hollow with little more to think about than what merchandising will come from them. What is more difficult to grasp is that most of the plot elements dead ended leaving you with the feeling that you wasted all of that precious screen time.
One of the greatest tragedies was how R2-D2 was left as a nostalgic prop. In the original 6 R2-D2 was the one who guided the fate of the galaxy by subtle influence on everyone else, and was the only character who knew the whole story from beginning to end. In The Last Jedi he is nothing more than an old robot and his significance was missed completely.
A few interesting things that occurred if we view the movie as a series of clips, Force Skyping was an interesting addition to a universe that did not have this type of communication in 1977. The concept of good and evil being a matter of perspective, how arms dealers sold to both sides, and how the Force is bigger than the Jedi were more realistic elements then the black and whiteness of the original view of the world.
There are too many ridiculous plot elements to go through here, such as the resistance fleet very slowly getting away for the entire movie, and Rey being upset by Kylo Ren not wearing a shirt as if the destroyed AT-AT remnant she was living under in the desert her entire life as a scavenger had strict fashion protocols.
Overall, it's another mish mash of recycled concepts that miss the point. Just watch the original trilogy again and sit this one out.",0.06823803511303513,0.49124098124098126

We waited two years to see this great Jedi that we glimpsed for 30 seconds in the end of TFA.

He fought no one (unless you consider that Skype call with Kylo Ren a fight). Just poor writing and a terrible imagination on that directors part. Leia was also a non factor.

"I might have thought ""The Force Awakens"" was slightly disappointing when I first saw it. Well, I must change my mind. 
From the unfortunate perspective of a viewer of ""The Last Jedi"", I feel obliged to reconsider my previous opinion. The first movie of this unnecessary postmodern Star Wars trilogy seems like a masterpiece if compared to the absolute tragedy of the last chapter.
Cheap humor? Incoherent dialogs? Clichés? 
What happened to Star Wars, the innovative, mindblowing, legendary franchise that made poeple dream, shiver and sigh?
Nothing more than the mere name survives.
The authentic vibe of the old trilogies is now so irremediably lost under a pile of easily sellable garbage, that not even a miraculous change in the next chapter could bring it back to life. 
Which is bitterly ironic, considering that the only purpose ""The Last Jedi"" seems to be aiming to is to live shamefully in the light of the six glorious prequels (yes, even ""The Phantom Menace"").
On a less sentimental ground, I must add that, incredibly, the plot of this new movie does not add anything new or meaningful to Chapter VII. The only substantially unexpected events (Snoke's death and Luke's poetic dissolution into the Force) are, but I am not even surprised anymore, treated without the necessary emphasis or the dramatic touch that these moments need. 
On the other hand, useless characters (I am referring to those played by Laura Dern and Benicio Del Toro) and CGI monstrosities (crystal foxes, screaming penguin/hamsters or whatever they are) spend way too much time on the screen.
And then one last, unforgivable error : Yoda.
Why did they have to use the grotesque, puppet-like figure of the Jedi master which appeared in the first trilogy, while the little green hero as portrayed in the second one was a renowned success worthy of imitation? 
There are too many questions to be answered regarding this movie, while in the past the only one was : ""when will I watch the next chapter of Star Wars?"".
Today, I don't even want to know if and when Chapter IX will be out. 
My conclusion is deeply pessimistic and personally surprising :one can undoubtedly say these last two movies were ineffective and trivial, but they did have at least a relevant effect, that is killing the most perfect science fiction saga of all time.",0.09730429292929293,0.5233459595959595

"We all know Luke. He is the heroic Jedi Knight who turned Darth Vader to the light and destroyed the Death Star. In fact, some of us may have looked up to him at some point in our lives. When we feel down, he gives us hope. When we feel like we can't win and are defeated we remember Luke destroying the Death Star when the chances we near impossible. We remember the wise Luke from Return of the Jedi, the Jedi Master. The son of Vader who is supposed to train the next generation of Jedi. I'd love to so say The Last Jedi continues his story amazingly, but unfortunately no. It kills it all. They made Luke a grumpy old man on an island that almost killed his nephew in his sleep in fear of him turning to the dark side. That sounds an awful lot like Palpatine killing Darth Plagueis doesn't it? You have to think, Luke isn't palpatine. Luke isn't pure evil. He is quite the opposite of that. It all comes down to Rian Johnson not understanding the Skywalker Legacy. It was a poor choice to hire Rian for The Last Jedi as it did cause many issues. It was revealed that Luke Skywalker actor Mark Hamill had repeatedly asked Rian to think about the fans. Selfishly Rian said that it was his movie and story, not the fans'. However, his movie was not the right story at all, and he clearly didn't understand. Back to Luke's many problems, Luke then pouts on an island saying, ""It's time for the Jedi to end."" When literally all the way through the original trilogy he was trying to restore the Jedi Order and turn his father to the light side. It completely goes against everything he stands for. Now people might say,""well how would you feel about causing the deaths of hundreds of people?"" Of course you would feel terrible, but you have to remember it's Luke Skywalker. If Leia, his sister, needed him he would almost immediately help her. She didn't even blame him for Ben's fall to the dark either! I could talk way more about the negatives, but their are some positives. The visual effects are the best out of any Star Wars film, the praetorian guard fight was cool, and the props were very well made. However the negatives clearly outweigh the positives. The humor is terrible as well and that is not how you use humor in Star Wars. Anyways, that's my review. If you like the movie then Great! But don't be toxic about it please.

"So Uncle Luke went to his nephew's bedroom during the night to hurt him... If this doesn't sound creepy I don't know what does. But the question that keeps on coming to me is why have they turned Luke into such a creep and jerk? The bedroom scene has different versions that we never understand what really happened. 
Who is Snoke? Do we ever find out who he was other than being the antagonist? No? Anybody out there would care to answer why I would be happy to see a guy chopped in half? The guy is ugly but that hardly merits death. How did Snoke not sense that Kylo was going to use the Force to kill him? He practically brags about how easy it was to ""Jedi"" Kylo's mind, pulling his strings like he was a puppet. The character is so obviously created by CGI that he might as well have been a cartoon. Snoke is only evil for the sake of being evil and when he dies I really don't feel like that the ""Force"" is relieved.
And then there is the scene where Luke milks the teats of that bizarre looking alien. I mean seriously??? Why were we subjected to that scene? We move from Luke cutting off limbs from aliens to milking them? Was that creature even sentient? Because the smile of satisfaction that it gets is disturbing to say the least. However, that scene with Mark Hamill aptly symbolizes what the producers are doing to this franchise. 
What I can't understand is if the Jedi are over or not? When Luke meets Kylo Ren in ""astro projection"" mode (this is a new Jedi power, but who cares) and tells him that the Jedi will not end with him and that there's another... The scene cuts over to Rey. But earlier Luke tells Yoda that the Jedi are over... So which is it? Was he just messing with Kylo? Is Luke just trying to hurt his nephew?
Kylo Ren is a monster, then he isn't, then he is, then he isn't... Oh how confusing! He looks like a comic book villain. Then he has a moment which seems to imply that he and Rey are going to make out. I won't be surprised to discover that Rey is his long lost twin sister. Leia is sucked out into the vacuum of space but she brings herself back onto the ship with the Force of magic (or the magic of the Force)... Man, the Force is really picky about who it wants to save.

Here's the real reason I hated this movie. So after all that happened on star killer base, she finally finds Luke skywalker. Yay right? She hands him the very weapon, the one anakin crafted during the clone wars, the one he used to slay jedi younglings and masters and all kinds creatures on Mustafar and the very weapon obiwan saved for Luke all those years, and vader ends up cutting Luke's hand off with, so he receives this lightsaber with SO MUCH STORY TO IT. And he just tosses it out behind him like it's nothing and walks away it took a very serious and thoughtful moment away for star wars fans and just. Ruined it with their corny humor. I was done with this movie at this point. Fights sucked, dialog sucked, only thing I really enjoyed in this movie was yodas scene. It was nice to see him finally again as a force ghost. But if anakin and obiwan were there in episode 7 half of this mess wouldn't have began in the first place. This movie ruined Luke skywalker for me. It ruined star wars. And don't get me started on rose. Please don't ever make a steaming of cow manure like this ever again.. this ruined the whole trilogy. Force awakens felt so much darker I don't know why if it was the massacre in the first act of episode 7 or if it was the way Abrams directed it but it was at least watchable despite how bad it was, this one, was awful.

"I watched this in the theatre, convinced myself that it was a good movie. A couple of hours after the showing, I sensed there was something not quite right about the movie. Then it was released on bluray, and I gave it another chance. Same thing happens.. I got disappointed once again,. I tried to watch it with the director's opinions and responses (after the mass criticisms from fans) in my mind, but still something doesn't feel right about the movie. I read most of the reviews here on imdb, and I have to say I agree with most of the people here that rated it low, as their opinions made sense. The funny thing is that a lot of the reviewers here on imdb that rated the movie high, do not state the actual reasons why they think its good. Probably because there is no way to defend the illogical points of the movie, other than that the director tried to go a total different route of what fans expected of the storyline. When you get over your head and try to be too creative with the storyline, this is what happens..plotholes all over the place. And I believe the people who liked the movie, might have overanalyzed it and the director's vision. In reality I do not think he intended such a deep meaning with the storyline, most of it could be coincidence. And his later explanations of intended deep meanings of the storyline might just be based on what other people overanalyzed after watching the movie. I mean, if it was that good and respected storyline from the beginning, Mark Hamill wouldn't have expressed such negative opinions during the productions.

"This story is about a greedy corporation which reduced to dust a beautiful fairy tale. I still can't believe that having so much resources Disney wasn't able to hire a good screenwriter in order to make some new, but at the same time a wholesome and well-balanced story as part of the original trilogy. JJ Abrams simply made a dumb remake with a bunch of waxworks. But what Johnson did is unacceptable piece of crap. Two and a half hours of meaningless actions that caused only new problems, instead of interesting twists we got nothing. The First Order is a shame for the Dark Side, because how can you be afraid of an old nutjob and two childish hysteriacs? Palpatine and Vader were a real evil, dangerous and horrifying, but these three? No way. In details the story is awful as well. The only good thing in this 'movie' is, certainly, CGI.

"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a mess in my opinion. While The Force Awakens isn't my favorite at all, I liked most of the plots, characters, and performances.
The Last Jedi does have the plot between Rey, Kylo, and Luke which keeps me interested in what happens next. I love that.
However, the other main plot, with the other characters being chased by the First Order, is overlong and boring imo.
Then Finn (whose been stripped from greatness to mediocrity) goes with new character Rose to Canto Bight. Anything involving Canto Bight, I hate. They have to find this guy who can get them into the First Order. They don't find that guy and instead find this other guy who eventually betrays them. So what was the point of that and saving space horses?
Along with adding terrible plots, The Last Jedi also concludes plots that were introduced in The Force Awakens. Rey never turns to the dark side, Finn vs Captain Phasma is quickly finished, Snoke is killed and is never brought up again in a good way, and Rey's past is never explored and gets worse in The Rise of Skywalker.
Also, there's annoying and unneeded porgs, Luke dies, elements are stolen from The Empire Strikes Back, new characters suck, Finn's and Poe's development are lessened, the villains besides Kylo are still underdeveloped, and the comedy is atrocious.
2.5/10. I hate this film. It feels like it's in a different trilogy than The Force Awakens. It would only get worse.",-0.06464646464646466,0.5058080808080808

There's more boldness in the Times New Roman font. This instalment has evidently, looking at aggregated scores, polarised viewers. And I can see why. In this episode, the rebels attempt to flee from The First Order and it's up to Finn to retrieve someone to help them infiltrate their primary ship. Meanwhile, Rey tries to convince Luke to help the rebels and train her in the Jedi religion. That's pretty much as grand as this chapter gets. Where is the grandeur!? Where are the stakes!? Why am I not on the edge of my seat! No matter how aesthetically pleasing the visuals are, the constant feeding of nostalgia and the inclusions of a few memorable scenes...it doesn't make a film great. This episode is weighed down by underdeveloped characters, sluggish pacing and pivotal elements that are rushed. I have no doubt in my mind that Rian Johnson's directing style was glorious, in fact the technical aspects to The Last Jedi are outstanding. Visually I cannot fault the effects that are used and also appreciated the use of puppets and animatronics, particularly the Porgs which are bound to make Disney a fortune. Various memorable scenes, such as a cruiser lightspeeding into another ship, make for some general entertainment. But, I can't shake off the fact that I was bored. It took nearly half the film's runtime to get going and become interesting. Kylo Ren is the most intriguing character with plenty of internal conflict. Adam Driver gives a perfectly good performance, full of emotion beneath his eyes. I can see it! They just didn't explore his character arc or utilise him to his maximum potential. The Force Awakens introduces us to these fascinating bubbly characters that are just utterly wasted in this. I'm uncertain about ""bold"" choices regarding Leia, Snoke and Luke...but even so, I wasn't enthralled enough to care.",0.19375542199202908,0.5229067889782177

They had this tech for thousands of years, using hyperdrive like this would be standard move and would have wound in first week.

One x-fighter could take down any death star or star killer base, no problem like this. So no need for looking for death star plans and whole rogue one is pointless.

There were so many elements that just seemed so pointless like the whole Rose and Fn story wasnt needed and was there just to fill time from an already boring story, that's not even the worst part of the film. What they did to Luke's character is the worst part, he is the hero, the hero so many people and has been for about 40 years so what they decided to do was turn this amazing hero who inspires hope into a grumpy useless man who doesn't actually help train Rey in the slightest, the only cool part he had was with that fight with Kylo but that wasnt enough to save it.",-0.08246753246753245,0.5758658008658009

"The films lack of focus from a narrative perspective is perhaps the most obvious and daunting problem posed by this mess of a film, but it is also aided by Rian Johnson's many failed attempts at humour and fan service that fall well short of the original trilogies energy. Dare I say even Attack of the Clones, possibly the most condemned Star Wars film to date, at least had structure and relevant character development. The Last Jedi however falls flat on its face time and time again throughout its unnecessarily padded runtime, with dozens of 'shocking' and 'dark' moments: quite obviously Johnson's nod toward a darker Star Wars film akin to Empire, which are so overused and rushed in setup that I myself was completely desensitised by any impending twist. 
From the off, issues with regard to story and editing were prevalent with each scene plagued by over-dramatisation and poor pacing. The very first scene featuring Paige Tico's untimely death is indicative of sequencing throughout the whole movie, with her character kicking that ladder for what felt like a million years before the remote finally fell for an unnecessarily dramatic catch. However Paige's death is just the beginning in terms of exaggerated melodrama, with 'THAT' Leia scene following not long after...",-0.04851190476190477,0.5053571428571428

"I saw this movie many months after it was released and was unaware of how it was received because I wasn't paying attention. I didn't read anything about it on purpose and didn't watch the trailers because I didn't want those to ruin it for me. I am a life-long Star Wars fan, but not one of the hard-core types (SW was my favorite set of movies and I had the toys as a kid, but grew out of it and never got into the comics or games, etc). 
Then I saw it at a friend's place several months after its release. Almost immediately, the Poe vs Hux scene set the tone for what this movie was to be, and it was not good. This movie had great visuals, but the plot and characters just sucked. I was initially in a state of confusion after watching this. 
Afterwards, I started looking online and saw a few things: apparently the actress for Rose was being harassed online (?) and how Rian Johnson was lashing out at certain fans (partially to defend her?) and partially due to his arrogance at realizing he made too many mistakes with this movie. Honestly, what I saw of him behaving online was very immature. I saw a pic of him holding a sign saying something like ""your Snoke theory sucks"". The back and forth of it all reminded me of junior high school. 
RE the Rose character: I thought the character was very annoying, particularly at the end when she ruined Finn's only good potential act in the movie (I liked Finn in TFA, but he was kind of lame in this movie). But, that, in and of itself, would not have ruined this movie entirely (and certainly doesn't justify anyone harassing the actress, obviously). 
The whole movie, when taken into context with the written statements of RJ after the fact, smells of his hubris. He wanted to make this ""his"" movie and to hell with any continuity. If he wanted to do it this way, then why not just make a goofy, comedy/sci-fi movie on its own without standing on the shoulders (and pissing on) the legend that gave it that perch in the first place? I guess that might also happen now that there are rumors of him getting his own trilogy... wow, talk about rewarding bad behavior. 
Anyway, I won't go through and document all the cringe worthy moments as there are far too many and others have done a thorough job of that. 
The main cop-out to me was the way they handled Snoke (and yes, I have read Rian Johnsons rationalizations of this, and no, I didn't have a ""fan theory""). I am not passionate enough to join the ""get Kathleen Kennedy fired"" movement, but I now no longer care about Star Wars and won't bother seeing Solo or Episode 9- and certainly won't touch RJ's coming spin-off trilogy with a 10-foot pole.
Another thing I want to add is to address the way KK, RJ, & JJ Abrams have dismissed any criticism of this film by painting all those who dislike it as racist, sexist white supremacists who fear women. First of all, my 2 sisters and wife also called this movie ""garbage"". Second thing specifically to address JJ Abrams comment about critics fearing strong women: total BS. Alien was probably my second favorite movie series growing up and even into adulthood and you won't find a stronger female (believably written, unlike Rey) character as Ripply out there. This lame deflection on the part of these executives shows their arrogance and disconnection with the common movie fans, whom they seems to have a strong level of disdain for anyway.",0.15061339790153347,0.5921630347054075
"Granted there were some new ideas in this movie, (very few!) a lot of the original George Lucas material was rehashed or recycled within this new 'money making' star wars commercialized 'SYSTEM.' In one of the climactic scenes ('revenue generators') we see kylo, Ray, and snuke can be substituted with Luke sky walker, the emperor, and Darth Vader. Ray watches through a window as her 'rebel friends' are being decimated while she is simultaneously being pressured to turn to the dark side by kylo and snuke (will she buckle under the pressure? I ask, I, a rusty tripped up 50 year old man reclining in my rocker, already having seen 'The return of the Jedi' from the 80's). Did Luke give in back then?!!!! =No But we already saw that play out, we've seen it!!. Kylo, even for the most part, rescued Ray from snuke like Darth Vader rescued Luke from the emperor; dramatic right? wrong!!). So why did Disney reuse this scene almost exactly the way George had it and why do they keep reusing everything else? Because Disney is trying to drain money from a naive star wars community; they strategically perused something they knew had 'made a killing' in the past and maximized profit margins. They've already made 3 movies in 2 years, and they will keep hanging bait in front of us until we finally deem it as rotten!

"What in the heck happened to Star Wars?
Having just now (yesterday) watched this mess, I can honestly say: ""I'm done with New Star Wars episodes."" Done, not interested any more.
Let's see if I have this straight. Our new generation of Jedi can speak with each other waaay across space? Um, Jedi masters of the past had to use holographic projections, and even then the reception was limited.
Jedi Training? Nope, not no more, I guess there's an app for that. No need to become one with the force with years of training and guidance from a Jedi Master. These days you do your own thing.
Dark side? Nope. Not no more, the Dark side of the force is about as sinister as an unopened box of cookies. Where is the unbridled relentlessness for power?
Every Jedi is omniscient. Problem is not one force wielding being good, or bad know what's really going on. Neither did I. Half time through this wreck I was asking, ""WHAT?""

Almost none of these characters come out well from this film, and some shoehorned in ones take up a ridiculous amount of plot space.

"I love Star Wars. I was born six days before the release of the original; the Saga has been part of my life. I love the characters, the story, and the imagery. I love the behind the scenes history, influence on filmmaking, and cultural impact of the films. I grew up playing with the action figures, collecting the Topps cards (with dusty, razor-sharp shards of ""gum""), eating C-3POs cereal, listening to the ""You will know it is time to turn the page when you hear Artoo-Detoo beep like this"" records, playing the Nintendo games, wearing the shirts, reading the Expanded Universe, riding Star Tours, experiencing the Renaissance of the mid '90s. Star Wars was something that defined me. 
And then I saw ""The Last Jedi"".
This movie is insulting to a loyal and invested fan base. It is blatant arrogance to proclaim ""Let the past die"" when so many like me have been dedicated supporters of a franchise that permeated so many aspects of our lives. Star Wars is inextricably part of our past. To ""let it die"" trivializes the foundation of what has allowed these films to still be made 40 years later. Further, the filmmakers defend the poor reviews by blaming the fans for not embracing the desecration of our collective past.
""The Last Jedi"" is a fever dream version of Star Wars. It negates everything that came before it, including it's immediate predecessor. While ""The Force Awakens"" was a pale imitator of the original, ""The Last Jedi"" is so unlike any other Star Wars movie. Yes, there are superficial similarities: character names, weapons, ships. Gone is the grand, overarching story with historical and mythological undertones. Gone are the universally applicable lessons of overcoming selfishness and anger through maturity and sacrifice. Instead, we are given contradictory messages that only suit the plot (arms dealers are bad, but they supply the good guys; Admiral Holdo can sacrifice herself to save the Resistance, but Finn can't because of some line about not fighting the ones we hate, but saving the ones we love).
Like ""The Force Awakens"", character arcs are destroyed - characters are unrecognizable. Luke Skywalker, beloved hero of millions, is reduced to a pathetic coward just to justify Kylo Ren. Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio are reduced to props. 
I imagine that fans like myself get movies. We understand how fickle we are; we want something new, yet love our nostalgia. We get that the older characters should make way for new ones. But not like this. This tells us to jettison everything we love without offering anything better in its place. It's the same silly hubris that Disney pulled with the old Expanded Universe (the Legends); they proclaimed it all ""non-canon"", then gave us garbage like ""Aftermath"" as replacements. Yes, most of the video games, comic books, and novels were pretty bad - but they all had their fans! Star Wars really doesn't belong to any of us! We all played with our action figures differently as we created our own adventures and interpretations of the characters.
But Rian Johnson comes along like the rich kid who has all the toys and immediately tells us what Star Wars is or isn't? 
I know this is a long, meandering review. But I hate this movie because I love Star Wars. And I refuse to let Kathleen Kennedy tell me how to play with my action figures!",0.019378787878787884,0.5027348484848485

"I saw the original trilogy in 3 different theaters; the second film at a drive-in, actually, and the third film at a theater overseas. I had both versions of the original trilogy on VHS, the prequel trilogy in DVD's, and at some point I got both trilogies in box set DVD/Blue Ray combos. I got The Force Awakens in the DVD Blue Ray combo, then Rogue One the same way. Force Awakens and Rogue One both had certain things I wished were different, but those few small things were outnumbered and outweighed by greater things which I was grateful to see and experience. Not just nostalgia, but new stuff. A workable balance of old stuff and new stuff, interconnected, to make them fit together like they belong. Force Awakens and Rogue One needed to be that, and they were. Then some astonishingly underqualified folks with zero clues as to what Star Wars is meant to be came along and took a wrecking ball to the entire point of Star Wars, destroying its foundation, and with it, its entire mythology and purpose. Force Awakens had the potential to be one of the greatest Star Wars films, IF its many questions had been answered profoundly in The Last Jedi. Not only were The Force Awakens' questions NOT answered thusly, they weren't answered at all! In fact, many of The Force Awakens' points were outright contradicted! Force Awakens was highly dependent upon Last Jedi to give it its validation, which Last Jedi failed to do, so Last Jedi took Force Awakens down with it. Wasn't there ANYONE involved who could see during the process that this was a disaster in the making? Well of course, there had to be, but they were ignored by the clueless deciders who falsely believe they know best. There was one person in particular who has been involved since the beginning and knew Star Wars almost as well as its creator, and this person knew it was all wrong, but he was pressured to shut up. But you know, he was right. We stand in support of those who gave us the right Star Wars, as much if not more, than we stand against those who gave us the wrong Star Wars. It shouldn't have happened, and there were so many ways for it to have not gone this wrongly. I'd rather have a phoned in poor effort Star Wars than one which was an intentional strong effort to destroy everything Star Wars was and should have continued to be.

I realize that 4, 5 and 6 were a novlety in so many ways that comparing with those is simply unfair so I´ll steer clear as much as I can from that.

I REALLY understand Mark Hamill's dislike regarding this one. You can sense the conflicts behind it between Mark Hamill and Rian Johnsson who should have been banned from it as well as Kathleen Kennedy. How she is still with Disney is beyond me.
There are loopholes the size of Texas in the story but that´s not the biggest problem. The essense and the feel of the franchise Lucas started is sucked into deep space.

"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return Of The Jedi, The Force Awakens, and The Mandalorian (series) it's now time for The Last Jedi. I read tons of reviews stating The Force Awakens was the worst one while for me it was the best one. The worst one to me was The Last Jedi, it's just much too long, it has an uninteresting story with a lot of unnecessary scenes, the CGI's were good but that's only normal for a Star Wars movie, certainly for a recent one. I just feel the writers didn't know what to do at one point, it was just a bad script this time. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. It's not often you see sequels getting better than the first one but with Star Wars the quality of the movies just improve every time, except for Rogue One and The Last Jedi, those I thought were of lesser quality. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and The Mandalorian, as long as the chronological order is respected.

"From the little details to the plot as a whole this movie was bad. 
My biggest complaints involve Luke, Snoke, and the Finn side-plot. The first we see of Luke he takes the lightsaber from Rey (the anticipation of which was the only thing that made me come back to watch the next Star Wars movie) and throw it over his shoulder. This is such a huge turn away from the character we knew and an insult to the fans who eagerly anticipated the conclusion of that cliffhanger. We later see that Luke attempted to murder his nephew as a child. Not a believable thing for the character of Luke to do.. He is the guy who wouldn't kill his father even when Obi-Wan and Yoda wanted him too! 
Next is Snoke. This character made no sense in The Force Awakens, but I was willing to hear an explanation of him in this film. There was none. He died in a pretty cool scene, but now we are left with an inexplicable overpowered Emperor Palpatine knockoff who doesn't fit into the existing Star Wars universe at all. 
Finn was an unnecessary character in The Force Awakens who was clearly just comic relief and to diversify the cast. In this movie it was worse. The side quest his character and Rose (random frumpy chick) go on was utterly pointless and not even entertaining. It also included the most explicit political commentary in Star Wars to date, which is ridiculous and does not bode well for the franchise. (Yes, Star Wars has always had political themes and politics has been involved in the plot, but it has been very abstract and fictitious in a simple good versus evil way.) And when Finn was about to sacrifice himself and we were all cheering because we thought that was the end of his character, he is suddenly stoped from sacrificing himself by someone else's (potential) self-sacrifice. That is such nonsense. 
Now for the less important criticisms.. 
The movie begins with a fairly comical scene involving Poe, which went too far and just became awkward in my opinion. Later in the scene bombs fell out of a ship in outer space.. I know it is sci-fi, but come on, we all know there is no gravity in space. That is one of the defining characteristics. 
The ""code cracker"" character was ridiculous. The stutter was so idiotic and he just happened to be taking a nap in their prison cell, what? 
The anti-climactic end of admiral Ackbar was a disgrace. Not to mention the silly admiral who replaced him and caused the whole pointless Finn side quest. 
The way Leia saved herself from death in outer space was silly, and pointless because the actual actress is no longer alive to act in Episode 9. ",-0.03269230769230768,0.5584706959706959

The story is bad, lazy, messy and full of huge plot holes, it isn't even worth thinking about too much as the writers obviously didn't. It feels like they had many writers not communicating well with each other go off and create their own separate set pieces designed to launch new toys, these sections are clumsily strung together into a showcase of FX. 
The effects were impressive for the most part, only what I expected though and it isn't enough to hold attention when the story is so bad and badly told, I didn't care about much of the action because I didn't care about the reasons for the action. One new creature was particularly bad FX too.
The characters are dull and forgettable, most seem to be there more to make a statement of 'diversity' etc than anything else. There's a couple of older women in it who really smashed any small sense of immersion I might of had, just bad acting and weren't convincingly competent. The general rule is: the white men are evil or weak, females or 'POC' are inherently good, for the most part anyway - it's just patronising, juvenile and very tiresome.
I think this film has been poisoned with current political trends and virtue-signalling. Making a film to please modern Feminists, Leftists and SJWs has taken priority over making a good Star Wars film and it really shows, they've gone heavy on The Force being a metaphor for millennial 'feels' too, very cringey.

It had all that nostalgia which I associated with Starwars plus awesome CGI and action sequences, even though the story was exactly ""A New Hope"". I was actually looking forward to this second instalment hoping that it would keep all the new awesome things from Force Awakens but give us a new story and not just rehash Empire.

Rian Johnson comes in and destroyed everything that was star wars. The plot is stupid and rian obviously does not know how the star wars universe works. Fuel has never been a issue now it's the core of this movie. Lazers in space follow a balistic trajectory even though it's space. The character of rose is just annoying. The whole canto bithe bit is point less and does nothing in the movie except shove in an animal abuse message. Rose who just that day lost her sister and is about to lose the group of people she calls her family and yer she absolutely needs to go on a animal rescue mission that in the end fails because they have to leave the planet and they don't take the animals with them. Even the casino security in the movie says to let the animals run for now because they know they can just easily capture them again. Del toro plays his most annoying character yet. Leia is all of a sudden a super powerful force user that can save herself from death by space yet admiral akbar is killed off in the most unrespectfull manner.

"While at first i enjoyed the movie and it had some very good scenes, the characters were completely disrespected. the much loved Luke skywalker was portrayed as a depressed old man with barely any powers and who gave up on everything. this completely took everything people loved about luke and the jedi and tossed it in the bin. people hoped that we would find out snokes back story in this movie, how he became so powerful and who he really is, there were many fan theories that actually sounded good but no, they just made snoke some guy in a golden bathrobe who gets killed before we know anything about him. admiral ackbar was killed without even a mention which just broke my heart. captain phasma who was said to be a great character was wasted again with a short scene and nothing else but a comic book, the deleted scene of her final fight would have made it a little bit better. i personally was not happy with leia's role in the movie and i hated admiral holdo and how she didn't tell anyone her plan just so fin and rose could waste our time on a pointless political SJW scene. that does not belong in a star wars movie. rose didnt need to be a character, and it was really stupid how she stopped fin from saving the resistance. kylo ren was cool before but is now just a cry baby. it really annoyed me that we saw more of rose crying for her sister who we were just introduced it that of well known and loved luke skywalker crying over the death of han solo. luke should have shown more of his force powers and been the same luke we knew from the OT. i enjoyed most of the battle on crait and snokes throne room scene(appart from him dying) but the rest of it seemed like a disrespectful parody of star wars. i also did not appriciate the hate towards the fans from lucasfilm and how people were labelled as racist or sexist just because they didnt like the movie.some of it didnt make sense and luke should not have died. i like star wars and i enjoyed this the first time i watched it but it just disrespects everything about star wars. i also hate the kathleen kennedy the force is female thing, star wars is for everyone and is not the place to show your extreme political sjw views.",0.12879807692307688,0.524775641025641

"Just as episode VII ruined the ending of VI, this film ruins the character of Luke Skywalker, at least if you consider these Disney created films as canon. Many of the core elements which were present throughout Lucas' films are again absent in Disney's third attempt at making a Star Wars film. For example formerly central characters such as C3PO and R2D2 again take a back seat, popping up only occasionally to silence fans who might criticise their absence. Similarly beloved characters Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia are again treated like garbage to make way for new characters who are not even half as interesting. Likewise, lightsaber battles are again almost non-existent despite their universal appeal and a romantic comedy's worth of humour is shoe-horned into the film at the most inappropriate of moments.
All of the mysteries which were left after episode VII were answered or brushed aside in the most lazy and uninteresting ways, leaving almost nothing worth watching to occur in the next installment. 
The film, like the last two, is a simple cash grab by Disney and a group of filmmakers who have no regard for the universe Lucas has created. It almost seems a compliment to call the film fan fiction as I struggle to believe any fan could serve up such rubbish. The highest level of canonical material is that which was created by George Lucas, Disney will tell you that their films are a continuation of his story, but in reality they are nothing but a tool for generating profit.",0.0913284632034632,0.31500077303648727

"***SPOILER FREE PART HERE***
Where do I begin? I went to the theater having read all the spoiler free reviews this movie got starting from it's release date. So my expectations were at prequel-levels of low if you know what I mean. I knew there was going to be some controversy in the movie but I was like:""Hey... if they have a backstory or motivation strong enough for me to believe, I'll maybe like it."" But oh boy I was in for a nightmare. The film started with illogical space scenes, then went to stupid story lines that took the characters from point A to point B to get something from point B only so that in the end all the effort didn't matter. There was little to no background for Luke's way of acting in this movie, I mean he had no strong motivation, which was a problem that I saw the movie had from the beginning to the end which crippled it. Characters were changing motivations like weather and talking drastic decisions just for the sake of taking them without any ramifications or logic towards the future of the franchise. And let me expand this: The movie felt like it was made by 2 types of directors: one that build great climaxes towards huge twists and another one(like 5 years old or something) that would write idiotic conclusion the the twist that let me like: ""what?"" ""how is that possible?"" and no explanation further. Basically it felt as if Ryan Johnson build those moments for huge twists and then just slapped the audience in the face with incredibly dumb resolutions. Everything was awfully wrong and felt like a ""Batman and Robin"" disaster. To conclude this: all those awesome game-changing moments from the trailer are just lies meant to drag the audience towards something but actually scr*wing them up after.",0.017788461538461555,0.600801282051282

There just wasn't any sense of menace at all in this, Kylo Ren being reduced to more of a side character with moments of telepathy.

Her character is annoying. Her story arc is pointless. What they did to Luke is unforgivable. I totally agree with Mark Hamill's anger at the direction Rian Johnson took with Luke.

"I wanted to like this movie. I saw the first super-excited reviews on twitter and thought it was going to be great...but it completely disappointed me and a lot of other star wars fans.
Force Awakens had things in it that weren't great, but it was arguably better than the prequels and gave us some great characters, new faces, and visuals.
The worst part is that so many characters act like completely different people than they did before; Rey, Poe, and Luke especially. It was needlessly grimdark and full of death. The first movie established Rey as the main character with Poe and Finn as the other mains, but this movie acted as if Kylo Ren were the main character and not the villain. it seemed like everything the first movie established, this movie changed with no reason why. I felt especially cheated because Rey felt sidelined in a movie where she is supposed to be the hero. Backstory about the Knights of Ren and Rey's past was different from that stated in Force Awakens. The jokes were awkward and in places where they often broke dramatic tension or paused in the middle of the story, rather than being worked in organically, making the movie seem like a parody of itself. So many of the lines gave me flashbacks to some of the truly awful nonsense dialogue in the prequels, especially with Hux, and some of Rey and Luke's lines were so strange I just found myself thinking, ""Did they really just say that?"" The scenes between Rey and Kylo Ren were inconsistent with each character's development in the first movie, awkward, and just made Kylo look like a creep. The whole Snoke narrative was completely wasted. I find it impossible to give this movie more than a 1 rating because although a few things made me smile, i was so confused by where the film was going and how inconsistent it was that the whole experience was like watching a really, really bad fan fiction. Carrie, Daisy, Oscar, John, Mark, and the fans deserved something so much better than whatever this was",-0.019031781226903167,0.54320029563932

"As someone who grew up with Star Wars and has an open mind about things and realizes that nothing lasts forever, this movie is an absolute pile of trash. I actually really liked The Force Awakens so this isn't an old man hates new things rant. Let me head off all the lazy defenders of this catastrophe: I don't have an issue with a female protagonist. I don't have an issue with a visually diverse cast. I have an issue with stupid plotting, stupid writing and a complete and utter failure to understand what makes Star Wars successful. It's not special effects, it's not light sabers, it's not cornball jokes, it's not space ships. What makes Star Wars special is it's simplicity of telling an epic story of good overcoming massive obstacles to defeat evil. The Last Jedi is a total violation of everything that makes Star Wars special. You have basically a checklist of marketing and identity politics concepts thrown into a space movie with no regard for plotting, structure, writing or directing. Characters make stupid and nonsensical decisions. Established characters do things that completely fly in the face of their previous portrayals. Example: Luke abandoning his friends. That's literally not Luke Skywalker. Even Mark Hamill knows this. Things happen that completely ignore the rules of the universe that have been established through 7 other films. Examples: You can't use hyperspace to run into things. Force ghosts aren't capable of altering the physical world. Spacecraft don't run out of fuel. You don't ""drop"" bombs in space. The Force does not protect you from the vacuum of space. The Millennium Falcon does not teleport. And the worst thing of all is that at the end of the movie there is nothing, I mean nothing there to bring you any kind of sense of joy or enrichment. There is nothing to excite you about another movie because The Last Jedi broke Star Wars. I saw it twice to make sure I was seeing the same things over again and not imagining it. It has taken something from me that had an big influence on my life and defiled it. It's an absolute disgrace and it absolutely broke my heart.",0.01843979663747106,0.5594126480754387

"Going into this film, I had high hopes. TFA left a lot of questions unanswered. What was produced left me appalled. This is quite honestly the worst film I have ever seen. The film starts out with two characters exchanging mom jokes. Since when did that become a thing in Star Wars? Lea apparently is now Wonder Woman. Luke's character was absolutely destroyed.

It rides along on the lore it inherited, contributing nothing while consuming everything, it uses up and destroys lore and characters, but adds nothing.

"I've been a Star Wars fan my entire life and I'm 37, and I had such great hopes when I heard Disney was gonna continue the Skywalker saga. Instead all I've got from this movie and the last is a big broken heart! They have trashed the whole thing by making these last two movies!! Just goes to show that all Disney cares about is the almighty dollar! If they truly cared about the franchise they would have kept Lucus on as consultant and went with his ideas for the continuation of the saga! Now that I've said my piece on to my review:
The Last Jedi was cinamatically a good movie. Lots of bright shiny lights and one liners for humor. Otherwise, Luke Skywalker milking a beast for blue milk!!! Really, was that necessary?? Just about lost my dinner to that scene. Then Leia flying through space using force powers she's never showed any signs of!! Give me a break! And then you go and kill Snoke without even an idea of who the heck he was or where he came from and why his force power is so strong. THENNNN, to cap it all off,... you go and kill off Luke Skywalker!!! That's the last straw!!! Even if that was ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, it shouldn't have happened until the last film, if at all! If I knew then, what I know now, I would've been very satisfied with Episode 6 being the last Star Wars movie in the Skywalker saga.",0.17981770833333333,0.4304166666666666
"Seems nobody likes The Last Jedi however still high scores in professional media. I liked it in theatre with moving chairs though. However treating one of the most iconic heroes of all time like that takes as special kind of amateurism towards filmmaking and the whole franchise. After seeing some reviews about the last Jedi on YouTube I agree that the story is realy bad and does not make sense it is that bad with so much budget. The level of political correctness is also unnecessary here, please skip it. Villains have the hair of the cartoon drawing of the royal horse of a prince (euh... princess nowadays) that is being shampooed and brushed daily while on the other hand the guy is the most terrifying dark mass murdering sadistic person in the universe. The people in charge of this franchise are just lacking the skills to create an awesome Star Wars movie.

"...only for this awful director to turn him into just a whiny old man that barely does anything.
First, the whole Finn storyline is bloated & ends up meaning nothing to the plot.
Second, the Laura Dern faux-martyr nonsense was ridiculous! If you can just kamikaze a ship hyperspace backwards into the chasing fleet, why wait until your last ship to do it?! And why not evacuate everyone but a droid first?!
Third, the final battle staged as though on a 2D tabletop rather than with aircraft capable of 3D aerial support was just stupid. And the holoprojected/astral Luke was also just stupid. At least his own damn sister would be able to feel if his true presence was there or not.
Speaking of Leah, all the extraneous long shots of Carrie Fisher's CGI visage to long overdramatic music were just so tedious.
But really that Luke Skywalker was written down to such a husk of a non-character was infuriating.
Also, the just anti-climactic word vomit of the ""truth"" about Rey's parents was awful.
Basically, the entire movie is a clumsy corporate effort meant to disengage the Jedi and The Force from the Skywalker family, in a way that destroys our memory of them so that Disney greed can make tons of other sequels about other random Jedi.
This movie is a corporate piece of trash worse than any of the prequels!

"As much as I wanted to love this movie, it utterly failed to deliver on so many levels. Disney, in all its previews, advertised the film as a serious epic focused on Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren, with no doubt some appropriate comic relief as always. What they delivered was a farce-tripping over itself with excessive and ill-timed humor such that no scene could ever be taken seriously, even ones that were intended to be. That combined with frenetically paced scene transitions, too many new characters, and wasted sub-plots (casino scenes), meant the main story and characters were left undeveloped with few burning questions answered. The main premise, equivalent to a slow motion car chase with the First Order chasing the Resistance until they run out of fuel, was absolutely ridiculous. Perhaps most unforgivable of all was the treatment of Luke Skywalker. While initially promising, his diminished role and ultimate end were insulting to his character and inconsistent with everything we know about him.

Any scene that starts to get serious, is ruined by a stupid joke - I swear, literally every time it has to end in a throwaway joke (Tarantino has mastered the technique but Rian has no idea how to pull it off, and the movie has dozens of these moments)
For me, there are three major scenes that embody what this movie is about:
1. When Luke is given his old lightsaber and he looks at it briefly, only to throw it away immediately. This shows the audience that Rian is throwing out all of previous film's work, so that he can make a standalone Star Wars film in the middle of a trilogy.
2. Princess Leia getting spaced and then reviving herself, using the force to fly through space without life-support. Which foreshadows the absurdity you're about to witness.
3. When Admiral Purple Hair doesn't tell her crew what the plan is, so that she can surprise-save-the-day by entering hyper-space to destroy an entire fleet of ships with HYPER-SPACE ITSELF.

Geez, even Episode 1 was much more entertaining than this heap of trash. Anyone who praises ""The Last Jedi"" should really get their head examined, or at least watch it one more time and think a little more carefully before praising anything this horrible. Terrible plot, terrible character development, lame and unfunny jokes, and in no way at all did it feel like a genuine Star Wars movie.

"'Star Wars Episode 8: The Last Jedi' was very different from any Star Wars film before it, in some ways good, and in some ways bad. It had an interesting story, like pretty much every other 'Star Wars' film, which isn't at all surprising. I was extremely excited walking into 'The Last Jedi', but I left kinda disappointed about certain aspects. I loved seeing the legendary Rebellion hero and Jedi Master Luke Skywalker again, but his death is the main part I was disappointed by. He is one of the most iconic characters in film history, and I feel his end should've been equally as iconic. I was on the edge of my seat when he showed up on the planet Crait to help the Resistance and him and his former student Ben Solo/Kylo Ren were about to fight. I thought it was going to be the most epic lightsaber duel of all-time, but instead it turned out Luke wasn't even there! He chose to stay on his little island and project a Force-illusion or hologram or whatever you want to call it, instead of showing up in person and facing Kylo like a man. Then he just disappeared and ""died"" like Yoda did in 'Return of the Jedi'. That really rubbed me the wrong way. Even if he knew he was gonna die, why didn't he go to Crait in person and duel Kylo Ren to buy the Resistance even MORE time to escape? Then when they were safely off-world, he could've done what Obi-Wan did in 'A New Hope': lowered his lightsaber (which technically should've been his green-bladed one instead of his blue one which had just been broken in half about a scene before), allowed Kylo to strike him with his red lightsaber, and just disappeared, leaving only his robes and lightsaber behind. That would've been an epic and iconic end for such an iconic character. Anyway, I feel like I'm ranting, so I'll move on. The space battle at the beginning was amazing, even though it didn't end well for many Resistance fighters and pilots. There were definitely a lot of deaths in this movie. Luke, Supreme Leader Snoke, Captain Phasma, Vice Admiral Holdo, Rose's sister, and Admiral Ackbar (""It's a trap!"") all died, which was very sad. I was hoping to learn more about Snoke's backstory because he was shrouded in so much mystery since The Force Awakens, but I guess he just wasn't that important. I got so excited when Kylo Ren killed Snoke because I thought he was turning good again, but it turns out he's still evil and just wanted to be Supreme Leader so he wouldn't have to take orders from anyone anymore. I guess it wouldn't have made much sense if he turned good again because then who would've been the main Force-using villain? The ensuing battle between Rey and Kylo vs. Snoke's guards was pretty cool, I just wish there would've been an actual lightsaber vs. lightsaber duel because this is actually the first Star Wars movie (aside from Rogue One) without one, which makes me kinda sad. Probably the biggest question going into 'The Last Jedi' was the mystery of Rey's parentage. It turns out her parents were just... nobodies. Drunks who sold young Rey off for drinking money or a way off Jakku or something, which was initially very disappointing to me because I really wanted her to be descended from or related to a character from the original trilogy or even the prequels. But the more I think about Rey essentially coming from nothing, the more I'm ok with it. After all, Anakin Skywalker was just a slave boy (and so was his mother), and I guess it shows fans that anyone can be a hero, no matter who you are or where you come from. Plus, it means she's free to forge her own path and make her own destiny instead of being held down by a famous bloodline. I really hope she has a double-bladed lightsaber like Darth Maul's in Episode 9, since she's proficient with a staff. The scene at the end with the little boy on Canto Bight using the Force to grab the broom and holding it like a lightsaber while wearing Rose's Resistance ring was cool because I think it symbolizes that a new generation of Jedi will rise, so the Jedi will never really ""end"" as Luke wanted. The acting from everyone was fantastic, and I think this was definitely Mark Hamill's finest performance as an older and more weary Luke. Overall, while there are some parts I didn't like, the film as a whole was solid. Not my favorite Star Wars film (that honor goes to The Force Awakens), but definitely solid, I just really wish Luke went out like more of the epic badass I know he is. I think the main, overall message of the film is that no matter how dark and dire things get, there is and always will be hope. By the way, I forgot to say my favorite part by far was Yoda's cameo. I almost cried.",0.1633807666480934,0.5047961224693898

The choreography is really bad as well, at one point they just delete a knife in the throne room fight scene I'm sure you know what I'm talking about so I won't go further. They pretty much destroy any logic that remains with lightsabers. Ben is seen turning a lightsaber on and off in less then a second. Previous installments of Star Wars have had lightsaber take several seconds to turn on and off again unless the lightsaber is malfunctioning like Kenobi's did in the clone wars when his kyber crystal had been damaged. Ben is just an annoying man child who can't do anything which is pretty pitiful for a villain. Also the force projecting thing that Luke does doesn't make any sense. Luke somehow knows that they need to stall for time and projects himself across the universe. Leia who isn't that force sensitive somehow contacts him across the universe and Luke is able to get the message? It just is using the force as a plot device and not a tool like it is. Also the floating thing? Oh come on if Jedi could float in battle this could be a major advantage so why don't they? This movie breaks so many level of canon. I say anything 15 A. B.

"First of all, i want to say that i am not a critic nor a person who knows much about film, but this movie is BAD, i mean REALLY BAD, now i also want to say that this movie's effects deserve some credit they are really good and the music is also kind of good, visually it is great, but that is what bothers me the most it looks expensive and has great effects but the story, pacing, tone, characters and reasons are dumb and badly written.
First off, the chase is dumb, i do not understand how every single ship on the first order's fleet is the same speed (wait no there ARE ships that reaches them the tie fighters, but even when they send them they only send 3, so yeah) so this is were the pacing and tone fail, we see finn wake up in some kind of water suit and walk around while it's leaking (haha) then we see Kylo-ren debating to kill his mom and struggling with the choice but eventually she ends up shot and she just pulls herself back in and poe just opens the door to the vacuum of space and nobody goes flying out? (WHAT?)
Plus that whole Canto Bight part was just padding.
Also, i do not understand wth rose was, i mean first she is loyal to the rebellion and electrify Finn but then she literally dooms everybody and tries to save him, also that whole saving Finn thing is absolutely stupid, she turns back while finn is still going forwards full speed, they are already apart by like 15 meters the last time we see an overhead view and then suddenly out of nowhere like she was John cenna she crashes into finn and saves him.
First off she would've first have to turn around and go to the right then somehow go faster than Finn, fast enough to get past him and make a 90 degree turn to smash into him, and by doing that she is killing everybody for no reason except ""love?"" (I don't think Finn was comfortable with that kiss)
I also have a couple more problems with this scene ex; most of the rebel forces are outside the blast-proof gate and are fighting the tie fighters, even tough they do not need to since even after they break through the doors it's a man size hole they go trough and a small force could've just defended it while the others escape (Instead of most of them dying and (wait a second there's no bodies anywhere?) Why?)
Plus the Holdo maneuver although amazing looking (i did mention visually it looks great) if you think about it it is just stupid, first off why hasn't anybody tried this before if it literally destroys so many ships?, Also HOW? it was already stablished that they kind off use a different dimension for hyper speed and that's why they never crash into anything, it's not just going super fast.
My big problem with this is just that this movie had so much resources (around 250 million dollars) and it still sucked.
there have been several other movies with much lower budgets that have done really well (mad max, evil dead, get out(i know it isn't as little but it's much better) ).

It has so many plot holes in it, if it was a ship it'd be at the bottom of the ocean. 80% of it's dialogue is just awful one liners. The entire plot makes no sense. The characters will say something like ""This giant door we just closed is the only way in or out of this base!"" then the next scene everyone runs or flies out of the base to fight the First Order. NO SENSE. That's just one of many examples. The movie itself is stupid as can be. While I may not have liked The Force Awakens either, at least it felt somewhat like a Star Wars movie. Speaking of which, Rian Johnson completely ignored the previous film. Everything JJ Abrams set up to further the plot was flat out ignored or deliberately dismantled. The biggest example of this is probably that Rey isn't a Skywalker. She is a nobody. In The Last Jedi, they explain her unnatural strength in the force for someone who has had zero training due to the fact that Snoke ""Force-connected"" her and Kylo Ren so that she has all of his abilities... come on.

"PROS:
Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, John Boyega, and Adam Driver are still wonderful as the new blood of this franchise. They all play rich characters that we absolutely care about. However, Mark Hamill stole the show for me. While some people disliked his performance in this film, I felt that it showed how he's seen a lot over the years that changed him.
The visuals in this film are top notch. I was surprised to find out which scenes were CG and which were practical (the stone hut destruction and the ship dropping bombs were both practical), which is a huge compliment.
The story was a mixed bag for me, but I did really liked it when it was about Rey training with Luke, as well as her having a connection with Kylo Ren. This story element was extremely fascinating, but there were enough bad elements in the story to counteract this.
The fight scene with the Praetorian guards was stunning. The action was so well choreographed, and it looked so cool.

The storyline was weak, and a lot of things that happened made no sense. I understand why many people are down about this movie, but what I really don't understand is how this still has a 7.5 rating on Imdb. Maybe some writers were paid off to give this movie high marks as some other reviewers have said. I will say the special effects weren't bad, and the actors did a pretty good job with the material they had to work with. That's why it will get a rating of 3 stars out of 10 from me.

I had the most chills when the man the whole movie is dedicated to find, finally appeared at the end of the movie.

Guessed he's disgusted by the latest installment now. I clapped hands with the other viewers when the majestic theme started playing. But i did not clap when the movie ended. I will try not to give away the plot, if you must know, other reviewers (normal users please, not those so-called critiques) have already mentioned a little too much.

Even the quiet scenes are mocking everything. Luke is milking an Elephant seal and then squirts blue milk into his mouth. Chewie is roasting a Porg while other Porgs watch in sadness (Supposed to be funny in Disney's view). This film felt like some weird acid trip. There is no story to follow, it's 2 hours and 40 minutes of pure nonsense. They ridiculed every aspect of Star Wars that we love. The Force now works like a galactic Skype to make calls between Rey and Kylo Ren. The elevator scene where Kylo Ren takes Rey to the Snoke's throne room is pure shameless ROTJ ripoff ! She is handcuffed, Snoke removes those with The Force and shows her a space battle outside the window and tells her how rebel friends will die etc. I mean it was beyond ridiculous. Like if a little kid grabbed some Star Wars toys and started playing with them. The action was pointless, way too frequent and boring like hell, just trash flying on screen and things blowing up. There is no character development, no emotional resonance that would actually make you care about the characters. There is no back story, nothing is explained, the characters are as shallow as you can imagine. The Star Wars feeling is not there at all. If a film does not take itself seriously, then how can the audience do it ? It really was like Robot Chicken Star Wars spoof or some weird Star Wars Holiday Special. At Disney they mocked everything about The Force, about Jedi philosophy and Jedi training. Suddenly everyone can use The Force because in Disney's view it's just some crap to move things around, lift people in the air or make a free intergalactic call. George Lucas put The Force into the movie to awaken some sense of spirituality in young people. Jedi knights are like samurai or daoist or buddhist monks. It takes a lifetime of discipline, hard training, acquired wisdom and the deepest commitment to become a Jedi and to use The Force. It takes Rey about one short meditation session to become a Jedi. What they decided about Luke Skywalker is a blasphemy ! It goes against all his moral values and beliefs of a true Jedi Master. ",-0.10072055137844613,0.5024279448621553

"For a Star Wars movie to be worse in 2017 than all of the prequels is pretty shocking. It's one thing to gripe with artistic decisions made by Johnson. For example, I'm not gonna score the movie low cause I think Luke's character was ruined. I'm scoring it low because that decision isn't substantiated by anything that makes logical sense. This is a running theme by the way. Stuff just happens, that on its own would be dumb anyways, but there isn't even a valid reason. Why does Holdo keep the plan secret? Why does Luke borderline murder his own nephew but wouldn't murder his father, arguably the most powerful darkside user of all time? How is Rey the most powerful force user of all time, based off of clear observations anyways? How does Snoke not detect Kylo's betrayal? Who is Snoke? Why does Leia demonstrate a tremendous feat of force capabilities only for no one to talk about or for her to use it again? This movie does not take you in any direction that means anything. The most important part is Luke's death. If you look at every character's arc from before this movie and after, nothing has happened.

"Disney and Rian Johnson took a massive force dump with 'TLJ'. Having seen this at the cinema, I was bored for the vast majority of it. The comic relief was more akin to a Marvel movie, and didn't work. The film has clearly been imbued with a feministic ideology with Rey, who seemingly can do no wrong. Princess Leia was a perfect example of a strong woman on the originals, because she could often best the brash, roguish cockiness and egotism of Hans Solo. It creates genuine character chemistry, and they were a believable couples because they were equals. The character of Rey not only is capable of best a trained pupil of the force in 'TFA', in Kylo Ten/Ben Solo, but unbelievably gets the better of Grandmaster Luke Skywalker - who isn't anything like Luke Skywalker now, purely out of character subversion, and for no other demonstrable reason - despite having zero training or even prior knowledge of Jedi, Sith, or the force in general until sometime part way through 'TFA'. In the originals, Luke Skywalker was the underdog, and that uphill struggle, the odds clearly been stacked against him, made him vulnerable, raised the stakes, and ramped up the tension. Many would still argue that Luke Skywalker was always a bit of a naff Jedi, but understandably and believably so, due to varying reasons. When a character is so perfect as Rey, there's no risk, and therefore no tangible sense of danger or tension that arises from such danger. That's only part of what is wrong with both 'TFA', and to a greater extent, 'TLJ'. At least 'TFA', despite sharing similar shortcomings, remembered to entertain. Maybe not as much as it could and should have, but a lot more than 'TLJ'.",0.19671768707482995,0.5985714285714284

"Complete and utter disappointment from this movie in the context of a Star Wars movie. As a stand alone I'd probably give it a 7/10, but I am a huge SW fan and went to see a SW movie. I entirely blame Rian Johnson for this fiasco. The man came into a saga that has been around for more than 40 years and ignored everything and everyone the fans loved and did his own thing. You just don't do that, disrespect fans like that. I've seen some ppl defending this saying it doesn't matter who Rey's parents are, or who Snoke is, anybody can do anything... Normally I would agree, but TFA has set this points up, so when the answer we get is: ""It doesn't matter"" it's normal to get p*ssed off. Instead of answers we were looking for we get a tone of new concept mostly centred around fuel. Anyone remember fuel being mentioned before in any of the 8 movies from the past 40 years? No? Neither do I... Only saving grace I can see is that this movie's failure was so complete, that the impact to the saga is minimal, nothing worth remembering really happened...

I dont have a problem with strong female characters, quite the opposite, but none exist in these films. Rey is a nobody who is magically force jesus because they need her, Leia is somehow more powerful than Luke despite not having 10 minutes of training, and Rose exists solely because a black guy wasn't a small enough minority.
The one female character they had that could've done something, was wasted in both movies. Brienne of Tarth-star was entirely ignored outside of a couple lines of dialogue that led no where and was involved in a whole 5 second fight scene.
Any scene with Kylo and rey talking through the force is just dumb, talking is fine but they get borderline physical when the force is specifically the metaphysical effecting the physical.
Nobody has been trained to use lightsabers but I'll be damned if they're not 10th degree black belt sword chop ninjas.
Rose is an awful addition who does nothing for anyone and there is no argument against it.
The few returners are treated like throwaways and garbage and the new actors dont have the talent or the names to carry a new franchise.
Snoke never needed to exist since he literally did nothing.
There is one fight scene (actual fight scene, not talk on a spaceship, talk about being trained, or talk with lightsabers in hand) that is an hour and forty-five minutes in and choreography is awful.

1. Gravity doesn't work in space
2. Jokes are fine, but not every 2 minutes
3. The Rey/Kylo/Luke story was clearly what he wanted to make, but had no idea what to do with the other characters and story
4. There is 76 tie fighters per star destroyer, why only send 3 and then worry about not being able to cover them? Especially with with the hanger full of fighters taken out.
5. No romantic chemistry was built up between Finn and Rose for the whole saving and kiss thing.
6. There is no reason to hold out telling the plan from the higher up like Poe. Also being a dick about it like that really doesn't help it
7. The holdo move completely undoes every thing in Star Wars. Yes the shot looked amazing, but is it worth undoing everything else for it? Again, this being such a selfish movie, it thinks it is.
8. The search for the 'slicer' is ridiculous. Surely someone could have written something, anything! better.

A movie that took 2.5h to tell a story that could have been told in 90 minutes, and in the process bored us to death, infuriated a large portion of the fans, and dug a grave for episode IX. The Force Awakens introduced genuinely interesting characters and set the stage for them grow in the Star Wars universe, promising what truly could have been a wonderful followup story. Instead, we got the unquestionably worst chapter in the 40+ year history of Star Wars. So for me, it's adios Star Wars.

"Almost everyone has heard of the classic franchise Star Wars. The first movie of the franchise, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, scored $786,598,007 in the box offices worldwide in 1977 (The Numbers). Even though it was the first time the world have ever seen the franchise, the fantastic characters and intriguing story brought in viewers from all over the world. The main characters of the original movies are still well known today, such as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Princess Leia. These characters were a large part of many people's childhoods. Today, however, the name of the Star Wars franchise was tarnished in the newest installment of the main star wars storyline: Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi. This movie is a disgusting addition to the original movies. Star Wars Ep. VIII: The Last Jedi soils the future of the Star Wars franchise by ruining Luke Skywalker's character, wasting the chance to use Supreme Leader Snoke as a powerful antagonist, and throwing away any chances of logically explaining Rey's sudden power.
A Grumpy Old Man
Throughout the original Star Wars trilogy, Luke Skywalker was the main protagonist and hero of the story. He often served as a role model for children of that era. However, in The Last Jedi, his reputation was decimated. For example, the film portrays Skywalker as a grumpy old man who does not want to be bothered by the trouble of helping the resistance. When Rey asks him for help, Luke repeatedly denies her, choosing to die alone on the island instead (Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi). In the past, Luke Skywalker was a protagonist whose never ending devotion and determination to the light amplified his good character and kindness. Until the end of the movie, Skywalker is rude and seemingly unintelligent in his actions and words. Even though Skywalker becomes more like his true self at the end of the movie, that is where the worst atrocity is committed.
An Unjust End
Near the end of the movie, Luke Skywalker dies from exhaustion after using the force to create a hologram to distract the first order in order to give the resistance come time to escape (Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi). Why is this so awful? Well, it makes him die in a almost cowardly way. He was not actually on the battlefield while he was fighting, so it seems like he was too scared to actually fight or he did not have enough power. A protagonist like him needs a proper send-off in a film, and this certainly did not meet the requirements. Skywalker should have gone to the battlefield, in person, and put up an honorable final stand against an overwhelming first order army that he could not fend off in his old age.
""He's Not My Luke Skywalker""
The way this film depicts Luke is truly outlandish. Even the actor who plays Luke Skywalker, Mark Hamill, stated ""He's not my Luke Skywalker. But I had to do what Rian wanted me to do because it serves the story well"" (Acuna). If the actor, himself, believes the script does not accurately display the character, then it is clear that the writers made a mistake. The way they portray Skywalker in this film is practically spitting in the faces of anyone who admired the character he once was.
Another Character Ruined
In the previous film, Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, Supreme Leader Snoke is set up to be a ruthless, all-powerful leader of the dark side and the First Order. It seemed like he would be like the Emperor from the original Star Wars trilogy. Fans of the series were wild with excitement. Who is this villain? How powerful could he truly be? However, the writers once again spat in the faces of the fans.
An Embarrassing and Unsatisfactory Defeat
In the first movie where viewers actually get to see Snoke in action, The Last Jedi, he is killed in a pathetic way. While Snoke trusts Kylo Ren to execute Rey and is sitting still with his eyes closed, Kylo blatantly shifts a lightsaber on a nearby table to face Snoke. After Kylo aims it at snoke, he activates the light saber using the force and cuts Snoke in half, who was completely taken by surprise (Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi). Despite being portrayed as an extremely powerful villain who can make insights into the force, he is killed by surprise in this foolish way. It is a horrible and unbelievable attempt at comedy as it was meant to shock fans and blow their minds. In reality, all the writers did was waste a fantastic antagonist and make fans angry because of how illogical his death was. Yet again, the writers erase an interesting possibility for the future of Star Wars.
How Does Rey Become So Powerful So Quickly?
Not only does The Last Jedi waste these two characters, but it also removes the logic of Rey's character. Rey was introduced in The Force Awakens as a sudden Jedi talent who went from being a junker to being a match for one of the most powerful force users of all time, Kylo Ren. There was no explanation as to how she was able to obtain her power so quickly. To become that powerful, one must train for years in order to harness the force like she does. The only logical solution to this problem was that Rey was a daughter of a powerful jedi from the past because the identity of her parents was shrouded in mystery. However, The Last Jedi threw that possibility away by revealing that her parents were actually just poor junkers who abandoned her as a child (Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi). Even though this reveal was meant to be seen as the theme ""anyone can be great,"" it does not fit within the boundaries of the Star Wars story. Instead, this just leaves devoted fans without any logical answer to how she suddenly became one of the strongest Jedi simply from finding a lightsaber and swinging it.
Conclusion
With that said, Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi was the most disappointing films in the history of Star wars. It obliterates the future of the series by ruining Luke Skywalker's character, wasting the chance to use Supreme Leader Snoke as a powerful antagonist, and throwing away any chances of logically explaining Rey's sudden power. At this point, devoted fans should be outraged by this defacing of the once beautiful Star Wars franchise.

The Force Awakens gave me a new hope (pun intended) when it came to a new wave of Star Wars movies. The Last Jedi pretty much put me in a headlock and kicked me in the nuts. Disney is mad with power. I'm watching this movie as I'm writing this and I just keep scoffing at it. The dialogue is so dumb, the jokes are cringe worthy, I seriously dont recognize this Luke Skywalker. I never knew him to be a pessimist. He went through the original trilogy as determined, optimistic and selfless. In this movie he is passive aggressive and self doubted. Codebreaker????? Wow what a stupid subplot. That casino city section of this movie and that little alien putting coins in BB-8 seriously made me gag a little. I thought Leia being blown into space would've been emotional and a dignified end for her. But low and behold she somehow awakens IN SPACE and floats!?! back to another ship. Rian what the are you smoking? Seriously have you seen a Star Wars movie before or are you going the way of Paul Feig and rewriting how a classic should be remade? Fin was wasted, Rey was neglected, I liked Rose but her character was a bit too preachy. Poe was the only one with passion. Luke wasn't Luke, Leia was a bit wooden and Chewie is now a double act with the porgs. I'm not looking forward to episode IX. I definately wont be watching it at the cinemas. Because by the end of this movie I dont even know what I'm anticipating. There is no cliffhanger, no real development, no questions that I'm looking for an answer to.

"This film has acquired a great amount of criticism over the past 2 years. And just about all of the main points can be summarized into one category: Illogical Subversion. Every big twist in this film, from Luke's lack of ambition for the Jedi, to Snoke's abrupt death, to the revealing of Rey's unimportant parents succeeds at surprising the audience.
Luke is a loyal Jedi master who would never throw away his identity just because of one mistake he made. But I bet you weren't expecting that.
Snoke is built up to be an all powerful being that will have a great impact on the entire trilogy. They wouldn't just kill him off for no reason in the second film of the trilogy. But I bet you weren't expecting that.
Rey has the powers of the force which means the force must be in her bloodline. It wouldn't make sense for her parents to be absolute nobodies. BUT I BET YOU WEREN'T EXPECTING THAT!
The entire film succeeds at surprising us at the expense of the logic of the Star Wars Universe, and the plot of the film. I'm sure we all would have rather accepted a predictable yet logical film than what we got.
However out of all the problems in this film, the one that makes me mad the most is Finn's death (or lack there of) at the end. Finn started in the Force Awakens killing for the first order, however in an epiphany moment decided to leave and join the resistance. He is now at the point where he is instead trying to save the resistance by fighting the First Order. It would have been a poetic and monumental death in the sequel trilogy. However, Rose just HAD to save him at the last second. Her logic for saving Finn is that ""we shouldn't fight for what we hate, but instead save what we love."" Ironically, this is EXACTLY what Finn was doing. He was saving the small amount of remaining Resistance members in the cave, but I guess Rose and Finn just needed to have a romantic endeavor even though it wasn't built up anywhere in the film. In fact Finn and Rey had romantic tension remaining from the Force Awakens, but Rian Johnson just forgot. I guess.
However there was some good in this film, but none of it overpowers the high amount of criticism contained in it.

"Disney and Rian Johnson have taken Star Wars back to a level of quality I havnt seen since Attack of the clones or The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug. Every positive aspect and mystery of the force awakens simply disregarded and swept away with nothing satisying any expectation AT ALL. Superficial and soulless. Destroying the legacy of every character we love and have grown up with. A kids movie with a bombardment of flat jokes and humour and moments that should be heartwarming and emotionally powerful played off as cheesy poorly executed fan service. This movie was like a terrible fan fiction written by a prequel fan. 3 hours watching a film where there is no progression in the overarching story of the franchise since 7 and works to negate anything interesting set up 2 years ago now. So disappointing that JJ didnt stay on to continue the same light but serious and mysterious tone of 7. Instead handed to a man who has no understanding of subtlety. Jumping the shark over and over again until those blue credits you have come to love so much roll and you are left relieved it is all over.
It feels like with the abundance of fantastic and genuinely surprising stories from the Expanded universe Brian Johnson and Disney thought looking for something so ridiculous and insulting to true star wars lovers would be the only way to create something edgy and original. WRONG!
There was so much potential here for this story and characters and now someone who has been a huge consumer and absolute fanatic from the first time he watched Star wars as a small child. I wont be interested in future installments. Frankly because there is nothing left to care about anymore besides a few boring super capable young people and a villain who probably isnt a villain for much longer.

"What a massive floating leftist piece of propaganda!
First off - 
Lucas rule #1 - George wanted a ""used"" look in this epic tale because sci fi films always had new pristine ships etc. They threw in old fighters at the end that did absolutely nothing!
#2 - (which describes the whole movie) The main plot of the movie is a slow motion escape from the bad guys. 
Really??
This was like watching the OJ Simpson chase but having to pay to watch it. 
So the bad guys can't catch them but they also can't travel light speed to get ahead of them and wait for them? Or call other ships to intersect them? 
#3 - ""HATE THE RICH"" theme invades Star Wars. ""The worst people in the universe"" are the rich people in ""Monte Carlo!""
Really? 
The SAME character later says ""We will win by protecting what we love not destroying what we hate."" This is AFTER she trashes the casino with runaway animals. 
Anyone else see the liberal double standard?
She also just stopped FN from SAVING the people he cares about!!
Makes NO sense. 
#4 - It's okay to eat fish but not chicken. Luke eats fish but fanged carnivore Chewbacca won't eat chicken because he feels bad and becomes friends with his food! This is the best friend of a well know ""scoundrel"" and has no place in a Star Wars movie where animals used to eat other animals like the snow monster and Jabba. 
Those little birds are everywhere and infesting the Millenium Falcon (which has a NEW cockpit update - see Lucas rule #1)
Luke also shows us where green milk comes from (nod to the BLUE milk in ep. 4)
#5 - Gravity in space??
Who drops gravity bombs in zero G? Not to mention ships that fall and lose speed when they run out of gas. How much gas has Voyager used getting out of our solar system?
The problem with liberals is as soon as they hear the term UFO they suddenly think they are L. Ron Hubbard!!
This was the worst Star Wars film yet and the first one I have NO desire to watch again let alone many times. 
There was nothing new, creative or exciting in this film just PC propaganda and an example of ""do nothing and lead from behind"". There is NO reason Laura Dern has to keep the plan a secret. It was funny to see her say ""Pew"" when she shot the gun but that belongs in a spoof not the franchise. 
Just total idiocy through the whole film with absolutely NO redeeming plots, characters or scenes. Two Jedi staring at each other for 10 minutes in an empty green screen room ""fighting"" is worse than all the mind control torture on the old Star Trek shows.

1. This film turns Leia into Superman - i honestly burst out laughing in the cinema when it happened, because it was so unbelievable!
2. Luke is totally out of character - how can he possibly doubt Kylo Ren, when he never lost faith in Darth Vader, and Vader was a million times more evil than Kylo Ren
3. The male-hating Vice Admiral Holdo - the most annoying and cringe worthy character ever in a Star Wars film, makes Jar Jar Binks look loveable
4. The entire Casino storyline, which ultimately was completely irrelevant to the main plot, and seems like just a ploy to make more toy merchandise
5. The complete anti-climax of Snoke, who was portrayed as this huge villain and ended up just an easy pushover

As a movie, I was disappointed that Rian tried to do both...change everything while trying to make everything the same. He failed at doing either well, somehow pandering and veering from the path that had been set for years.
Yes, had he tried to redo Empire or Return of the Jedi, it would have been to obvious but man, changing things just to tell the loyalist 'ha, fooled you, the plot lines you thought you knew I've made into parody"" seem more cruel than original. 
Twists are exciting when built up or around a central, undefinable theme, but to dislodge from the linneae course of characters, subplots and themes because he thought it would be funny (many examples of this throughout the movie) wasn't innovative or creative, just misplaced and awkward.
I was excited to share this new Star Wars saga with my kids, and now, it's lost it's luster. 
Hopefully, Hollywood will see the great potential the storyline could've had and redo this soon and try to stop the titanic from sinking, although, at this point, Disney is focused on $ and nothing else, so no one would have the strength to say, ""nope, that's not what anyone wants, let's fix this.""

Warning: One big spoiler.
 If you have loved Star Wars since its inception and haven't seen the Last Jedi don't go. Don't watch any more Star Wars sequels. Stop buying Star Wars merchandise. Disney has inverted everything Star Wars once was in order to subject a captivated audience to their politically correct, post-modernist, cultural-Marxist agenda. It has converted a story about brave Truth seekers relentlessly fighting evil into one of confused weaklings who preach ""everything's relative dude."" Star Wars has become the biggest bait and switch scam in history. You've been punked.
 Although the original Stars Wars was rich in political intrigue, great epic battles, wonderful human interest, colorful new species and amazing cultures, the heart and soul of Star Wars, the one thing that gave it lasting meaning, was Jedi mysticism. ""Luminescent you are, not this g matter"" said Master Yoda to the young disciple Luke Skywalker. At the core of Star Wars was a sacred and pure search for Truth, a rigorous discipline requiring total, lifelong, absolute faith and commitment, even celibacy. At the core was a relentless, single-minded dedication to overcoming the delusion of matter and ego-consciousness, to unifying one's soul to the omnipresent, invisible Light, to the omnipotent Energy, and to the omniscient, eternal Consciousness that envelopes and binds the universe: the Force. Such knowledge is rare, and those capable of the receptivity and discipline to attain it very few indeed. Therefore, a small priesthood, the Jedi, kept the knowledge alive and pure. For the freedom fighters of the Republic it was enough to keep the faith. ""May the Force be with you"" was their battle slogan.
 Opposed to the Jedi were the Sith. The Sith practiced classic Luciferian doctrine as explained by Darth Sidius in episode III, Revenge of the Sith. The Jedi, according to Sidius, were limited in their powers and were preventing mankind from achieving its full potential by denying it access to the powers of the Dark Side. To access those powers, one must take the exact opposite path of the Jedi. Whereas the Jedi dissolved ego, the Sith immersed themselves in it. Whereas the Jedi operated within a moral framework and were motivated by love for all that is, the Sith found their powers by escaping moral boundaries and tapping into pure hate.
 In the first Star Wars trilogy we found the young adept, Luke Skywalker, and his young band of merry freedom fighters, battling the diabolical tyranny of Sith Lord Darth Vader and the Evil Empire, controlled by the enslaving power of the Dark Side. Throughout the trilogy we saw young Luke grow from a brave and talented, yet impetuous, egotistical, overconfident novice into a full Jedi under the strict training of Master Yoda. 
 Before his maturation as a Jedi, Luke studied for years and suffered many setbacks. In his first confrontation with Darth Vader, despite his undaunted courage, he was overpowered by Vader both physically and psychologically, losing his hand in battle, and reduced to trembling in fear in the face of the dark, frightening and much more powerful figure. And yet when the triumphant Vader mercifully offered the helplessly defeated Luke joint rulership of the galaxy in the name of peace, Luke's Jedi heart and soul screamed out with no hesitation, ""I will never join you.""

I thoroughly indulged in the lore and loved Revenge of the Sith. (Seeing the emotions that Anakin goes through!) TFA was decent for me, I was genuinely interested in Snoke, and Luke's new Jedi training for a new set of Jedis also sparked my interest. I hoped I wasn't grasping at air, but I slowly started speculating about what TLJ would be about. I was certain that Snoke's origins or even perhaps a flashback showing how he seduced Kylo. I figured TLJ would show the resistance in a dire state, and Luke having to confront Snoke while Rey would confront Kylo; A dualism if you may, similar to when Order 66 is executed, and you see Padme's emotional release along with Anakin's. I was hopeful to see how Maz Kenata (definitely spelled wrong) obtained Luke's light saber, since it was directly mentioned.

I get what Rian Johnson was trying to do here, but not to the expense of previously well known and established characters like Luke and Leia. Underwhelming, disappointing and useless sequel to The Force Awakens. There, a new storyline was built and by the end of this movie we're in the same situation, minus some characters. The plot didn't advance; it's like the director made his solo take in the Star Wars universe in the middle of a trilogy. Daisy Ridley acts better here, compared to TFA, Carrie Fisher gives her second best performance in this universe, after The Empire Strikes Back, and Hamill brings his A game for this one. But in a story that doesn't understand its lore and previously established movies, nothing matters in the end. SW became SJW, with little care to a rich history and apparently only interested to please Di$$-ney and Kathleen's needs for diversity.

"I took my father to see this when it came out in theaters. After the movie, I told him that I thought it was my second favorite after Empire. My dad, who raised me on these movies, who has seen each of them when they first released in theaters dating all the way back to 1977, who has seen each of these movies almost as many times as I have, said ""Nah, I think this might've actually been my favorite.""
I just watched this movie again for maybe the fourth or fifth time and I still love it. I think this was honestly my favorite of Mark Hamill's performances as Luke, because he shows so much range. He's a very tortured character, angry at himself, angry at the Jedi, angry at the Sith, and angry at the Force. In one brief moment of weakness, fearing the potential of the darkness in his nephew, fearing that he wouldn't be able to be the mentor Ben needed (the same fear he showed in Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire, mind you), he made a mistake, because of course, not even Luke Skywalker is perfect, and that mistake cost him the soul of the son of his sister and his best friend. Without giving spoilers, Luke's arc takes him from the part of a reclusive curmudgeon, reminiscent of what we saw from Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back, and leads him to be the hero and the face of hope that the Resistance needs when he utterly humiliates Kylo Ren in front of the entire First Order and the remains of the Resistance.
The only real issue I have with the movie is that I feel the Canto Bight sequence is too preachy for my taste, as I just watch movies to have a good time - not to be given a sermon. But even that sequence has merits going for it, like that little drunk alien shoving tokens into BB-8 (that alien is played by Mark Hamill, by the way). Rose is adorable, and the fathiers are cute and the practical effects used to create them in the stable are flawless.
My favorite part of the movie is the whole last half hour that takes place on the planet Crait. The imagery of the asymmetrical speeders skating on the dusty surface, kicking up the bright red salt underneath is an incredible, unforgettable image. And as mentioned before, that one-on-one final confrontation is so satisfying, capped with that ""See you around, kid.""",0.1729575163398693,0.6129084967320262

And after watching it again a few hours ago I wasn't left angry or disappointed or even happy, I was left with tears in my eyes. It does have many problems, but with its message of choosing your own path and it's character changes with Luke for example. I can say that this film is possibly the best film in the entire series (well next to Empire).",0.1131578947368421,0.5592105263157895

"Once again the powerful but generally incompetent First Order threatens galactic peace. A couple of super-weapons are trotted out (an excellent ""Dreadnaught"" class starship and a death-star-based battering ram), which either don't manage to fire in time or are somewhat uneventful when they do fire. Legendary Jedi Luke Skywalker is found and sincere attempts are made to recruit him to rejoin the rebellion against the First Order (as personified by Darth Vader wannabee Kylo Ren (nee Ben Solo; Adam Driver)). After many heroic adventures and 'surprise twists', the rebellion lives on for another sequel. Weakly plotted and poorly written, The Last Jedi is an insipid entry into the third generation of the Star Wars franchise. Writer/director Rian Johnson succumbs to the lazy trick of allowing the ""Force"" to do whatever would be convenient for the plot (surprise!: Force-endowed people are able survive (and fly around in) the cold vacuum of space without any protection), or indiscriminately tossing in new technologies (e.g. Rebel cruisers conveniently have shields that seem to be lacking in the Imperial fleet (or any other ship in the Star Wars universe to date)). The latter example is particularly egregious as it allows for the tedious, O.J.-like slow-chase of Leia's ship while uninteresting secondary characters take a side trip to a casino planet (a ridiculous and unnecessary sub-plot, even by Jar Jar Binks standards). 
""The Last Jedi"" contains no shortage of plot holes and silly cartoon physics that IMDB reviewers (many especially unkind) have pointed out but to me the most glaring is the pointless death of gruff-but-lovable purple haired Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern). She heroically elects to stay on the doomed cruiser as, she maintains, someone needs to fly the thing to fool their pursuers. Flying a star cruiser seems to mostly involve looking out the window, mostly, and when flying is unexpectedly required, the trailing First Order captain assumes that the ship is under computer control anyway. The scene that follows is spectacular to watch but only goes to prove that the training the First Order Space Navy is as lacking as was that of the old Imperial Storm Troopers. 
In addition to the weak story, most of the new generation of characters are simple, predictable 2D cut-outs that I (and others I suspect) care not as to whether they live or die (truth be told, I was quite disappointed to see Rose in the infirmary, having really hoped that she'd given her life for the rebellion). 
In summary: similar to a lot of recent CGI-based blockbusters, ""The Last Jedi"" is a slackly-plotted spectacular: a second-rate movie encased in first-rate visuals. Whether the current crop of Disney Star Wars films will squander the legacy of the now 40-year old original or transfer the magic to a new generation is yet to be seen. I'd bet on the former, but as my generation of fans is an aging breed who (I assume) no longer buy a lot of SW branded stuff, I doubt that the imperial 'House of the Mouse' much cares what I think.",0.1296385991058122,0.5521165992477466

"I have seen many films in my life. Some are boring (so I start to doze off in the cinema). Some are predictable but still perfectly good fun to watch. Some movies turned out to beyond my highest expectations.
The first time I went to a cinema was when my dad took me and my nine year old brother to see a re-run of star wars and empire strikes back (double bill). I had never been so excited after seeing these films. Everything about theses films just blew my ten year old mind. The story, the music, the special effects, I was totally wrapped up on the whole Star Wars universe it was one of the truly magical magical memories I have from my childhood. I remember that day well because it had such a big impact on me.
Fast forward 35 years the the latest Star Wars installmet 'Last Jedi' is the closest I've come to walking out of a cinema in my life. There have seen many bad films including just about all of the Lucas prequel trilogy, the phantom menace and what not. Those films were not good but they were watchable. The force awakens was not bad at all and it purported to set up this trilogy nicely. The problem is the last Jedi was not only boring, full of plot holes with a rubbish script, and (lets be honest) mostly rubbish acting. All theses things are manageable and even forgivable. What made this movie so bad was that I found it offensive. I am not asking for the film maker to make me feel ten years old again, I only want an honest attempt at the next episode.
It felt like Disney, Rian Johnson, Abrams, and everyone else involved was having a joke at my expense. I felt humiliated. I'm can accept being bored or watching a flawed movie if its an honest attempt. The Lucas prequels were poor but they were his attempt to tell a story. The last Jedi felt like it was dishonest from the start: I felt like I had paid money to see not just a bad attempt but the deliberate destruction of a beloved franchise I have followed most of my life.
I won't watch start wars again. The original Star Wars trilogy is good enough for me, I'll settle for that.",0.09052197802197805,0.5379120879120879
"The last Jedi ist the worst star wars experience i've ever had. After the force awakens there were alot of open questions and i had a lot of hope for the next movie. But Star Wars 8 was a big disappointment. The good storylines created in Part 7 got ignored in the last jedi.
Alot of really unfunny jokes like the Iron in the Base of the First Order... wtf guys?! The little crappy animals which are only good for merchandising or the your mother - joke ...
Earlier Star Wars did not try to make bad jokes ... the jokes were more decent... they came in the situtions and the dialogues.
Luke Skywalker.... maybe The Last Jedi was the best performance from Mark Hamill... but he really can not change a bad story. Luke Skywalker... the man who did NEVER lost the hope in his father Darth Vader ... want to kill his nephew while he is sleeping????? Because there COULD BE darknes in his soul? Please guys...

I hate how they destroy the Power of the Force by showing the ""magic"" in front of everyone in the theatre. The Force is so meaningful to Star Wars. It's powerful but not weird like that. I'm telling about Princess Leia scene. :(

"Bad writing, off humour, lack of a proper saber duel, no character development with Rey, weird usage of Yoda, injustice done to Lukes character. The whole film just felt void of life. As such an avid star wars fan it's difficult to sit back and watch as my favourite franchise gets butchered. I just hope we see some improvement with Solo and Episode 9, I don't want to see sw go to ruin.
Please get more competent people to work on future episodes and bring the quality of star wars closer to something like the avengers infinity war or guardians of the galaxy.",-0.022727272727272707,0.5416666666666666

"Ever since I was a small child, I was fascinated with Star Wars. I vividly remember the first time I saw the movies in the cinema when they got a rerun in 1997. I was and still am in love with Star Wars. I grew up with it, watched everything, read the books, played the games and collected the toys. To me, Star Wars is more than just a movie it is my Childhood and still a very important part of my life.
When I first heard the announcement that Disney bought the rights to Star Wars and more movies were on the way, I was excited for new possibilities. The Force Awakens, despite its flaws and similarities felt like a Star Wars movie and played homage to the older movies. J.J. Abrams managed to create a successful entry point to a new trilogy with likeable and complex characters, charm and wit. It was the start of something great, the necessary similarities set the boundaries for a successful continuation. 
The first part in the trilogy left me wondering what would happen next, who are Rey's parents, how could Supreme Leader Snoke seize power. I was excited for the future. Fast forward to the current day, I have seen the movie twice now and I am heartbroken and confused as to how it could go so wrong. 
The movie starts with a dire situation for the Resistance their ships have been found and are faced with superior numbers from the First Order. The foolish but likeable character Poe Dameron faces off with a Dreadnought to gain enough time for the Resistance to escape. This already starts off one of my major gripes about this movie. The dialogues and the forced slapstick humor just does not fit the grandeur of this movie. The conversation between General Hux and Poe is laughable, but not in a good way. The joke at the expense of Hux discounts the seriousness of the situation and this slapstick runs like a common thread throughout the movie. The Last Jedi resembles other Disney projects such as the Marvel Franchise in this regard; every action has to be commentated with a joke, because of fear that the viewers could lose interest in the subpar storylines. 
While the battle is developing, the Resistance manages to attack the Dreadnought with their Bomber Squadron and destroying it in the process. Unfortunately, nobody told Director Rian Johnson, that Bombs should be floating in space, but gravity is ignored in this instance.
In the subsequent battle, Kylo Ren and two Tie-Fighters destroy the bridge of the main Battleship of the Resistance. The whole leadership of the Resistance, including Admiral Ackbar, is wiped out, except for Leia that is hovering in through space in zero gravity. Leia then escapes death by using the force to fly through space with her best Mary Poppins imitation to get back to the Battleship, in what can only be described as the most unreasonable and unrealistic moment of the whole franchise. While she has shown that she is force sensitive in the past, this felt like a cheap and unnecessary way to advance the plot. It also doesn't have any influence on the advancement of the overall plot whether she lives or dies, but would have been a good opportunity to send of the late Carrie Fisher.
In a plan to escape from the grasp of the First Order, Finn and Rose Tico, a crewmember of the Resistance, set forth on a journey to the planet Canto Bight in order to search for a code cracker that will insure the Resistance a safe escape. The whole scene felt more like it descended from the Harry Potter franchise than Star Wars, gone are familiar alien races and they get replaced by money loving caricatures of society. The whole Plot felt like it tried to lecture the audience and Finn and Rose had no on screen chemistry. This part could have been cut from the movie and would have made it a stronger movie overall.
At the same time, Rey finally meets Luke Skywalker on the Island, where the first Jedi once lived. We get to know more about the reasons why Luke decided to live on this desolate island. This storyline overall felt authentic, but has one glaring issue that goes against everything the Star Wars franchise stands for, the creation of Kylo Ren at the hands of Luke Skywalker. Fearing the imminent turn to the dark side of Ben Solo, Luke raises his Lightsaber to strike down a sleeping Kylo Ren. Luke Skywalker, the most powerful Jedi that brought balance to the force, gives up hope to kill the Son of his best friend Han Solo and Leia Organa, his own sister, despite infringing on the very principle that defines a Jedi. This is an unreasonable character trait that does not fit the Luke Skywalker that everyone grew to love from the original trilogy. This part of the story had the same weaknesses that plagued the rest of the movie; important scenes were ruined with slapstick humor that was not fitting the tone of the situation. 
Later on, Rey confronts Snoke and Kylo Ren on their main Ship and ensuing scenes are very well orchestrated. Still, Supreme Leader Snoke feels like a missed opportunity. We do not get to know how Snoke obtained his position or even who he really is. He is depicted as an almost almighty deity that feels untouchable, but his hubris is ultimately his downfall. The Choreography and visual effects are top notch and the movie starts to drastically pick up from the moment Rey steps food on the First Order Ship.
Finn and Roses plan to save the Resistance fails, but BB8, that seems like an unstoppable killing machine in this movie, safes them once more whilst controlling an AT-ST, after single handedly beating multiple guards back on Canto Bight. The mutiny subplot between General Holdo and Poe is going on at the same time and their performances and believable character traits make this one of the highlights of the movie. While I liked this subplot, the whole problem could have been entirely eradicated, if Poe and Holdo talked about their plans. The scene ends with Holdo sacrificing herself in order to save the last surviving escape pods, by ramming the Resistance Ship into the First Order Ship, but only doing so, after basically killing of the vast majority of the Resistance Ships. The magnitude of the exploding First Order Ship gets reduced again by slapstick humor and dialogue that feels completely out of place. Captain Phasma, an intriguing character from the Force Awakens, that did not see nearly enough screen time, does not get used to the full potential and finds death without ever achieving anything meaningful.
The final battle happens on the salt planet Crait, the Resistance surrounded by the First Order and Finn and the others go on the offense with some speeder like ships. Finn is ready to sacrifice himself in order for the success of the Resistance, but gets stopped at the last second by Rose, that selfishly decided she was more important than the chance of overall survival, despite highlighting over the movie, that solidarity and believe in the Resistance is crucial.
Luke Skywalker appears as an Illusion, unknowingly to Kylo Ren and manages to buy enough time to get the Resistance to safety. He finally manages to find peace and balance with the force and dies in the process. 
Overall, the Soundtrack, the Sound effects and the Visual effects are stunning. The action is great and if this is enough for the average viewer to be entertained, this movie can be ideal. The problems start with the implausible and the shoddy dialogue and leave much to be desired. Some characters get fleshed out, while others seem to be forgotten. The chemistry between Finn and Rose is simply not there and the movie would have been better without the whole love story in it. I can´t imagine that hardcore fans of Star Wars can be happy with what was achieved by Rian Johnson, he does not seem to be the right guy to lead the next trilogy. Unfortunately the positive aspects do not manage to redeem the glaring issues of this long awaited second part in the sequel trilogy.

Because I don't follow star wars as closely as others, I can't comment on how this 'ruins the force' or 'ruins Luke Skywalker' as I've seen others note. However, I found this 2h and 35 minute film rather painful, whether it be the way comedy is rammed into what I assume was originally a darker story about failure and mistakes, or how supposedly 'good-guy' characters are awfully unlikeable. One noteworthy example I found was the rebel general (Holdo) for much of the film. Her insistence on hiding information from her crew was thoroughly unlikeable, and I can't say I shed a tear for her death.

So in Cobra Kai both generations are EQUALLY important. 
In contrast in SW, the old characters are practically irrelevant to the story, they used the old characters in little roles, something like longer cameos, the didn't create a new story for the old characters, they forced the focus only in the new actors, and even worst: they had the awful idea of tell the same old story with the new characters, using in the way, the old characters as steps on a ladder.

The Last Jedi was weak and stupid.

The magical universe full of exotic, as well as very human, characters, an epic battle of good against evil, thrilling space battle scenes, etc. ""The Force Awakens"" rekindled my interest, mainly because of the new, young characters: Rey, Kyle, Finn and Poe. However, the ""The Last Jedi"" was poorly written from start to finish. The characters and conflicts are predictable, repetitive, flat. It's the same storyline over and over again. Star cameos and corny jokes don't make up for good writing. There were also too many obvious deus ex machina plot twists, like a very wooden Princess Leia floating through space to be miraculously saved (and unscarred) after an explosion. If the First Order/Empire (is there any real distinction?) is going to kill Leia, then let them do it, and let it be realistic. Even Yoda's crotchety ghost appearing seemed like a boring cliche.

If these rules suddenly shift or are thrown out of the window, it ruins the believability and disrespects its viewers. This is why the Matrix 2 and 3 for example were absolutely atrocious sequels to an excellent original.

"Okay so, I have been letting this ruminate in my thoughts since the movie came out. I watched it twice, and disliked it both times. I hated it so much the first time I watched it that I sat for about half of the movie, with my arms crossed just waiting for it to be over (probably way too overdramatic but oh well) Let's get to the brass tax here. I am a huge film buff. So when I look at movies and critique them, I look at them from technical elements, to the structure and and all the other great stuff that makes a good film. This movie is not that. I love Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back is not only the best Star Wars film, but (in my opinion) one of the best films ever made. So watching this movie I had both my love of film and Star Wars going at the same time. The Star Wars fan in me really dislikes this movies for several reasons. Number One, because Luke says that everyone can use the Force, and that you don't have to be special to use it, VASTLY undermines his story in the OT. The whole point of him understanding how to use the Force is so critical to the story. His main motivation to leave Tatooine is so he can become a Jedi. His story from a literary standpoint is called ""The Heroes Journey"" which is so vital to his character. This movie takes his whole story and throws it out the window with that one line. This bothered me so badly. Luke Skywalker is one of my favorite movie characters of all time. His story is so perfectly crafted in those first films. I could write a book on how great his story is. Anyway, this also sweeps everything Yoda taught him under the rug. Yoda says ""Life creates it, makes it grow. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter."" The Force is bigger than anyone in the universe, that's why only certain people can tap into it. THATS THE POINT. ITS A CALL TO ACTION, TO MOTIVATE THE CHARACTERS INTO ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING WITH THEIR LIVES. So the Last Jedi is telling me now that ANYONE can use it?? What??? Secondly, I hate how this just doesn't have almost any payoffs from the Force Awakens. I don't necessarily care that Snokes true identity is never revealed, I liked that! It would have been dumb to keep him anyway because he would have just been another Palpatine. I liked that they just said that Rey's parents were just random junkers. That makes her even more of an anomaly because she has no genetic connection to the Force, which would have made it even cooler that she can control it and made her special. But they ruined that now but saying anyone can use it. There's so much wasted opportunity in this movie. Anyway, my last point (before this gets too long, because I could go on for awhile) they should have had Rey and Kylo become a team. They could take down the First Order that way and completely ridden it of its existence in the universe. But no. They have to have a big fight scene on a random planet somewhere a half and hour after the movie should have ended. I can say I did like some things about the film. There's no denying that this film has a beautiful look to it. The cinematography is excellent! I liked how the Throne Room looked and that scene was great. I liked the chemistry between Finn and Rose. I liked Rose until she made the dumbest decision ever at the end. The structure of this movie is a mess though. Nobody accomplishes anything. The editing was weird, and every single piece of comedy fell flat for me, except for one in the beginning with C-3P0.

"If we look at The Last Jedi detached from our feelings on Star Wars and the characters, we are still left with a bad movie. It is a poorly executed film on all levels. The plot is rushed and jumbled and there were multiple occurrences where the movie felt that it was at its climax, but it kept pushing on. In many ways, I felt like I was watching three or four movies hastily pushed into one. The timeline of the movie is confusing as we have the plot with the Resistance fighters and the First Order occurring in the span of 18 hours, but these scenes are intercut with Rey and Luke's interactions, which clearly take place over several days. When we take into account Rey and Ren's force communications, the timeline does not line up. Rey has much more time in her story than the Resistance fighters do, but the movie tries to make it appear like the events are occurring simultaneously. Moreover, The Last Jedi takes place practically immediately after the events of The Force Awakens, but there is no explanation as to how the First Order regrouped so quickly after the destruction of the Starkiller Base or how Hux, Phasma, and Kylo Ren managed to survive the destruction of the base, as the audience never saw them leave the base in The Force Awakens. While Empire Strikes Back places years in between the events of the preceding movie and itself, The Last Jedi forgoes that and ends up leaving many loose ends left loose. 
The script is bad. The dialogue is forced and cheesy and feels genuinely out of place from what Star Wars movies have provided in the past. The editing borders on amateur. The special effects are a hot mess from hell. Characters move through the air in ways never shown before in Star Wars and it does not work. It looks cheap, it looks like a parody. 
The Last Jedi is bad as a movie, not just as a Star Wars movie. As a Star Wars fan, I felt physically ill watching the film. I nearly walked out several times, but stuck around hoping that I would find some small reward for my suffering. I did not. I was pushed to the ground and kicked repeatedly in the stomach by this movie as a fan. As a film student, I was shocked by how Disney and Lucasfilm could allow a movie to be so poorly executed.",-0.11519928484214197,0.427418018489447

"Once more we have a movie that has too many convient coincidences that allow the protagonists to succeed whilst being the purer than driven snow good guys. Far too often you see main characters face situations where they conveniently get out of them with skills they haven't developed and have no reason to have. 'The Force' seems to have become a convenient tool for deus ex machinas. The film also has a few moments where it pretends to suggest moral ambiguity, but that turns out to be a red herring as it doesn't even get explored and the movie largely promotes the heroes as the unimpeachable good guys.

"Don't get me wrong - I love Rey, Fin and Po, but the incredibly tacky bar scenes, smarmy stuffed animals, overall bad writing and endless repetitious plot elements need to be blasted by the nearest Death Star as soon as it is charged and ready. The franchise is now officially in a zombie mode that sucks the soul out of every new Star Wars film before the opening crawl has faded. We need to demand the franchise be allowed to mature and become leaner hopefully strangling as much of the Lucasonian kitsch as possible. I personally think it's time for a darker Star Wars that still holds to the light even if that requires walking a tightrope between what was and what could be - the same tightrope they fell from when making Blade Runner 2049.

"I am giving this movie 7.4 out of 10 stars but I kind of want to give it 6 out of 10 stars. The film looks great, and OMG the space battles are freaking awesome and.. that is about it. This is a spoiler free review so I'm going to try my best here. The acting is a mixed bag. Some of the actors are brilliant and others are sort of just there; but I'm not sure it is the actor's fault or if the fault belongs to the fact the story doesn't make you care or connect with some of the characters. It is hard to explain without spoiling things. The movie starts out great however the middle drags like a mother thanks to a subplot which is just meh. There are major things that happen, major things that are discovered and I am almost tempted to watch the film again just to see if eliminating the shock factors deflates the film even more when it comes to plot. Here is the thing, I am just going to come out and say it; I think the current trilogy (and extended SW universe) has no direction at all and each film they put out changes based on fan reaction. Say what you want about the prequels, at least they had a strong core story (Episode 1 is weak, Episode 2 is one of the worst films ever made; just so you know I am not a prequel fanboy). These new films feel like they have conveniently gelatinous core elements holding them together which are expendable based on viewer reaction. For example, if fans go completely insane and demand Episode 9 be a romantic French comedy shot in black and white - we are going to get just that. There is no backbone. Story wise this film is a bit of a jellyfish.",0.15040584415584418,0.5473845598845599

"After watching Star Wars VII, The Force Awakens (TFA), I actually had a new hope (pun intended) for the Star Wars franchise. It was fun and exciting, it generally respected the original characters, it introduced new characters, and yes, the old characters was certainly gracefully giving way to the new characters. I thought it was a great way to start the next trilogy. So I was hoping that Star Wars VIII, The Last Jedi (TLJ), would now cement a new set of long-lasting, memorable characters in the guise of Kylo, Rey, Finn, Poe and even the new ""Emperor"" Snoke. Great scott, I was so wrong. What in the world was that mess all about? The Last Jedi was so crammed with politically correct ideology (all men are stupid and degenerate, all women are clever and enlightened). Characters like Poe that showed so much hope in TFA, even Snokes showed some weight at the beginning of TLJ, and even Luke Skywalker himself, but they ALL completely degenerated into nobodies in TLJ. And oh my goodness, the whole claptrap ideology about women being the enlightened and evolved ones and men being the old patriarchy and degenerating into dumb monkeys is so obvious it made me nauseous.

"First watched this at the cinema just before Xmas 2017. My overall feeling when walking out if the cinema was , and I can't believe that I'm saying this, heartbroken. I'm 38 years old and naturally Star Wars WAS my childhood. I'm not a hard core fan, I can't name every character to ever appear in the film's nor do I hoarde memorabilia around the house. I tolerated the prequels mostly, just happy at the time that we were getting a star wars movie. The Force Awakens gave me everything I ever wanted in a sequel. Absolutey crushed it as a film. I guess it was foolish to think the last jedi could do a 'empire' and match or even surpass the previous film. I don't buy the directors comments about how he had to go In this direction for the sake of the franchise. That is true for most franchises but not this one. Star wars shouldnt be compared to the marvel films, star trek etc. JJ Abrams understands this . It's arrogant and disrespectful to treat it any other way. Parts of the film were ok, too much reminded me of the unessesary set pieces of the prequels. Nobody is impressed anymore by CGI, George Lucas already wowed the world with it and it's not going to happen again. Story wise it just is a big let down. Such a waste for Mark Hamill and Luke Skywalker as a character. I mean it's Luke Skywalker! Can't believe I've waited over 30 years for him to return and he's just been demoted to a grumpy old man. The best part was the flashback of him and that lasted less than a minute. Even the final hurrah for him, I feel , was added as a compromise, Probably ordered by LucasFilm to just give us a glimpse of what could have been. The dialogue really got on my nerves. Too much attempt at comedy that just sounded like a pale Tony Stark impression. Star Wars is set a long time ago in a galaxy far far away and that is exactly where it should stay. The director should have remembered that and not tried to panda to current trends in the movies. Overall I'm just sad that it was not a good film. Star Wars deserves better and hopefully JJ Abrams can hit it out of the park with Episode 9.",0.1277261396011396,0.43349715099715097

In this garbage pile of a film, they don't even keep their own rules! In one ridiculous scene space bombers lumber through the vacuum of space like heavy laden WWII bombers on a bombing run over Germany, as fighter escorts are shot out of the sky? Space? And fall down to the ground? Ship? - onto which they crash and burn. ""Bomb bay doors"" open and drop bombs which fall down onto the ship, as though there's gravity? People wearing basically the exact WWII bomber crew outfits (as if technology and battle strategy remains the same as it did in the 1940s) don't get sucked out of their ships when they open the bomb bay doors...yet moments later, Leia gets sucked out of her command ship as though there's some maniacal 2 year old flipping a physics switch on and off repeatedly just to mess with everybody.

"Where do you start, OK past, present and future.
Past, The original trilogy was fantastic, not because of state of the art special effects but the story was built around characters and their interactions and friendships/romance that drew you in and made you invest emotionally in them.
R2D2 and C3PO Han and Luke, Luke and Ben/Yoda Leia and Han Chewie and Han.
Small thing when the Jawas capture R2D2 in the first film and he/she falls over every single person in the audience went ahhhhh no massive special effects dialogue or space battles just good music and writing the scene.
The interplay between characters and humour made you believe they actually liked each other.
Present, Mary Sue Rey who can fly a spaceship with no training, swim when she lives on a desert planet, can hold her own after just picking up a LS, she did not earn or learn anything.
The interactions between characters is so awkward, I don't know how the movie was shot but you would think perhaps they were jumping from scene to scene or it may have been the editing as there seems to be no flow to it just one level, flat.
I wont go into the plot and stupid side plot as a 10 year old could have written better on a cornflakes box so many holes and inconsistencies and everyone behaving out of character, I wouldn't let these generals run a tap let alone a resistance.
Future, For Star Wars I can't see Solo doing that well or the next full blown Star Wars as I think they have disenfranchised a high proportion of their fan base.
I certainly wont be investing any time or money watching them or buying the DVD for this one.

"I came back somewhat disappointed from the movie. 
The story itself is quite OK, but there are really scene's where I was thinking ""WTF?""
Thinking about the scene were Leia ""floats"" in space to go back to her spaceship (or when she ""welds"" the door open during the mutiny).
The part where the rebel ship ""cuts"" the spaceship from Snoke (that is like 10 times bigger?) in two, and 99,99% of the stormtroopers dies except captain Phasma, Finn & his Chinese buddy. Even if I have to say this scene was pretty ""wow"", having no sound for about 5 seconds and afterwards a huge bang.
Also these stupid jokes should not be included in a Star Wars movie imho, I don't know if this is due to the Disney influence but doesn't fit for me.
Also these little ""pinguins / birds"" like are at the end with Chewbacca in the Falcon is probably a nice marketing character that will sell as hell in a plush doll.
Special FX are of course stunning, the location of the last fight scene is also very nice, same with the one of the battle with Rey & Kylo Ren with the burning cloth falling down in pieces.
I won't say it's a bad movie, but it's just not ""epic"" enough I think to be a Star Wars movie, I preferred Rogue One for instance to this one.",0.022929159318048217,0.5423574368018813

"First off everyone is wondering how this movie tile got 7.7 out of 10 stars now down to 7.4 stars which is still way to many stars for this title and how all the critics seem to say this is one of the best star wars created yet. Well it all comes down to money Disney paid 2 billion dollars to get this franchise there is no way they are going to lose money on this or break even that is not a profitable business. Also Disney needs to keep making money on this title after it gets old an by it having a very low rating or getting negative reviews by all the critics a new comer to the franchise might be discourage and not want to waste the time to watch it or buy it. This is disappointing me that IMDB a trusted site of mine would sell out a long with the critics but sometimes that is what you got to do to stay in the business. Now the problem is that star wars was a great fantasy world with a very interesting story and something new in each episode created (even star wars episodes 1-3 in my opinion deserve 8 stars as well). This series has flopped because Disney is as stated above in the business to make money an they do that very well but normally the mvoies they make are cartoon movies geared at the younger generation with the intent to sell toys or family orientated like Mary Popins that parents can take their kids to. This is why Disney making the new star wars was a bad idea star wars was not made to sell a bunch of junk to little kids or band wagon fanboys it was a movie for adults who liked the fantasy world and others getting into the fantasy world. Even though Disney has trashed star wars they are genius for making JJ. Abrams who is one of the worst writers and directors of our time to headline this movie because that is exactly what he does sells junk to people who do not understand good movies. An if you don't think JJ. Abrams had a hand in The Last Jedi you would be wrong this movie stinks of him watch some of his other movies if you can sit through them and than re watch this movie again if you can sit through it. Although JJ. Abrams was not mentioned in this title I bet he was pulling most of the strings, but if you want to put all the blame on Rian Johnson that is up to you. Also if you look at Rian Johnson's other works most of those titles are actually good so why wouldn't he try an take another chance at making another great film. Lastly if you watch the side movie Rogue One: A Star Wars Story that is a much better movie than the main one because it has no affiliation with JJ. Abrams (still not as good as star wars episodes 1-6 but a mediocre movie if you want something to watch).",0.10692866161616162,0.4624520202020202

The whole casino scene, which lasted around 30 minutes(give or take) had nothing to do with the plot.

"Went into the TLJ fresh of mind without having read any reviews or articles, slightly hopeful after TFA which I thought was a respectable attempt at a SW movie even if it lacked (or tried to rip off) the magic from the original trilogy. Seated in the theater for TLJ, I got a bad feeling early on during the Poe/Hux scene and from that point nothing surprised me in terms of how bad the movie would get. Apparently Rian Johnson had been dying since he was a kid to make a sequel to Spaceballs and finally got his chance, good for him. The only other rationale is he is a very sorry excuse for a filmmaker and has zero understanding of the source material. Poor script, direction, characters, plot, costumes, sets, effects. Had the SW name not been attached to this film it would have been the biggest flop of the year. There are so many scenes in the film that could be parodied, it's a comedy goldmine of bad filmmaking. It's not only the worst SW installment to date--and I am not a fan of eps 1 -3--but truly one of the worst sci-fi movies I've seen, and I've seen 'em all. Yes, the pro critics love this film apparently, go figure. But in the real world it seems to be nearly universally despised by anyone with a love for SW or even a love for a good movie.

"First off everyone is wondering how this movie tile got 7.7 out of 10 stars now down to 7.4 stars which is still way to many stars for this title and how all the critics seem to say this is one of the best star wars created yet. Well it all comes down to money Disney paid 2 billion dollars to get this franchise there is no way they are going to lose money on this or break even that is not a profitable business. Also Disney needs to keep making money on this title after it gets old an by it having a very low rating or getting negative reviews by all the critics a new comer to the franchise might be discourage and not want to waste the time to watch it or buy it. This is disappointing me that IMDB a trusted site of mine would sell out a long with the critics but sometimes that is what you got to do to stay in the business. Now the problem is that star wars was a great fantasy world with a very interesting story and something new in each episode created (even star wars episodes 1-3 in my opinion deserve 8 stars as well). This series has flopped because Disney is as stated above in the business to make money an they do that very well but normally the mvoies they make are cartoon movies geared at the younger generation with the intent to sell toys or family orientated like Mary Popins that parents can take their kids to. This is why Disney making the new star wars was a bad idea star wars was not made to sell a bunch of junk to little kids or band wagon fanboys it was a movie for adults who liked the fantasy world and others getting into the fantasy world. Even though Disney has trashed star wars they are genius for making JJ. Abrams who is one of the worst writers and directors of our time to headline this movie because that is exactly what he does sells junk to people who do not understand good movies. An if you don't think JJ. Abrams had a hand in The Last Jedi you would be wrong this movie stinks of him watch some of his other movies if you can sit through them and than re watch this movie again if you can sit through it. Although JJ. Abrams was not mentioned in this title I bet he was pulling most of the strings, but if you want to put all the blame on Rian Johnson that is up to you. Also if you look at Rian Johnson's other works most of those titles are actually good so why wouldn't he try an take another chance at making another great film. Lastly if you watch the side movie Rogue One: A Star Wars Story that is a much better movie than the main one because it has no affiliation with JJ. Abrams (still not as good as star wars episodes 1-6 but a mediocre movie if you want something to watch).",0.10692866161616162,0.4624520202020202

Snoke is an old ""sith"", he has scars, he must have been around for a while. What are his motives? His story? He dies, no explanation. Fine, but in that case don't make him old with a face that screams ""you want to know my story"". 
Jedis can now use lightning from their ghost forms. How about you kill Sith instead of burning books Yoda? 
Finn and the chubby asian girl did nothing. And they recruit a random guy instead of the one maz insisted on. Finn sacrificing himself might have saved the movie, huge ""wow"" but no, the annoying asian disney character even ruined that.
Rey is on a planet where Luke is hidden and she skypes with Kylo, almost revealing his lair. 
The whole Rey going in the dark side whole is useless. 
We know that imperial guards aren't force sensitive. We've seen Kylo in ep 7 stop blaster shots mid air, probing brains, paralyzing people without even holding his hand toward his target, send Rey fly meters away and make her pass out while he was bleeding.... and now he is at full strength and can't use the force against imperial guards. Both him and Rey struggle and almost die... Yoda in episode 3 knocked out two imperial guards by waving his hand without even paying attention to them

This movie has way too many flaws. As a Star wars movie, it ruins over movies by creating dumb new rules and removing old ones. As a standalone movie, it's a cool scifi flick, could have Cara Delevigne in it but don't think too much. To be honest, it feels a lot like one of those boring Star Trek episode where the ship is iddle and they beam themselves on a planet to find a solution to their issue. That's exactly it. And it's bad, slow and poorly written. You remember many lines from ep 4 5 6? Even from 1 2 3? You won't remember a thing from this one, except it being bad.

People go to Star Wars for 2 reasons. Fantasy and Nostalgia. ,0.0,0.0
"Three main points here. First, Luke Skywalker was absolutely committed, totally loyal and faithful, body, mind and soul. He did not compromise. That is why his character was so beloved, despite his flaws. Second, his path to Jedihood was very arduous, truly a pearl of great price; earned, not bestowed by some cosmic accident. And third, Jedi were crusaders for Truth and would die to protect the galaxy from the tyranny of the Dark Side.
 At the end of the last episode of the first trilogy Luke confronted Darth Vader yet again, this time knowing that this embodiment of evil was his real father. In this battle Luke fought not only Darth Vader, but his Master, the Evil Emperor. In the three way battle that ensued Luke bested his father, but refused to succumb to the dark side of hate and finish him off. Instead he appealed to the love that he knew must still hide somewhere in the shell called Darth Vader. Just as the Emperor was about to kill Luke, Vader turned on his master to save his son and in the ensuing battle both died, ending the Evil Empire and freeing the galaxy of its dark despotism.
 At the conclusion of this movie, the spirits of Obi wan Kenobe, Yoda, and Anniken Skywalker, appeared. Skywalker was the redeemed soul of Darth Vader, now basking in the Light and Love of the Force. Goodness triumphed over evil without compromising itself.
 This was Star Wars. A morality play, a rather simple story of cosmic good versus cosmic evil. The differences were clearly recognizable, we cheered for the good and, on a galactic stage of vast proportions, the Truth ultimately triumphed against great odds. I don't know of any epic fiction in human History that has told a grander story. That is why the atrocity that Disney has committed against this epic myth arouses such passion and anger.
 The Last Jedi looks and sounds great, but the story is a mess, with so many plot holes, dead ends, contradictions, inconsistencies, impossibilities, players out of character, deus ex machinas etc. that you can't count them all. Critics in mainstream media have overwhelmingly adored this movie and overlooked its obvious flaws, no doubt because they share the movie's underlying ideology. Fans of Star Wars have been much more critical, and numerous YOUTUBE critics have enumerated the movie's many flaws. As one critic said, ""This is Star Wars in the world of Idiocracy."" I will mention only a few of those flaws here.
 What I want to focus on is the Last Jedi's betrayal and repudiation of the Star Wars' core myth. This betrayal is put into the words and actions of the greatest Jedi of all time, the man who saved the Galaxy and seemingly vanquished the Dark Side forever. Luke Skywalker, who would have been remembered for ages as one of the greatest heroes in the history of mythology, will now go down as the greatest apostate. Its like, after hundreds of millions of people have invested their time, energy, billions of dollars, hope and love into seven Star Wars movies, Disney then pulls a Gilda Radner and just says, ""never mind.""
 When the latest great hope of the Force, Rey, came to Luke for training and introduced herself by handing Luke his old light saber, Luke, by now cynical, disconsolate, demoralized, depressed and dirty, responded without hesitation by throwing the light saber away. Thus, Luke symbolically expressed his rejection of everything he once stood for. He then went on to say just that in ensuing dialog with Rey, basically refusing to train her and telling her what a mistake and a failure the Jedi movement was. ""All I know is that the Jedi must end,"" he said, accusing the Jedi of inadvertently ""allowing"" the Sith to subvert the Republic. Somehow, his father's turn to the Dark Side was the Jedi's fault. Luke explained that he went to the sacred Jedi planet, not to train, but just to die. 
 At some point the apparition of Yoda appeared, and they discussed the anachronistic nature of Jediism, and the worthlessness of the old sacred texts. Yoda then seemingly set them on fire, along with the sacred tree which protected them through the ages. Symbolically, a very long and eventful life of reverence went up in smoke. As did the concept of reverence itself.
 Later we discovered why Luke gave up on Jediism and seemingly life itself. Years earlier, his nephew, Ben, the son of Princess Leia and Han Solo, during Jedi training, turned to the Dark Side. This happened because Luke, sensing dark proclivities in the youngster, tried to kill him in his sleep, kind of, but in self defense young Ben, (later Kilo Ren) destroyed the Jedi school and almost killed Luke himself. Thus, Luke caused the very outcome he most feared and himself helped create a Sith Lord.
 When Rey found out about this, because she was in psychic communion with Kilo, she confronted Luke, and after a brief stick fight, the untrained little neophyte defeated the Great Skywalker, and he ran away in fear. Eventually Luke gave Rey about three minutes of Jedi training, during which she explored both the light and the DARK SIDE, and she became seemingly the most powerful Jedi of all time, even though we are told she had no pedigree or prior training.
 At the end of the movie Luke finally showed some spirit, appearing dramatically to save the remaining handful of Resistance fighters from the new evil emperor, the last Sith, his nephew Kilo Ren. But instead of an epic fight to again vanquish evil and/or redeem it (the origins of the resurrected Sith we are never told, but we did see Kilo, improbably, kill his Master and take control), Luke wussed out and just projected a hologram of himself, tricking Kilo into a fake sword fight that took just long enough to allow the Resistance to escape. And then, inexplicably, with the entire Galaxy under the control of Dark forces, the real Luke just vanished, presumably into the Force, from which, we were told earlier, he had disconnected himself. Was this transcendence, like the ascension of Christ, or just a cop out? This Luke, this wastrel, who had rejected his precious, sacred Jedi inheritance, committed suicide to avoid his Jedi duty. What an ignominious end to one of the greatest epic heroes ever.
 So, let's compare the Luke Skywalker that was developed in the first three movies to the Luke Skywalker of the Last Jedi.
 The Luke Skywalker of Legend had absolute, child-like faithfulness and loyalty to his teachers and their teaching. Though for one second, like Christ on the cross, in his moment of greatest defeat, Luke experienced doubt, he resumed his quest steadfastly and attained his goal. He never wavered in the Truth again. He was always brave, always strong, always faithful to the principles he knew were right, and willing always to sacrifice his life for the right and to fight for that right and the rights of others.
 The Luke Skywalker in Last Jedi became agnostic, cynical, weak, indecisive, selfish, lazy and a bit cowardly, because he no longer believed in anything. The Luke Skywalker who would not kill evil Darth Vader in self-defense, Luke Skywalker the Great Redeemer, raised his weapon against a sleeping teenager, his sister's son. And because of this failure he just quit. This is not Luke Skywalker.
 No, the trashing of Luke Skywalker is not a literary accident. Trashing Luke Skywalker is trashing everything Star Wars ever represented, and Star Wars, despite borrowing so heavily from Eastern mysticism, represents something deep and abiding in the civilization we inherited. And what does the new Star Wars offer? Nothingness.",0.07020314071450438,0.5597772639818094

It doesn't even feel like a Star Wars movie anymore. Terrible writing and directing. Story has so many plot holes it's ridiculous. The only positive is the acting is very good.

Don't get me wrong I'm all for both of those things but to be crammed down our throats at the expense of the greatest movie franchise ever is very sad. They ruin Luke. Leia all the sudden is a potent force user. And R2 and C3Po get about 10 mins on screen. No wonder Mark Hamill hates the direction but he's right as long as it makes money right kids. True SW fans will look at this as an abomination and new SW fans who know nothing of George's amazing story telling skills will like it. At least JJ followed the New Hope blueprint and it still felt like a SW movie. This is just utter trash with so many things wrong it leaves you shaking your head. Please bring back George so he can try to salvage this otherwise SW is doomed. I've never been more disappointed in all my life.

"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the most disappointing thing since George Lucas sold the rights to Disney. A hyped-up sequel to the ""A New Hope"" rip off, this movie is filled with cringe-worthy dialogue, an embarrassing story, terrible editing, massive plot holes, and a surprisingly awful film score. There are some good things about the film however, which confuses me because it's almost like watching two separate movies being smashed together.
1) Apparently people can live in outer space now. In the opening fight sequence, the girl on the bomber lays on a beam that is open to outer space and suffers no consequences. Even though she later dies by explosion.
2) The bridge of the ship that Leia is in gets hit by a shot and violently explodes and rips everyone into space. The next scene Leia is floating out and about and just wakes up and flies back to the ship. The doors open, and again everyone is exposed to space and nothing happens. Leia dies a very violent death and then just wakes up and goes back to the ship and takes a nap. 3) As the movie continues you realize that all the buildup of Mark Hamill reprising his role as Luke Skywalker is actually a negative thing. When the anticipated moment has finally been reached and Luke is handed his old light saber, he immediately tosses it over his shoulder. This light saber was created and used by his father. His father fought with this weapon in the Clone Wars. It was given to Luke by Obi-Wan. Luke was trained by Obi-Wan and Yoda. He used this light saber to fight his father and save his friends. He turned his father back to the light side and defeated the Emperor once and for all. And in this moment in TLJ all of this history was thrown in the trash. I guess disregard everything that took place from 1977-2005. None of that matters. Luke is absolutely pathetic and behaves completely out of character. He hates the Jedi? He hates the Force? That's a great idea if I've ever heard one. After a quick visit from Yoda he is changed back to normal, but half the movie has passed by this point. 4) If Luke hates the Jedi and the Force so much and goes as far as to say that it should all end together, AND exiles himself onto an island to die with no intention of ever coming back, then why does he continue to dress exactly like a Jedi every moment of his life? Why doesn't he go back to wearing the attire he wore for the first 19 years of his life? 5) Luke eventually states that he went into hiding because he failed his nephew, Ben Solo, and that Ben has a power that he has never seen before. However, Luke knew Darth Sidious, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and himself. And so far in the past 2 movies in the story line there has been no demonstration that Kylo Ren has any skills at all. Rey defeats him easily in TFA and she has never even held a light saber. In fact, Snoke even makes this point in the movie. You also see Kylo fighting later in the film against Snoke's guards and he is getting slapped around again. Isn't he supposed to be strong in the force? Yet some nobody puts him in a choke hold and almost stabs him. 6) Another huge problem is the distractingly terrible CGI. Snoke is just obnoxious but it only gets worse. The annoying 'porg' penguins and later the giant llamas must have been created by an eager 7-year-old. And how many computer animated explosions can we see in this movie? 7) So Finn and newly added Rose set off on a quest that takes most of the movie to accomplish. Sounds like a big deal but it is simply to find some nobody decoder to stop the 'First Order' from following them. Very nice ideas going on here. Along the way they spend a big chunk of time watching NASCAR pod racing and freeing CGI llamas. Rose tries to explain why this is a big deal but no one cares about this forced subplot. They then get captured and sent to a jail cell where another decoder happens to be there and has been laying around in his cell with a key this entire time. What was he waiting for? Nothing. Actually, he was just waiting for the writers to tell him what to do next. Nice. 8) Later, Poe holds a mutiny against the acting commander and hates her, yet when he is stunned the commander and Leia both comment on how much they like him. I don't think so. 9) After they leave and arrive at the bad guys' ship Finn and Rose get captured. The villain, Captain Phasma, does the typical stalling when it comes to execution and has to find a better way to kill them. In the meantime, a lady from Jurassic Park smashes into the ship and kills everyone in this room EXCEPT Finn and Rose. How convenient. Then Phasma and some troopers come walking up in a formation even though they were all just standing right next to each other. Phasma gets shot but her armor deflects the laser bullet. I think the 'First Order' has the resources to make all their soldiers have this armor so why don't they? They have multiple giant space weapons that can destroy planets but armor that works is a little too much to ask? So Finn gets up and has a very anticlimactic fight with Phasma. Why would they have done it any different? 10) The movie goes between Kylo, Rey/Luke, Leia, and Finn scenes. Is Chewbacca just an extra in this film? Because he gets as much screen time as those frog costumed creatures on Luke's island. Kylo's scenes were all very entertaining and Adam Driver was very likable. Rey's scenes were also interesting and I was waiting to hear what's been happening to Luke, but everything else in the movie could not have been less interesting. I don't think I've ever been more bored while watching a movie. This is why it felt like two separate movies edited together. 11) After the Snoke battle, Kylo Ren appears to have also killed Hux, but shortly after you see them both standing together. You also see a similar deal when Finn is about to sacrifice himself for the 'Resistance', yet Rose smashed into him to save his life, meanwhile jeopardizing her own. But no worries because everyone is invincible in this film. Except for Luke apparently. I guess using the force one more time was just a little too much for him these days. It was a very uneventful and unheroic death for the star of the original trilogy. 12) All this buildup of finding Luke and he does next to nothing. He aides in the plot which is helping the 'Resistance' keep running but other than that he does nothing. Except for complain and die. He doesn't even have a light saber duel. He uses the force to trick Kylo Ren and pulls out his blue light saber, except Kylo had just recently destroyed that one so why did he think Luke had it??? 13) Before transparent Luke shows up, all the rebel fighters were standing in a hanger with the blast door open watching the 'First Order' stroll in and fire at them. Death and destruction could have easily been prevented and we're supposed to believe these are the people who have been fighting the bad guys this whole time? Are they as stupid as the writers? Oh. 14) Even a lot of dialogue from this movie was very childish and made me feel like I was watching a show created for little kids. Finn is sacrificing himself to save the 'Resistance' and Rose stops him. ""We're not going to win by killing the things we hate, but by saving what we love."" Well Finn was about to save everyone he loved by killing the 'First Order' but you just stopped him for no reason. And then she gives him an extremely awkward kiss and proceeds to pass out just like Leia did earlier in the film. How creative. Another childish addition is when they're looking for an exit in the cave and a CGI ice fox is conveniently standing in a doorway waiting to lead the people to safety. I'm not 9 so this doesn't amuse me. There's a lot of trying to lead you to believe someone is about to die, just to have a cheaply executed save. Boring. 15) The plot of the movie is that the ""Resistance"" is trying to run away from the ""First Order"". The presented problem is that once the ""Resistance"" runs out of gas, the ""First Order' will be in range to fire on their ships. Is the ""First Order"" running out of gas too? Is there a reason that the all resourceful ""First Order"" can't cut them off? Or by summoning any ship in their possession? What are all the other ""First Order"" ships doing at this moment? It's supposed to be pretty important that they have the last of the ""Resistance"" on the run right in front of them but all they are doing is following them? 16) Rose was unconscious at the end near the heavily guarded ""First Order"" battering ram. How did Finn drag her all the way back without dying? 17) They even couldn't resist having the droid BB-8 driving an AT-ST walker. I guess the children under the age of 5 need some entertainment too. 18) Disney is in dire need of a thesaurus. Can we get a word count on the word ""hope"" please?! Also, stop with the ""never tell me the odds"" joke. That ended in 1980. Why did C3PO have a red arm in TFA and not in this film? Why is the mystery of Rey's parents never laid to rest? ""Oh they were nobody."" K thanks for the movie bye. Who is Snoke? Why did he show up, supposedly being the most powerful being, and then die with no known motivation/plans? 
George Lucas' Star Wars movies were told in a unique way that could easily have been told apart from any other writer. It was almost an art of its own. There's a style to making Star Wars and I could tell this movie came out in 2017. There used to be a purpose behind the dialogue, and now it's just schlock. It was like the way Obi-Wan described the light saber; ""an elegant weapon for a more civilized age."" Now writers are clumsy and random, and people laugh at CGI penguins on the screen. TFA and TLJ both focus on what happened between Episode 6 and TFA, but the whole idea of training Jedi and Luke's interaction with Ben Solo sounds more interesting than the current movie's plots. Or lack thereof. At least Leia wasn't killed off in this movie so I'm really excited to see her return in full CGI....",0.09469773850921392,0.5149917796229273

"I understand this review may trigger some snowflakes. Get over it. Reason why I don't admire the Last SJW one last bit, is because of the story, the characters, the character development failure, and even more plot holes after TFA. So, it all starts at D'Qar, because the Resis- I mean rebellion, is fleeing from the powerful First Or- I mean the Empire. How did the First Order get so powerful that the New Republic decided to not monitor the possibilities of a future army rising after the treaty made after the battle of Jakku? This mirrors straight off a New Hope after the better Rebellion destroyed the Death Star. They fled, and some ships got destroyed when the rebellion fled, but the Empire was still all powerful because they had control for years. The First Order got control, in what, 2 days? I mean, I guess destroying 5 planets will apparently not cause any other systems to spark a rebellion with the Resis- Rebellion. Then, Poe Dameron makes a mom joke to stall the Dreadnought, which should've just fired in the first place. Poe Dameron takes out useless surface cannons. But what about the other ships? Why wasn't Hux shooting at Poe too? Then we have the ""just hit it with your head and it'll work"" cliche by BB-8. Then we have bombers appear, which only respond to Poe, and not Leia, although she told him to disengage. Bombers are useless and the battle was lopsided like the game of super bowl 24. The Rebels flee, and they are somehow being tracked through lightspeed. Then we go to Ahch To, where Crybaby Skywalker couldn't deal with his nephew with anger management. Some parts fo it were actually decent, but that's really the only good part i could see in the movie. Then we meet Rose Tico, after Finn comes back after a stupid reappearance. Rose is about the same as Jar Jar, but worse. They waste their time on Kantobite, because Admiral Pink Hair won't tell anyone her plan. Carrie Fisher, I loved her, and I think she should've passed because of actual physics. But, Carrie Poppins. Her plan would've saved 2/3 of the resistance, but since Poe was a male, she won't say a word. So, the adventure on Kantobite is full of cliches, ranging from finding a person who could do it, even though they are the master code breaker, and falling to their death from a cliff. Back to Ahch To, where they train. Why can't Luke train her, if he knows that Ben can't be stopped? What have they done to Luke? Luke was basically a polar opposite of this in 6, when he knew he could bring his father back. This movie reflects the combination between episode 5 and 6. I'm going to skip ahead to Holdo light speed. I'm calling crap. If that's possible, you basically just ruined the entire franchise. An x-wing being controlled by a droid could use lightspeed through the Death Stars, shield gate, blockades, etc., but we actually care about an actual battle. She sacrificed herself because she thought she was more important than anyone else. Now we are the battle of Crait, which is basically a snow planet but salt. Thanks for clarifying Rían, but it doesn't make a difference. It's another battle of Hoth. Then we have the most anticlimactic ending ever. Luke gets killed because all OT men will be killed.

Basically, characters had clear goals and there was suspense over whether characters would live or die.

"Where to begin with this film.
Well we can start by saying what a SURPRISING movie that you made for the FANS Rian. It's really odd when a director decides to go purely for shock factor rather then seeing why the decisions made by certain characters are just utterly dumb. Oh wow! Luke throws it over his shoulder like it meant absolutely nothing whilst ruining his character from three previous films..... Nice One Ryan. Oh wow! Kill off the main villain leaving JJ to try to figure out just how in the crap he is going to complete this trilogy.... Nice One Ryan. Oh wow! Leia got shot out into space and has been out there for minutes and is clearly dead. Nope she uses the force to Mary Poppins herself back into the ship...... Nice One Ryan.
These things were supposed to be shocking but wow did they just come off as completely dumb and nonsensical. I understand why people hate this movie but if you like it there is no problem there. This is all subjective. Even though in my opinion this movie is Garbage.
There is one good thing to say about it though. Adam Driver is a tremendous actor and Kylo can be cool at times as well as his back must really be sore from carrying the largest boulder on earth that is this new Star Wars franchise is.
I can't wait to see how Disney will mess up the franchise that I loved as a kid and still do. Somehow.",0.07438672438672439,0.6200324675324674

One of the worst films ever made, makes Plan 9 from Outer Space seem like a masterpiece in comparison. The only fairly pleasant scenes in this waste of 2.5 hours are those on Luke's island. Lovely to look at and nice scenery there. But even there explosions and violence regularly occur, as if the audience will drift off with without regular shocks to their nervous systems.

This movie is a blight on the star wars universe. If you can destroy a massive ship easily by going into light speed through it then that makes a death star an impossible option. Why didn't a rebel do that in the first movie? You could have them all on autopilot too. This abomination of a movie should be struck from the star wars canon. How stupid was the interaction between Poe and Admiral Holdo? Any army with such pathetic communication channels deserves to lose. Her plan was stupid anyway. Now I hope that Kylo Ren wipes out the whole sorry lot of them in the last movie. It would be the only reason to see it.

"Almost the first and half screening is more to fantasy drama with too long dialogues of bridging the storytelling, while overall much more to be improved comparable with most science fiction Star Wars epics & trilogies that always provides new space technology ideas of weaponries and vehicles with wonderful nature sceneries ; The Last Jedi is not having more creativeness including remarkable characters and with almost many similarities predictable stories and the similar amenities ever had made , and seems it is made most purposely for targeted China market aims.
And surprisingly there is no extra post-credits scene in the closing film as if The Last Jedi is having drained of story overall as well out of its production within-off budget (as usually Star Wars provide it in its screening history , whilst Marvels mostly also have it recently).
Even worse than The Force Awakens and Rogue One, it's losing touch cinematic & positive stories with favorable surprises usually innovatively created before by Lucas teams ; consider Disney should be having all the resources needed.
Some kids are yet able sleeping during watching the film as offering standard only limited typical space cinematic of star wars (innovative) actions.
Though having its new complicated release marketing rules and earlier enthusiastic promo to see it soon after watching Wonder (2017) ~ eventually it's sadly first ever feels that Star Wars new 2017 release is preemptive presumption entering the non favorable trend similar to Jurassic Park (1993) declining into 3rd Jurassic Park III (2001) and better Disney should fix it in getting much more Box Office as well much better Opening Weekend ; if necessary getting Lucas back with Spielberg also capturing wonderful Indonesia natures ; consider its more than 40-years epics history.

"Okay, so like I said in a similiar review from Rise of Skywalker, I'm not an avid fan. I grew up with the sequel trilogy (sadly, lol). I just finished all the Star Wars movies and completed the Clone Wars tv show and half way through Rebels (not as good as clone wars btw). I'd like to think I have a basic understanding of what makes Star Wars so special and incredible. This is an unpopular opinion, bur from a technical standpoint, TLJ is a good movie. It has great effects, great musical score, decent acting (good enough to make an average movie; I swear no hate tho), okay writing, decent pacing, etc. It's a pretty okay execution, hence the positive reviews from critics. However, it is a TERRIBLE Star Wars movie. The whole trilogy is just a copy of the original. I mean, the First Order is the empire, Snoke is basically Palpatine (but just a completely underdeveloped character compared to him), Ben is Anakin, Rey is Luke, the Resistance is the Rebellion, another death star, Hux is Tarkin (if tarkin was a naive, annoying brat; don't wanna curse rn lol so I used ""brat"" :/), etc. It's just a direct remake. Also, it's like they're trying to copy Marvel with the humor and everything because they know they are doing a bad job. TFA was decent, but TLJ really just destroyed the work Abrams did, and then...well, Abrams had to fix up the mess, but really just ended up doing nothing with TROS. I really want Lucas to come back and rewrite the trilogy (he can do the story, but definitely not the dialogue...no offense lol). But, who knows (sry if dis review is all over the place, I don't express my thoughts well xd). Since we're all in quarantine, better to start trying to patch up the franchise now before it's too late.

The TLJ is a movie that sells itself as a sensation at first sight but then on next day makes you wonder what the heck you saw: A very hollow movie with a story that makes no sense and lacks of ambition. I fear that there is a formula at Hollywood to film the latest movies to attract the audience very similar to the one seen in The Expendables or Avengers: Age of Ultron, Justice League, etc, etc. One liner dialogues, stories that make no logical sense, not even in fiction, characters introduction to show some portion of a story that may or may not follow further, the killing of a hero character such as in Alien:Covenant between film, stupid humor sense that is not even adequate even for kids.

"When the credits began to roll in the theater, the audience gave a standing ovation to the film, while all I could think of was ""Why?"" This movie wasn't like Force Awakens where it left me wanting more and making me wonder what comes next; all this film did was make me wonder why? To its credit, I did like some things about the movie; it had a strong opening scene with an entertaining space battle, and sassy Luke Skywalker I enjoyed, but that's about it. The biggest issue with the film is the plot. I know this is all probably leading leading somewhere in future films, but nothing really happened here. Luke became one with the force, Snoke was killed by Kylo Ren, and the resistance took a serious hit to its numbers and equipment. Like I said, I'm aware its likely all leading to something, but at least when Empire ended, all we could talk about was ""Is Vader really Luke's father?"" ""How are they going to get Han back?"" and after Attack of the Clones (as bad as it was) we could say ""Well at least the giant Jedi battle was cool"" ""So this is how the Clone Wars began"" and ""that's how Palpatine grew to power."" In the car ride home my friend and I were trying yo find things we liked about the movie, one of my telltale signs that a movie wasn't good. When I first saw Star Wars as a kid, I knew what I liked about it, I didn't have to think of reasons to try to like it. When I first saw Force Awakens a couple years ago, I knew I liked it, even if it was a large callback to A New Hope. Many things in the film have no place, especially the side plot with Finn and Rose (and I liked both of their characters) that could have been written out entirely, as it has no impact on the films in anyway. It was kind of like in Revenge of the Sith, where they knew Obi-Wan needed something to do until he fought Anakin in the climax, but they didn't know what he could do. Another big plot issue I had was killing Snoke off. After the Force Awakens, he was easily one of the top two enigmatic characters along with Rey, and with all the theories of who he could be, where he learned to harness the force, and how he lead the First Order to power were all debunked in less than 5 minutes of screen time. When he was killed, the entire audience clapped, while Just threw my hands up and wondered ""Really?"" He could have survived and the plot after his death could have remained unchanged. This film's biggest downfall was TRYING to have the character driven plot and emotional payoffs, and it fails miserably at that. This was the first movie I've ever seen in a theater where I almost asked for my money back, and what hurt the most was that it was a Star Wars film, my favorite series of movies ever. I love the Harry Potter films, I love the MCU films, but they don't even come close to how much I love Star Wars. I was hooked ever since my dad showed them to me in the mid/late 90's when I was 3 years old and was immediately hooked. This is not just a bad film, it was an absolute insult to Star Wars fans everywhere. That isn't a knock on director Rian Johnson, who has had some films I enjoyed in that past such as Looper, but this is inexcusable by Lucasfilm.

Start off with Finn got such a big cheeks and mouth that look like a grouper fish, Rose Tico looks like an auntie trying to act young in those costumes. Her face is so big and chubby there is no way of hiding it.. Is there no other prettier females or handsome guys choices in hollywood these days to be pick as leads? Or is it cheaper to hire these as to squeeze out more profits from audience.. By the way Finn is a black, All Storm Troopers are clone from a bounty hunter name Jango Fett which look like more of a Latin. All clones should have the same face and similar skin tone.. How come when Disney took over, it clone out a black that look like a grouper fish in storm troopers? Defects in the cloning system?

"Taking no issue with aping 'Empire', with a good dose of 'Jedi' thrown in there for good measure (seriously, there's a significant scene that's almost identical to its thirty year old parallel), the latest entry in this now farcical franchise has caused a great divide between the apparent critics and the supposed fans mainly because it plays so fast and loose with the cannon it calls home. 'Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2018)' makes more than a few questionable decisions with the classic characters and their established abilities, as it chugs through its overly long, narratively messy story stuffed with too many stagnant subplots, each of which cut in at the most inconvenient times and only detract from the true 'meat and bones' of the piece, and a bizarre third-act that's totally tacked on to do little else other than detract from what would've been the perfect climax. Yet for all its faults - including an incredibly silly scene involving Leia which may just be the worst moment in the series since Jar Jar Binks first stepped on screen, it's still the best 'Star Wars' film in years (the prequels are included, to put some perspective on that). That's thanks to an improved tone (aside from all of the out-of-place and jarring jokes), a few entertaining set-pieces, a lack of force-fed nostalgic fan-service, some general visual splendour and a genuinely interesting core story strand involving Rey, Luke and Kylo Ren, who has been highly improved from his last outing to be the most engaging character. Still, Mark Hamill supposedly disagreed with every choice Rian Johnson made for his character and, I have to say, I can see why. 5/10.",0.12656837606837607,0.5192792022792022

"""The Last Jedi"" is probably the most controversial film in the entire saga. There are some people who truly hate this movie. There are some people who think that it's one of the greatest in the saga. I'm somewhere in the middle. Honestly I could care less about whatever lore ""contradictions"" this movie upsets fans of the series with. Most of the ""new"" force powers here work for the movie. Also, you're complaining about characters projecting themselves across the galaxy through the force in a series where one of the main characters is a two foot tall goblin who can move rocks with his brain. People who are upset with this movie for very minor in-universe inconsistencies really don't understand that they've been doing this since the very first few ""Star Wars"" films. ""Wow, they can shoot lightning out of their fingertips now? Why didn't Obi-Wan or Luke just do that in either of the previous movies?"" Stuff like that. It doesn't really matter. In the end, these movies are all just dumb adventure movies set in a unique and interesting universe. What I will say is that this movie does have quite a few actual issues in terms of telling a competent story. The plot and tone are all over the place. Some of the characters and subplots are extremely rushed and underdeveloped. There's an overall lack of focus. This movie could have been trimmed by about half an hour and it would have been excellent.

Jokes were made, that made the film feel more like a knock off of Space Balls, rather than a Star Wars film. Luke is dead, both figuratively and literally. His character was butchered and became someone whom I could not support. The film is also filled with a lot of sexism and racism, disguised as social justice propaganda. This movie also takes the new characters that were introduced in TFA, and makes them all completely unrelatable and unlikable. The ending left me angry, confused, and utterly heart broken. There is no point in seeing episode 9, for all the Skywalkers are dead in the ""Skywalker Saga"", the new characters aren't worth watching, or rooting for in anyway.

The story of Rey is not according with the Jedi logic; we all know that a Jedi has at least one Jedi parent or has The Force as a father, but in this case The Force has no apparent connection.

"I was truly disappointed with this film, I have been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember.This film almost seemed designed to ruin the legacy that George Lucas left with the originals. For starters, the fact that they had a side quest that took up half an hour of the film is taking the piss, and the fact that it's only purpose was to tell us that capitalism and animal cruelty was totally unnecessary.
The way that they handled the characters from the original trilogy was criminal, they killed off Admiral Ackbar like he was just a background character. Having never seen Princess Leia use the force, I was surprised to see her not only survive in space, but to also then fly back to the ship basically unharmed. Meet Princess Leia Poppins everyone. And last but not least we have Luke Skywalker, a character who saw good in Darth Vader, but will attempt to kill his nephew because he thinks that he will turn the the dark side is just ludicrous. The fact that they had time to show him milking an alien and yet no time to show emotion is simply ridiculous, and then have him beaten by someone who has only held a lightsabre twice seems like a total waste of time.
When the head of Lucasfilm was asked what she wanted to do with a new trilogy, her response was ""The main character has to be female"". I have no problem with a female led Star Wars film. I however do have an issue with Rey, she has no character development, has only used a lightsabre once and yet is now the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy. Finn does pretty much nothing throughout the film apart from kill Captain Phasma and then nearly himself. Poe destroys a Dreadnought in the beginning of the film (I know that it was Rose's sister) and is then sidelined by Admiral Holdo for the rest of the film.
The addition of Laura Dern to the cast excited me, that was until her character turned up and consequentially added an additional hour to the film and then kills herself in a role that was befitting of a good character. Snoke had the makings of an excellent villain, and then is killed off halfway through the film. Kylo Ren seemed to have a cool story ahead of him, but then this film happened and he was reduced to just another crying emo kid that like to show how swole he is.
And onto the worst character in the film, Rose does nothing through the film but say stupid things and bring us to canto byte.
Captain Phasma was a waste of time being given that she is only in the film for about two minutes and is then killed off.

What really bothered me about the movie was its jokes. Of course, Star Wars is funny (droids, han, etc) but not to that extent and not so artificial.

"The Last Jedi, which came out a couple of months ago, was released on DVD, and Blur-ray, so I had time to analyze it. I was disappointed with how they treated Leia.

I'm going to start with what I Thought was the worst. Crait. The lightsaber battle should've happened. Instead of making something lame, because everyone likes lightsaber battle, you just had to make an illusion of Luke. Leia should've died, because you can't survive in space like that. When I saw that flight, I was so mad, and was thinking of supercalifragilisticecspialidocious. I wanted to be y-wing light bombers, and wanted to see more action with the space battles. The similarity between 5 and 8 is true. Resistance /Rebels are fleeing from the pursuit of the First Order/Empire, while the force user is going to a person in exile, and they refuse to train that person for a while, until they can understand why they want trained. That adventure on Kantobite was something I did want think was necessary. Just find the person, and get out. That man that was in it for the money? Exactly like Lando. I wanted to see Lando, Lando was awesome. I don't care if he ""died"", bring him back! He could be in the Outer Rim. ANd why wouldn't they answer to the distress call? They were all allies! Wish the music was a little more creative in some parts. One of the worst things, Vice Admiral Holdo, or Honda is what I like to call her, completely ruined my thoughts of the movie. Ackbar, who has been with the Alliance, for a long time, made good memes, and knows when there was a trap. Ackbar should've been put as the one in command. You should've kept him alive, because he was something original. Yet you decided to Mary Poppins and kill every original male character.

"Let me start off by saying that I am one of the countless people for whom Star Wars was their childhood. ESB wins by a landslide as my favorite movie ever. After the most recent reboot, this movie was truly going to be make or break for me. If it took a page from TFA and just gave us a slightly more modern telling of ESB I would have lost faith in the franchise. I would have lost faith that they actually care about the fan base and want to make movies for us and not just to line their pockets. However, this movie truly struck a chord. Was it a perfect movie? Of course not. Did it do something incredibly brave and original that not only hasn't been done in Star Wars, but in cinema in general? Absolutely. This movie has everything, the epic space battles, incredibly choreographed fighting, quotable lines, and scenes that make you want to stand and cheer. Even if you aren't a Star Wars fan this movie will have something that appeals to you. And if you are a Star Wars fan then I think you're in for quite a treat. Now, to address the people giving this 1/10 for some inane reason. I keep hearing things like ""This was out of character for Luke"" and ""It didn't feel like a Star Wars movie."" To address the first complaint, all I have to say is, it's called character development, look it up. To address the latter, I say be more open-minded. No this isn't a movie that fits perfectly into the confines of what the previous films have created. But that's a good thing. What Star Wars is at its core, is a risky movie that challenges the norms. 30 years ago when ANH came out, nothing like that had been done. It rewrote what it means to be a good film. Some years later, ESB challenged what we thought a sequel could be. And now, TLJ yet again takes Star Wars to a bold and interesting place. Because of that, it is the truest Star Wars we have gotten in almost thirty years and holds up to the originals.

Now for this movie, It is just wrong, I won't go on to the details, please check some comments where people had the patience to list what is wrong and trust me they are very thorough and hit the spot. Overall, weak plot, boring, slow paced, no questions answered or answers ruined the plot, characters are destroyed (old ones or not present at all), too much comedy, ALMOST NO Lightsaber fights, or the fights are short and not significant, no emotion generated for the characters (I have absolutelly no attachment to any character from the new saga) and the list can go on.

The villains are just a mock of what they used to be in chapter VII and the previous movies, and speaking of wich, this movie has even more jokes than the previous one, if the jokes on chapter VII where mildly OK because they were a little funny, in this one they are said in the worst situations possible and just ruin the rythm and little tension of the story. Now that Ive seen episode IX I can tolerate a little more this one because it tried (in the worst way humanly possible) to look up to the future instead of the past and make something new, but the problem is that it tried achieving this by ruining everything from the past, while also making everything new just boring.",-0.13483664772727272,0.5927320075757574

"I watched this movie last night again after watching all of the others in preparation for the new one coming out at Christmas. Some say that time heals, but not in the case of this pile of a movie, it actually got even harder to watch. I have to hand it to Rian Johnson, but he managed to do the impossible. Star Wars has a huge volume of novels, storylines, history, and legends to draw off of. It has a HUGE fan base ranging from young kids who loved the prequels and the well written Clone Wars series to 50+ year olds who grew up amazed with the original 3 movies. The series itself is one of the highest grossing movie series in the world. Rian Johnson had the momentum of a highly regarded, and super successful blockbuster, The Force Awakens to lead the way. And he had over a quarter of a billion dollars to spend along with the vast talents and technology of LucasFilm and Disney. Yet he managed to make an unbearable, boring, silly, slap-in-the-face mess. It starts bad, gets a bit worse, then even more worse, until it ends. If you read a few reviews, you can get up to speed on all of the really stupid, frustrating, parts of the movie. Trying to come up with my own worse part is near impossible because there are so many awful moments. From the opening prank phone call bit, to Luke milking the cow creature, the running out of fuel space chase, Finn and Rose falling madly in love in a few hours, to the end when the fleet is destroyed, and the half dozen that survived are happy and filled with hope as they zoom away in the Millennium Falcon from the corpses of thousands of friends that were just killed. It's really hard to choose a worst moment. Everyone dies except Rey, Poe, Leia, Finn, Rose, Chewbacca, and of course, the 3 droids. High fives everyone, at least our stars survived. If there is anyway they can rebrand this terrible movies as a Bobby Ewing type dream sequence (google Dallas dream season young people), they should. Put number 9 on hold and completely re-do number 8 without Rian Johnson and after firing Kathleen Kennedy. What a shame. I will wait for some reviews from people I trust to see how well Abrams cleans up the mess Johnson made and if he somehow salvages the series before I buy a ticket.

So sad. With this last step they have disintegrated the possible future of the saga ... not to mention that R.Johnson will be entrusted with a whole new trilogy!

"It would be easy to get into spoilers, trying to explain why this move was bad. There are multiple reasons. Firstly, it conflicts entirely with the cannon and themes of all the previous movies. And by this I mean, it does not just disagree with those themes and that cannon, but it goes out of its way to poop on it. 
Secondly, it's plotting is terrible. Almost everything that happens in this film is pointless. It's a nothing. The entire plot could have taken place in about 30 mins, that's how little of anything happens, and that which does happen is largely meaningless. 
Characters get no evolution, no back story. Nothing is moved forward. Again, the whole movie, the only significant thing that happens is pooping on everything prior to this film
Thirdly the reason why this is terrible, is the themes that are promoted, are far left liberal values. Environmentalism, anti-capitalism, feminism. This is pushed so hard, that all of the male characters are made out to be fools, incompetent, dangerous, weak, cowardly. 
It's really really bad. The visuals are good, but I wouldn't even consider this a bad TV adaption - the pacing, plot, characters, themes - all bad. The dialogue is bad. This film is also soaked in pointless cute animals, and sad dad/college humour that would be better suited to a marvel film, and here, robs the viewer of any investment.",-0.1729166666666667,0.5559027777777777

"""This is not going to go the way you think"", too right! A lot of people including Youtube's SCREEN JUNKIES have claimed that this is the worst STAR WARS movie to date. I don't think it's the worst, but I certainly don't think it's the best. In the first half I was quite frankly bored, and by the beginning of the second half I had already diagnosed several, big problems: 1) The clunky script had abandoned the emotional weight and grit of the previous movies. 2) There are FAR too many sub-plots and additional characters. 3) It's just too predictable and 4) the whole plot is quite frankly just a rehash of both THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI. Don't believe me? Here we go: a young Jedi abandons the cause of the Rebellion to travel to a desolate homestead to learn how to become a Jedi from a cranky but father-like teacher, ""it's a trap"" as bad guys close in on the rebels once again, half the gang is betrayed by a conman who they thought was their friend, the young Jedi has a dream where they see a shady figure that turns out to have the same face, the rebels prepare for battle with AT-ATs while sitting in a trench in a primarily white landscape, the 50% bad guy kills his evil overlord, the old Jedi master passes away and finally, a Yoda ghost appears.

They have insulted the character of Luke Skywalker
. Turned him into a cowardly hobo, fighting the main baddie as stupid hologram and then dying of exhaustion, pathetic. General Leia , they blew her off into space , would have been ok if not sad that she would have gone out that way , only to start using the force and flying , yes flying like a cross between Superman & Mary Poppins , then goes into a coma wakes again and limps on through the rest of the movie. With all the original cast members gone now in the stupidest disrespectful ways , it would have been better not to have them back at all , leaving their characters untarnished but well done Disney for messing this up. The director can't have watched any star wars films otherwise he wouldn't have created this load of rubbish . The 1 rating goes for the actors who I thought did well with what they had to work with , just a shame they were let down with poor story and script . Kylo Ren could have been a badass baddie, if they just kept his face covered . Adam Driver has the voice to give you the fear he's a bad guy a quality actor when used right , but let down in my opinion . Rey turns out to be a nobody , next. Snoke turns out to be a nobody , next . Fin and Rose , waste of time , next . They killed Admiral Ackber like he was a nobody . Why is there stupid comedy in this .

But when you try to reboot a franchise halfway through a trilogy which in itself is a reboot, you have to be more careful. Rian is an amazing visual director, (see hyperspace ramming and Crait), but this mas should never be allowed to write another script again. He effectively made a meme out of what used to be a legitimate form of writing scripts. Fin's side mission is completely pointless, Rose is annoying, Pinkie (you know who i'm talking about) has no reason to withhold vital strategic information from the rest of the crew, and to top it all of; Luke Skywalker, the man who tried to redeem Darth Vader and succeeded in doing so, feels like his nephew may be thinking of some bad stuff so it's chop-chop time.

"""Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi"" is a 2017 science fiction film directed by Rian Johnson starring Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. Back when I was a kid, this saga was a key element of my daily life. I had dozens of shirts and tons of merch and considered myself as a hardcore fan. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole six films (yes, even the prequels) and was always sad when the credits for Episode VI rolled, knowing there will never be a continuation. Years later, after Disney bought the franchise, my wish became reality. I was so hyped to see what the next generation would achieve in this beloved franchise of mine. In 2016, I finally had the time and chance to experience the seventh installment and although I thought it was great, it was still a bit disappointing as the people around me considered it as the best of them all. Since then, I lost the interest in the whole universe, especially after realising that there were way too many projects in this saga. Star Wars films became mass products and I disliked that a lot. But now that the final conclusion hit the theatres, my brother told me how great the sequel trilogy is and actually caught my curiosity, but before I get to watch the series finale, I had to check out the probably most hated entry of the saga, abhorred by the fans and praised by the critics. So, after four years of literal abstinence, I finally revisited the galaxy far, far away and it made me feel like a kid again. First of all, the film looks beautiful from start to finish and the modern technology enable the creators to create something that is way beyond phenomenal. The scenery and especially the aliens and animals are well designed and reminded me of the good old times. The other thing I noticed was how the film (like the MCU films) had instances of humour in it. I had mixed feelings about it, to be honest, on one hand it was kinda enjoyable, but on the other hand unnecessary. Furthermore, I als noticed the things that bugged the hardcore fans the most, but I considered them as so small and irrelevant that I even enjoyed most of them. The problem most fans had with this entry was probably that the director didn't follow the usual pattern of how SW films were made in the past. He went in his own direction and made some decisions that wouldn't appease all the fans, but this is what made this film so good for me. Nobody expected Smoke to be killed of in this film, that's what makes it so interesting, because they tried to do something all new. Also, many fans complained that Luke wasn't in the main focus of the film. He was never supposed to. All characters from the original trilogy only play supporting roles and are only there to pass the torch to the new generation. In my humble opinion, the only logical decision one could make. They already played their part, that's it. Now it's about Rey, Kylo Ren, Poe Dameron and Finn, the first two being two of the most interesting characters in the franchise that ever existed. Both actors are extremely talented, Adam Driver even is one of my favourite actors of the current generation. There's no black and white anymore, they both rank somewhere in between the old balance and that was one of the best decisions Johnson ever could have taken. There doesn't need to be an all bad guy anymore, but therefore people need to get out of their comfort zone. Next to this, it still had enough connections to the original trilogy: Luke and Leia reappearing, R2-D2 reuniting with his owner and most importantly, my favourite moment of the film, the appearance of Master Yoda. It gave me goosebumps to see the old puppet in action again, it tried to make such connections without losing its originality and it succeeded with this. Also, it had enough epic moments in it (the tag team fight, the face off with Luke) and even the side story of Finn and Rose was kinda enjoyable (still don't understand the hate towards her character) and in general it had a well thought out plot and story. It combined multiple story lines and it never became boring, not even a single second. A movie that runs more than two and a half hours never appeared so short to me. Of course they could have gotten deeper in the Grey Jedi philosophy, but I wouldn't consider it as a wasted opportunity, instead they did something no-one has seen coming, and I applaud for this brave decision. The death of Luke Skywalker had a meaning and it was a magnificent farewell to this character, as I said, he played his part. All in all, this installment is a surprisingly terrific entry in the saga. It's not what people expected, hence the sheer amount of hate for it. What others dislike is what I personally cherish, it tried to do something all new and went in a direction that nobody expected and that's what deserves my respect. As I said, I have been gone from this galaxy for almost four years and had zero expectations about it and that's probably my advantage. In the end, the general rating is low, because we all know that nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans themselves. As someone who enjoyed most of the films, I had no problem with it and it even made me curious about the final episode. An enjoyable film for those who go into it with and open mind. Don't expect anything, free yourself from frantic expectations and enjoy a film that finally brought fresh air into an old saga. Disney didn't ruin the franchise, they resurrected it greatly. It's an unpopular opinion, but I'm standing behind every single word and that's what makes me happy, because it made fun from start to finish.",0.14206005634577068,0.5434566755995325

"In the Last Jedi we have already examined the sad demise of Luke, although his twin sister remained strong, centered, wise, and maintained her hygiene. The demise of Luke is not just symbolic of the demise of his religion, it is also symbolic of the demise of white males as well. Men are weak. Even Jedi.
 Men are also evil. All the space Nazis who worked for the Alt Right First Order except one were white men. All Sith were men, mostly white. When Finn and Rose were in jail on the casino planet, they were betrayed by their shady collaborator, another white guy.
 Men are dumb. All the men did something stupid. Luke tried to kill his nephew. Finn tried to escape the Resistance but was luckily prevented by the Asian girl, Rose. The First Order commander, Hux, was not only a space Nazi, but an idiot. The Supreme bad guy, Snoke, who could twirl Rey around like a rag doll, who could create a mind meld between Kilo and Rey even though they were half a galaxy apart, got killed because he wasn't paying attention to the light saber right next to him, which Kilo activated and used to cut him in half. 
 Then there is Poe. He was the closest thing to a male hero but was a special kind of dumb; all hormones, no brains. He was a daredevil pilot but his insubordination cost lives. At the beginning of the film his heroics were largely responsible for the destruction of the dreadnought, but also half the Resistance fleet, so he was demoted by General Leia. Later, while Leia was apparently dead, he was bypassed for command by Admiral Holdo, a friend (possibly lover) of Leia. Poe, when introduced to her, (how could he have not already known her) made a rude, sexist comment, because that's how men are, even long ago, in a galaxy far away. She then proceeded to upbraid him up and down, calling him a ""flyboy,"" a speech so emasculating that I think even most feminists cringed. She then showed herself to be weak and indecisive, and in the face of massive casualties and no apparent plan for escape, Poe led a mutiny. The audience are all pleased, because clearly this purpled-haired space-witch didn't have a clue, and its time for some good, old fashioned testosterone to get a hold of this situation. But Leia was miraculously revived, (ridiculously) saw the situation, stunned Poe, and reinstated Holdo. It turned out Holdo did have a plan, she just didn't condescend to tell anybody, and after the plan to evacuate the main ship was executed, she ensured everyone's safety by using her doomed ship to ram the First Order vessel at light speed in a kamikaze attack. She died a martyr and a matron of cool wisdom. So, for a while we were made to think that male leadership somewhere on the side of the good guys might help. But in the end, we were proven wrong. Punked again.
 Resistance leadership in the Last Jedi looks like an almost total matriarchy; all leaders are women, all women are smart, all women are good. Cue Helen Reddy. Men are all bad and/or incompetent/insubordinate. This matriarchy is far more thoroughgoing than the supposed patriarchy seen in the previous Star Wars films. Oh well, payback time. But besides being misandrist, it's also unrealistic and unbelievable. 
 The silliness reached its apogee when Finn, despite violating the orders of the now tamed Poe, proceeded on a suicide mission to fly his space jalopy into the giant energy weapon battering ram that would destroy the last Resistance fort and completely wipe out all the Resistance. Just as he was about to finish his kamikaze mission he is bumped off course by his new love, Rose, who later explains, ""we will win this war not by destroying what we hate, but by saving what we love."" How sweet. PRIMAL SCREEEEEAM. Seven Star Wars movies have featured space cowboys, and a few cowgirls, who did nothing but blow up things they hate, like battle cruisers, dreadnoughts, DEATH STARS etc. against great odds IN ORDER TO SAVE THE ONES THEY LOVE. If not for the unexpected intervention of Luke right after that, Rose saving Finn would have ended the Resistance FOR ALL TIME. 
 The matriarchal leadership in this movie was hands down the most cautious and passive we've ever seen in a Star Wars movie. You'd think they would have avoided that stereotype. Demoting Poe after he single-handedly took out the Dreadnought defenses for example, or Admiral Holdo sitting around watching most of the Resistance get killed as the escape craft got destroyed one by one. The last attack getting called off even though, unlikely as its success might have been (aren't all rebel attacks almost impossible) it was the only chance for the Resistance to survive. Never before in a Star Wars film had the good guys taken such a terrible beating. They are down to a dozen or so fighters, no vessels. What? Where's General akbar? Oh yeah, they wasted him.
 The President of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy, goes around in T shirts saying, ""The Force is Female."" No, it is not. It has no gender. It never did.
 There are other Cultural Marxist elements in this movie. In a pointless foray onto a casino planet we see the filthy rich (white people) exploiting child slave labor and animals. All they do to get so rich is sell weapons and all they do with the money is waste it. Moral: rich people are disgusting, capitalism is pure exploitation.
 So where does Star Wars go? 
 I believe that eventually Kilo and Rey follow the path that Kilo is on and that Luke and Yoda have suggested; to forgo the past and blaze a new path. They will bring peace to the galaxy by merging the dark and light side of the force, creating a gray Force, if you will. The redemption of Kilo will come, not from the love and forgiveness of the Force directly, as in the case of Anniken Skywalker, but the redeeming love of a woman, Rey. Of course, this reconciliation of good and evil is a Nietzschean doctrine, which, as much as Luciferianism, denies the existence of absolute morality. Assuming this scenario is right, this love will be so beautiful, and so powerful, that anyone who suggests that sexualizing the Force cheapens it will be considered a fanatic. And after all, sex IS God in our society today. Sex is the real Force, not that metaphysical mumbo-jumbo. How can Star Wars continue with celibate heroes in this day and age. 
 But then what? When Superman made love to Lois Lane he lost his powers. But that won't happen in Star Wars. Young Anniken and Padme already proved that. Of course, in the original Star Wars, Anniken's broken Jedi vows were part of his downfall.
 What will the politics of the Star Wars galaxy look like after Rey joins with the Dark Side? A compromise, of course. Not quite a free republic, not quite an evil empire, but a benevolent dictatorship run by a wise and loving, bi-partisan Sith-Jedi co-""Presidency."" It will be a new Galactic Order, a New World Order if you will. If we just have a properly engineered, kinder, gentler dictatorship run by the right people, and if everyone obeys, then we can usher in a millennium of peace and prosperity, just as Darth Vader promised. But unlike Darth's this empire will be run by the gray Force. it will combine the best of both Sith and Jedi, good and evil; beyond good and evil. But ultimately when good allies itself with evil, or tries to transcend good and evil, there is no moral principle binding or limiting a government formed on that basis except the prerogatives of power. In the end, the Sith, Jedi coalition would not be much different than rule by the Sith. There would be nothing to stop the gray Force from becoming ever and ever darker over time. I think the Jedi knew that. ""I will never Join you"" young Skywalker said, in a more innocent time. So, if this is the direction of the new Star Wars, in a subtle way, the Last Jedi is slowly shifting our allegiance from the Jedi way to that of the Sith we had been led to despise.
 There still remains one possible way to salvage the traditional myth. Although Yoda tried to burn the ancient texts, it turns out that Rey actually purloined them, although you only see this in about ten frames of film. Furthermore, Luke told Kilo at the end that the Resistance and the Jedi would continue. Perhaps Rey will maintain the purity of Jedi mysticism by intense study, and maybe, possibly, the Luke who dematerialized into the Force can, reinspired by his ethereal sojourn, rematerialize to guide young Rey. Or perhaps he and Yoda can give her mental guidance as she rediscovers the ancient truths. She can then, Joan of Arc-like, pick up her saber and lead a revitalized, spiritually awakened Resistance, start a new Jedi order, and restore Truth and Force-realization to the whole Galaxy. Perhaps she can convert Kilo, the way Luke converted his grandfather. Or perhaps, as Luke foresaw, he must die. Either way truth will again triumph over evil and the true balance in the force will be restored. Then, that desecration of Star Wars known as the Last Jedi will have been a mere detour, and it will have been the critics like myself who got punked.

"Coming from a background where the Star Wars franchise had developed such a strong and positive reputation, makes one begin to contemplate the direction the most recent Star Wars films are headed.
From fast paced space battles to intense lightsaber duels, one is most certainly going to be entertained. 
The most recent expedition into the Star Wars saga includes many modern visual effects as well as humor- something the earlier films may have lacked. This recent embarkation has left many fans in ""awe"" and others in a raging dispute.
Recent Twitter and Instagram disputes between fans and the acclaimed Writer/Producer/Director Rian Johnson bring to light the obvious shifts in the general dynamics of the Star Wars films. 
Most if not all fans highly esteem and claim that the ""Original Series"" from 1977 are the pinnacle and ""gold standard"" of what and how a such a franchise should be represented. Once the 'Prequels' hit the theaters, many fans were repulsed by a certain ""dopey"" character (Jar Jar). Fortunately for the millions if not billions of fans, Jar Jar's role shifted. Certain feelings of negativity towards the prequels as well as ""less than stellar"" acting, created a band-wagon on which many quickly boarded. However regarded the prequels were, the films in and of themselves ""felt"" like a Star Wars film- something the modern day ""adaptations of Star Wars lack.",0.2106613123718387,0.43420369104579626

"When Episode VII came out I had this feeling they were setting things up to portray the old heroes as nothing but losers... and yet, I wish I could say I was prepared for what they had in mind for us this time around. No way I could have foreseen to which degree they would degrade the heroes of old (particularly Luke Skywalker) and the Skywalker bloodline in this movie.",0.041666666666666664,0.23333333333333334
"Everything you are looking for in a Star Wars movie! A must see on a large screen with a great sound system. The directing and cinematography was amazing! What a great end for the new and old characters of the saga. It was such a joy seeing my young son on the edge of his seat with a huge smile on his face as he was watching this movie. Until we back to my childhood to when I fell in love with this franchise. This movie left me wanting more and the sad part is, we have no clue how long it will be until we get another big budget Star Wars movie on the big screen again. If you're not enjoying this, then you're one of those Star Wars fans that no matter what, you will always hate anything new Star Wars, and to that I will tell you that you have outgrown the franchise.",0.18856578204404292,0.4625070581592321

It is such an depressing message that everything luke, leia and han solo fought for was useless. This film wipes out the whole legacy of every star wars film before.

The Last Jedi was suppose to be the best movie from this trilogy, and I couldn't be more disappointed on Rian Johnson's stupid decisions and lazy writing. People who like this movie say it adds ""new dynamics to Star Wars"" but honestly that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. The movie does not feel like Star Wars at all. Star Wars is always filled with creative and awesome writing, but The Last Jedi is the complete opposite. It turned thing's south all the way from TFA and it ruined Luke Skywalker!

 The entire Finn and Rose part is unnecessary to the movie, Leia floating through space... Phasma is like Boba Fett is just there to sell toys, the amount of funny moments makes this feel like it isn't truly STAR WARS. They disrespected the character of Luke so much, and after not using him in the force awakens, they killed him off to soon in the most stupid way possible.

The New Order have tracked the remaining Rebels and have them cornered and Rey having found Luke is searching for answers. There is a side mission with Finn and Rose in an attempt to free the rebel ship but it makes very little sense in the main scheme of things and is never really referred to again.

The list goes on and on. The worst thing is that there are so many times where you can see how great The Last Jedi could have been. Kylo coming into his own as a villain, Luke's rejection of the Jedi Order in favour of something new, and that absolutely stunning hyperspace collision that almost made everything worthwhile.

"I like reading bad reviews but I wish folks would be specific. I'll bet the stuff I wanted to change were details most folks had no problems with. I see lots are not happy with Luke. Was it his reluctance to recommit? His choice to live a hermit? I hear from older folks myself too who have lost their idealism and have turned misanthropic so I'd say Luke's character change seems pretty realistic to me. The claims about powerful women and lousy men doesn't wash, I don't think although I could see their viewpoint. Just today I heard a lady on NPR say she wanted to work with people who look like her and not the white men on a scientific panel. not that they did anything neg at all to her. They were merely white men. Period. So I can see how Last Jedi might be a teeny bit vulnerable to that sort of interpretation.
I blame bloated budgets and CGI. Fight scenes go on too long. There are too many characters. So many special effects they're not at all special anymore. So many spills and near death misses that one feels nothing.
I'l take a rubber Yoda and a rubber Jabba any day over the CGI creations.
The scripts of '77 '80 and '83 aren't great lit, but there's a simplicity to most of the scenes so that when there's a crowd or noisy scene, one appreciates the change. The CGI era episodes are so often cluttered with characters, droids, chase scenes, fights. one longs for a simple 2 or 3 person low key scene.
I noticed in Last Jedi the main characters hardly ever are in the same scene together. That's not a Last Jedi problem, that's a lesson from TV. Sure, characters separate for adventures, but they come together and form an ensemble at some point. Imagine if George, Elaine, Kramer, and Jerrry never even were in the same room. 3po, R2, Leia and the boys (chew, Han, Luke) belong together like Dorothy Gale and her 3 buds. Having said that, could be audiences like a nice mix in their ensembles. Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo all seem about the same height and fitness level , look 25-35 yrs old. All feisty and confident.
I could see a director exchanging their roles before filming with little problem.

It is disconnected from every single previous Star Wars movie in both plot and tone. Not even the brilliance of Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher can save this movie. They turned Leia into a laughable tactician in both the space and ground battles, a poor leader, and an unconcious force user while floating in space. They turned Luke into murderous psycho who doesn't know how to forgive. They wasted hours of time casino scenes that no one cared about and only purpose was as a bathroom break. Introduced a new Temp Female Leader of the Resistance and managed to make her look foolish too. In fact she was so bad that the main characters were actively rebelling against her and then they tried to explain it all away as the main characters were wrong when basic reasoning skills suggest otherwise. They created force powers and hyperdrive abilities that aren't shown any where else in cannon and are actually huge plot holes. Example if you can weaponize hyperdrive then why didn't the droid armies ever use it? What about the Empire? The Rebellion might have used if they were desperate too. Especially since their is no reason to lose a single non droid life.

"In the ever intense world of Star Wars junkies and mere film fans the new Star Wars films sans Lucas are a lightning rod of negativity and second guessing. I liked Force Awakens, but Last Jedi easily blew that out of the water. Is it an amazing film? No, and it did not need to be but it is well written, acted (well outside of Rey and a newbie character) and actually has a designed plot. Were there twists? Yes. Were some predictable? Yes. The answer is did they pull them off? For me, they did, for others, evidently not. The main problem with the film is the middle of the film seems to drag a bit, although it does because it sets up the final act. I loved Luke's necessary presence in the film, the unexpected humor and the script as a whole. Hamill who overall always seemed the weakest actor in the past (despite still being effective) truly here nailed it in my opinion, and where the film may have lacked at times, his presence lifted it high above when they needed that heavy lifting. The latter surprised me to be honest but I thought despite some plot points and pacing that were a bit much, thrown in with a new over the top, annoying character the film was easily the best since Return of the Jedi. Of course, the trolls and die hards will vehemently no doubt disagree, but that is their right.

First, I don't claim to know what the point of Star Wars is (even though Lucas explained it in interviews), but I can tell you this is not even close. It's no wonder the concept of the grey jedi wasn't invented by Lucas because it makes not much sense in the rules of this universe. It's already been established that jedi=good and sith=bad but Rian seems to think that jedi=hard-left and sith=hard-right so it's better to come to the middle or something? This has never been a contemporary political franchise so I don't understand how in this universe grey jedi could make sense. Besides this, several established rules were broken like hyperspeed and Luke being practically the most hopeful character in the universe etc. Also the direction was quite bad compared to even Rogue One, where the camera in space battles flew with the fighters to put you right into the action and the objectives were well visualized and oriented in the scene, while here it was just fighters flying all over the place with no clear objective or threat (completely ruining the tension). This is just one example of the bad choices made. Another thing that did not make sense was the slave kids supporting the rebels because they freed the animals or something? That's such a huge leap of logic, I can't get my head around that decision. In the end I don't remember much from this movie but I do remember being simultaneously entertained and confused at the same time.

"""A review from a true die-hard Star Wars fan""
I am 42 years old and i'm a Star Wars fan since i was young and i own a huge collection of vintage Star Wars toys which i collect ever since (for nearly 30 years now) so for me Star Wars is more than a movie.
Besides that i'm a big movie fan and own a 4000+ dvd collection (from Bogart to Schwarzenegger , from Hitchcock to John Carpenter , from Film-Noir to Comedy , from France to Hollywood...) so it might be my first review but i know the score.
First of all i certainly don't wanna say that everything was better in the old days.
Offcourse nothing beats the originals (Episode 4-6) where i grew up with as a kid - yet they simply don't have to!
ESB is close to perfection, but ANH and ROTJ have their flaws. The prequels (Episode 1-3) have many flaws (mainly the CGI overkill) , but the storyline was good , the music was great , they have some nice characters and most important ; the movies came from the heart and had soul. Then, after 10 years of waiting , there was TFA (Episode 7) and in my opinion JJ Abrahams delivered a very good movie. Altough the story was a bit of a rehash of the original trilogy , JJ was able to capture the ''Star Wars Drive"" (switching between scenes and storylines with perfect tempo and timing) that is so typical for Star Wars movies. Last year there was the spin-off movie ''Rogue One'' , which was outstanding (I personally just had some issues with the score, but other than that it was great)
And now we have 'The Last Jedi' (Epsiode 8) which i really looked forward to. Wednesday i went to the openingnight of this newest instalment and it was bad. Very bad. In fact it was such a painful experience, that i left the theater devastated after 90 minutes and returned the next day for another try (this time together with my 8 year old son who loves SW as well)
But unfortunately ; what a massive dissapointment!
Its too much of everything except too much of a good story.
The story is just awful and respectless to the Star Wars saga. It has so many (bad) jokes that it almost becomes a parody. There are multiple ridiculous scenes (the flying princess, bb8 in the scout walker..) There are unnecessary scenes - especially at the end where the movie doesn't know when to stop- which makes this movie way to long and at some points even boring. There are annoying characters (especially Rose). Again there is too many CGI. And what about the scene with the Race Horses that makes Star Wars looks like a Harry Potter movie!? From beginning to start its a chain of unbelievable choices. Almost like if this movie was controlled by people who don't know anything about the history and magic of Star Wars at all. There is such an overkill of force and tricks that it simply becomes a common thing. What happened to Subtlety? At almost every point this movie is such a big dissapointment. The critics all wrote good reviews. No wonder. Disney has become so powerfull that being banned for all other Disney projects simply means losing a job. Also don't be misled by the high rating. Wednesday thousands of mysterious voters rated this movie with a maximum score of 10. These votes most likely came straight from the darkside. Its shocking to see that Disney -with all the money in the world- did not manage to come up with a decent movie. That they hired a second rate director and used a poor script to mess up one of the biggest pieces of art of the 20th century. The Star Wars universe has lost a bit of its magic after this episode.",0.10719282774838323,0.5726895943562609

This, while not a total train wreck just did not have much going for it in way of story, plot, excitement, fun. The script was just terrible. Full of holes, all over the place, meandering and lifeless. This SW edition definitely ranks around the bottom for me with Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, which were nothing more than long toy commercials.

"Okay, to get the good things out of the way: great visuals, some interesting new ideas, decent acting and entertaining on the surface. However, after watching it a second time, the glaring plotholes and lazy writing in general just cannot be overseen.
The worst of those instances is perhaps the way Luke Skywalker, the sympathetic, optimistic hero of the original trilogy, is dealt with. While I generally think it could have been interesting to give his character a dark side, the way it is done in this movie is just terrible. The same character who did not hesitate to risk his life because he believed in the good of Darth Vader, who not only cut of his arm and tortured his sister, but slaughtered billions, is now willing to kill is student and nephew in his sleep because of some vision? Far from being a clever ""subversion"" of his character, a well written subversion catching the audience by surprise at first, but appearing entirely logical in hindsight, it is just lazy writing, and takes any credibility from the plot.
Similarily, the movie works hard to reinforce sexist stereotypes, Rey being essentially perfect in everything she does etc without much training (see Mary Sue), Admiral Holdo being blatantly incompetent (see How to communicate with subordinates) and Rose saving Finn ""for love"" when he was about to save the resistance from obliteration, something that is done instead by Rey in another incredibly convenient scene.

"Review:
I was really looking forward to this movie, especially as I heard that Luke Skywalker was making a comeback but I was quite disappointed with the outcome. I found the storyline quite messy, and there was way too many unanswered questions, which I found annoying. I also found it hard to get used to the moody Skywalker, who has completely lost faith in the Jedi realm, and it lacked wit, which I loved from the earlier movies. On the plus side, there are some amazing scenes, like the casino and the epic battles throughout the movie but there wasn't much character building, and Adam Driver (Kylo Ren), wasn't in the same league as Darth Vader. I was hoping to see loads of Jedi skills, which seemed to be missing in the film, and the surprising death was also a big let down. Anyway, with the First Order still battling against the Resistance, with Princess Leia in the commanding seat, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is trying to convince Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) that the Resistance can takedown the First Order if he helps them. As Skywalker has turned his back on the force, and believes that no good will come out of igniting his powers, he tries to show Rey some of his skills, and he soon realises that she also has surprising abilities. With the Resistance coming under heavy attack from the First Order, Rey returns to help them to fight against there new leader, Kylo Ren, who she has a special connection with. She believes that he still has good in him but he is possessed by the darkside, even though they both took down the evil Supreme Leader together. There are other storylines happening at the same time but it's really the Kylo & Rey plot that interested me. I have to commend the director for making the movie look fantastic but it didn't have the same spark that the original did. A lot of the scenes seemed way too long, especially the Rey and Luke scenes at the beginning but it's a must watch, if you are a die hard Star Wars fan. I'm looking forward to the next movie in this franchise but I was still was expecting more from this one. I have finally come to the conclusion that we are never going to get the magic from the first 3 movies but it's good to see some of the old faces, even though they didn't make a big impact on this film.

I love the franchise and I was 5 when my dad took me to see the original Star Wars movie at the theater. I feel like they treated Snoke like Darth Maul, a gimmick. They also tried to make Luke feel like Obi wan but a sadder version. I thought there was going to be a huge fight seen on the ground like in Empire but the new Walkers were just for show. In the end (not the real end) it made me feel like the way I felt in The Departed but now they have to do a part 9. The visuals are great except for a couple of scenes (hence the 2 starts) and I like Carrie Fisher's final performance. They could have cut at least 30 min off the movie and it may have made it a little better. *sigh* But hey we all have our opinions right? Disney, if you are reading this, I could definitely write and direct a much better Star Wars film even though I have zero experience.

There were a couple of redeeming qualities and a couple of good concepts, but all were poorly executed and left the film in an absolute mess. And don't even get me started about Finn's side quest! That whole segment needs erasing.

"The Last Jedi Jedi did exactly what the second film in a trilogy should do. It took risks, subverted expectations, expanded on the lore/mythos, took characters to their natural most logical step in their journey, took the story in a new direction and tried to move on from the past that this franchise seems to be shackled to. In the Force Awakens it is established the Luke went into hiding because of what happened with the new school of Jedi and Ben turning to the dark side. It makes complete logical sense that this is where Luke's character would be. Why wouldn't Luke be questioning the principles of the Jedi. Why wouldn't he be bitter and shut himself off from the Force. His perceived failure with Ben (his sisters son/best friends son/ nephew) drove him to this point. It's the story of the fallen hero. Luke like any great hero has flaws and makes mistakes but that is what makes him so relatable and in the end Luke becomes the Legend everyone thought he was by saving what was left of the rebels and he did it without even physically being there. That is how powerful Luke was with the Force. Expanding on the Force is a progression within Star Wars lore that needed to happen. The Force is a living breathing thing and just because we haven't seen these aspects of the Force until now doesn't mean they weren't always there and our characters are tapping deeper into unseen/ unexplored aspects of the Force. That doesn't make the Leia floating in space scene perfect, but I do find it interesting. Yoda Returning was amazing, it literally felt like I was watching the Yoda from the original trilogy. The fact that Rey is a nobody in The Last Jedi is such a breath of fresh air. Star Wars needed to get away from the idea that you have to be a blood descendant of a Skywalker, Palpatine, Kenobi or any other hot shot Force user (which is clearly undone in The Rise of Skywalker). I love that Kylo destroys his mask and forges his own path instead of being stuck in Vader's shadow. Kylo Killing Snoke and and fighting with Rey took the story to places we haven't seen yet. It was unexpected that who we thought was the main villain is killed in the second film and the apprentice is now the main villain and that our hero would be fighting along side him. The idea that he wants Rey to join him so they can destroy the Jedi/Sith and create something new together is both disturbing and fascinating and I would have loved to see what they would have done going into this new direction. Star Wars needed to delve into more of the grey territory instead of just good vs evil Jedi Vs Sith over and over and over. It needed to move on from the Skywalker story and try something new. The Cantobite sequence wasn't perfect and it did drag at times but I liked that it showed the political side of selling weapons to both the resistance and the First Order. Finn and Rose attempting and failing to help the resistance is a very humanizing plight. Poe having to learn trust and maturity was also a necessary character growth. This film is not perfect, the only perfect Star Wars film is Empire Strikes Back and nothing will ever touch that. But at least The Last Jedi tried to take Star Wars into a new direction and I will always respect this film for what it tried to do.",0.16464045214045211,0.4878856593142307

I still don't get it how it is possible to make such a bad movie, The Last Jedi is one of the worst movies I have ever watched in my entire life and I have watched a lot of them, I say the same words in 2015 when I watched The Force Awakens but Force Awakens now looks like a solid movie compared to The Last Jedi. With The Last Jedi they has destroyed everything I loved about Star Wars, for entire movie I had a feeling that I am watching a mixture of some new bad Disney cartoon and Star Trek with elements of Spy Kids with Antonio Banderas. The movie is watchable for first half, I love some parts on island planet where Luke is in exile, and yes Mark Hamill is the only one in movie who is really acting, others are really not worth mentioning, they are looking like total clowns, but total letdown starts when John Boyega and Mongol girl are going on some planet like Las Vegas, total disaster, totally unimaginative, and everything is becoming a total mess, and yes Benicio Del Toro in Star Wars movie, it is even not ridiculous, casting crew madr total mistakes, he is very good actor don't get me wrong, but for Star Wars universe definitely not. Then we have part on the main star destroyer and killing of Snoke, Snoke is presented like the most powerful antagonist in the galaxy even more powerful than Palpatine is killed in second, total unimaginative character, we don't even have explanation how he became the leader of new Empire. And for the end we have totally not necessary battle on some salty planet, it looks like bad imitation on Battle Of Hoth, and yes it is finished in 5 seconds, like Rey is finishing her training with Luke, she just take a look on Luke's eyes and after that she can do everything she wants, total disaster. Design of ships and vehicles is also unimaginative, and the whole universe is looking somehow empty and depopulated. We don't get any information who is ruling the core worlds now. I also really miss original alien species, the new ones also look empty. This was definitely the last Star Wars movie I have watched created by Disney, I wanted to give them a chance but they don't get it that Star Wars is not ordinary action/superhero movie, it is whole world with itself with history, mythology and feelings, and they have all erased buy this one. My suggestion is even better to watch Star Wars rebels cartoon than this, it has Star Wars feeling, and Rogue One it was definietely not a good movie, but it feeled like Star Wars.

Director/writer Rian Johnson didn't understand that he was making a direct sequel to a film as he has now managed to retroactively destroy many plot points from The Force Awakens... It's actually much much worse than Brett Ratner's treatment of X-Men: the Last Stand. A rare feat. Bravo Rian! Where were the signature Star Wars scene transition wipes? Where was the line ""I've got a bad feeling about this""? Are you even a Star Wars fan, Rian? In TFA Finn needed a pilot so he could escape the First Order, yet being set literally days after that event he now has the ability to fly anything with ease. Bravo Rian! In TFA there was a map left by Luke Skywalker so that he could be found if the resistance needed him and now he just tosses lightsabers over his goddamn shoulder. He wants nothing to do with the Jedi anymore even though he wears their clothes and lives on their island. Bravo Rian! The Last Jedi features a lot of underdeveloped/pointless new characters while old characters (from pre-Disney) didn't live up to their potential (Luke Skywalker, Leia, Chewie). Costumes (Such as Holdo's dress) didn't fit the scenes - she's an admiral in a battle wearing a ball gown. A lot of hypocritical actions like Leia pushing responsibility for military deaths onto Poe for actions she had the authority and awareness to stop (when Poe led a successful assault to destroy a lethal threat) or when Rose stopped Finn from committing suicide to protect the resistance and then telling him that the only way to win is to protect the people he loves (which is what he was trying to do and almost did, Rose literally almost got the resistance killed). The internal contradictions in this film are laughable. First Order are childish villains and would be lacking punch if it weren't for the resistance being just as incompetent (First Order are supposed to be a military, yet their general is literally toyed with in the opening scene by an idiot, like an idiot). Old characters are humiliated and killed in the most lacklustre ways. Epic Rey training montage missing. Phasma exists, and then doesn't. Snoke exists, kind of reveals his grand plan, stops existing because Deus Ex Machina. To finish, Canto Bite. Even the morons who defend this film agree that Canto Bite was the worst scene....

The way they mistreat the legacy characters lore and galaxy. The way the Break space combat. FUEL!!!

One of the other questions we had from TFA was who were Rey's parents, nobody apparently(this could be deliberate misdirection) again another missed opportunity to tell a story! Finn's mission to find the master code breaker was ultimately pointless as was the slow speed chase. I was willing to forgive it all but what they did to Luke's character was too much, I've never left the cinema so disappointed I was pretty speechless. His death felt very weak to me and just left me confused and angry. I was obviously sad when Han died in TFA but that felt like it fitted and served a purpose.

Instead of looking for faster ships to evacuate the fleeing resistance ship, the plan was to hack into the tracker of snokes destroyer? No wonder there's only 400 surviving in the resistance at that point. The characters are dull and everyone has a cringey moment cracking wise. There's literally no consequences for any of the characters decisions. Ray goes in to the dark side cave and faces no backlash. The kids openly free the animals in front of there masters and face no punishment.

For some reason it was a genius move to completely pave over what happened in the force awakens and openly mock dedicated star wars fans by telling the audience how stupid it is.

Let's be clear: I don't say that there's no attempt in The Last Jedi to relate to the great anthropological issues (which have always characterized the franchise) such as the overcoming of paternal hegemony, but, the few things that may have worked, have been sacrified in the name of childish jokes and grotesque situations. Giving the peculiar explanation of why Kylo Ren turned evil, by the way, was the only thing that may have really surprised in the movie, on which base, could have been settled a better plot. The main issue of The Last Jedi, in fact, is the total lack of a solid narrative structure and filmic logic, which, at least, had always characterized George Lucas storytelling, from the very early beginning.",-0.08766666666666667,0.5770000000000001

And there is nothing keeping me from judging them as films, and not personifications of corporate greed and creative bankruptcy. And so, I sought out The Last Jedi.

Much like the latest Pirates of the Caribbean misfire, I walked out wondering if I actually did love Lucas' movies.

This movie is terrible in just about every way i hated it my friends hated they destroyed the star wars lore and they kept on talking about modern day politics how men are bad and that silly scene i call superman leia oh and dont forget rose almost killed Finn he was about to do something very brave and save the rest of the resistance but rose crashes into him save him just for love and lets thousands of people die their own comrades i can safely say twilight had a better love story honestly it did oh and dont forget forget how they ruined hyperspace it used to work like you would disappear into a hyperspace lane and reappear out another one like a worm hole now its just moving really fast which if you think about thats really dangerous you could easily hit a asteroid and thats how destroy all the fist order ships how ridiculous and goofy a professional military organisation gets destroyed by asteroids how underwhelming this movie is really a 1 star but if i rate it a 1 star my review wont count because when i look at a majority of the reviews it is 1 star 2 star 3 star maybe but the overall rating is 7.4 this is so rigged no such things as freedom of speech on this website obviously damn communists destroying free speech. dont watch this awful fan fictions they are not cannon anyway.,0.02121212121212123,0.578030303030303

"From the very outset of the movie the opening title crawl is loaded with poorly thought out sentences which contradict themselves and feels like a first draft rush-job. Perhaps the greatest let down is that the movie comes across as novice story telling from the initial title crawl and the lack of flow and development just doesn't engross the viewer (no suspense, no real threat, no reason to continue watching). Odd for a Star Wars movie, it features very unconvincing villains who are established as ""merciless"" and without-substance-heroes who aren't really threatened by a merciless enemy because the enemy is a comic failure . The old Star Wars characters are dealt with as though the writer isn't familiar with them and the ""story"" ends with no cliff hanger and the viewer is left with absolutely no reason to see the next episode.
It's the first Star Wars movie I've ever experienced the feeling that if I left my cinema seat to go for a coffee and take my time coming back that I would have missed nothing of worth. My wife and my children actually fell asleep at around the 20 minutes point and they were loaded with popcorn and slushies! I stayed awake but was fighting the urge to just get up and go because I thought I owed it to myself to see it to the bitter end in order to wait to see if it would improve.

Leia uses more of the Force than Luke in the movie. The Supreme Emperor was not used properly... what was supreme about him again?

"It is three months since I saw The Last Jedi and every time I see something that reminds of the movie I am more convinced that Disney destroyed Star Wars. You take the Skywalker story of heroism and then betray it by turning Luke into a self-centered git, you basically add in Chewbacca, R2D2 and C3P0 as props since they have no organic role in the story, you create a bunch of plot devices that utterly lack foundation in the canon (e.g. Leia suddenly pulling her Mary Poppins self-rescue thru a Force she never learned to use, you build up a character like Rey (who is the single most humorless character I've seen outside of a Russian novel) and make her unbelievable mastery of the Force completely unearned... Well, Disney, you created a movie which is interesting and visually stunning but which is not Star Wars. ""Well, we're bringing Star Wars into a new place"" is so not an excuse anymore than it was when the ridiculous sequel to Gone with the Wind took Scarlett on a tour of Ireland and it no longer had any resemblance to the original book. Or imagine taking the Harry Potter franchise and turning Harry into an asshole in the last movie. Imagine how that would destroy the entire spell woven by the original movies.

Thinking back, this film only gets worse and worse with age, every crack, every inconsistency within the story becomes more noticeable with time. The film takes the most basic and obvious writing tropes imaginable and somehow does them wrong. Then we have the very confusing portrayal of Luke Skywalker, who acts very out of character. To put it simply, the reason why Luke is the way he is in the film is because of a stupid, underwritten scenario in which he made a choice so horridly out of character its shocking. When even Mark Hamill objects to the handling of his character within the narrative, that should've been the moment when they stopped completely and rewrote everything.

"Star Wars Episode VIII is truly mainly about the denouement of the story of Jedi master Luke Skywalker who Luke´s own Jedi master makes a cameo as a spirit of the force and assuages the conscience of the conflicted but always good Luke. It is a wonder and awed spectacle each time the elderly countenance of Luke Skywalker appears in the screen, every time is it as awed impressive as the first time Mark Hamill face appeared to see at Rey in the mountain island, the sacred temple island of the Jedi where there are the ancient canon texts of the Jedi, the tree of the Jedi and even a dark side cave under the sea. To see Luke Skywalker in the Last Jedi has the same feeling as in The Force Awakens when Luke grizzly face appears for the first time, now in the Last Jedi is a joy to see Luke Skywalker, and to understand that Luke is played by the same actor that 40 years ago appeared in a New Hope in 1977 and how Mark Hamill had grown old with his character Luke, truly this is one of the best cinema experiences that had transpired as a cinema lover. Now after all this good feelings of joy to finally see Luke Skywalker again and he does speak this time, it is time to get to the film. Again this is Luke´s story and how he has to see what Yoda saw in him so many years ago, when like Luke was now, Yoda had run away after the failures of the wisest of Jedi masters, to stop the rise of Dark Sideus in The Revenge of the Sith. Yoda exiled himself like his student does now, when Luke after his own failures exiled himself in the ocean world island, Yoda and Luke are similar and there is a lot of hope that now Rey who eventually like Yoda did with Luke, now Luke also does with Rey, he reluctantly would become the master Jedi of Rey who would become a Jedi knight and now a Jedi herself, Rey finally can have the teacher and also like Han Solo before, the father she never have. Luke is disillusioned, saddened, depressed, defeated after his failures with Ben Solo, his nephew, he cannot forgive himself from failing to avert the rise of the First Order, and like Anakin before him, Ben Solo followed his grandfather footsteps to make the Sith liked First Order rise in power like Darth Vader did with the rise of the Empire. This is in fact very interesting as is a fact that the creator and the genius who created Star Wars, George Lucas had read 10 000 books in his library and he had read a huge amount of history to create a hugely complex political world in space. One of the themes of the Last Jedi is that although History does not repeat itself, History continue to happen in similar ways, like a wise Levant king once said, there is nothing new under the sun, that is in fact History and George Lucas as the creator of the Star Wars universe, and seeing the complexities of both the rise of the Sith Empire with the help of Darth Vader and the rise of the First Order with the rise of Ben Solo or styled himself Kylo Ren, it can be seen that the director and producers clearly are learned men and women who grasped the historical significance of George Lucas masterpiece. 
Luke lives in the island like Yoda, because he wants to escape as far away as he could from his failures in this case Ben Solo, Luke knows he failed him as a Jedi master, he was Ben Solo teacher, and he was his nephew and for a mistake Luke makes when he saw how much darkness was inside Ben Solo, the drama is explained in three great scenes of the Rubicon moment, the no turning back between Luke and Ben Solo, the scene is depicted three times, first as the Luke perspective of the events, then Kylo Ren more visceral version and then most likely the truth of the event as the confrontation between Rey and Luke when Rey demands the truth from Luke. When the story is told finally with veracity, Rey sees wisely that Luke should forgive himself, and that Luke did not failed Ben Solo, the fact was that Ben Solo failed his master, also the same way Anakin failed his master and father in Obi Wan Kenobi in Revenge of the Sith. 
Luke is a good man, has always been a hopeful man, he is the man who believed in the Dark Sith Lord Darth Vader in the Return of the Jedi, Luke´s hope has always been vital to Star Wars, and now seeing Luke a broken man, without faith or hope, it is melancholic and sad but all hope and all fight is not gone from the Last Jedi as he will fight one more time. The answers of Rey´s parentage are not given and it is obvious that the corrupt, insidious, malevolent, liar, pernicious Ben Solo, Kylo Ren is not saying the truth about Rey´s parents. The questions of Rey´s parentage and heritage are not given, and one wonders when if ever the questions will ever be answered, who are Rey´s parents, that question keeps Star Wars fans awake at night and the answer is still not given evidently and Rey wonder still who her parents are and although Kylo Ren tells Rey that he knows who Rey parents are, there is little and actually no reason to believe a liar tongue Ben Solo, there is more in Rey´s parents question and hopefully in Episode IX the questions will be answered at last with no gray area with definitive faces as the origin of Rey, everyone wants to know, Rey too wants to know, Star Wars fans demand real answers. 
Well, as good as the Last Jedi is, the other parts of the movie when Luke, Rey, are not in are not as good, those scenes are hard to watch, boring even, without much of anything happening. This at the end of the movie becomes a dual match between the two sides of the force, the light and the dark side, represented in Rey´s hopeful side and the hateful and resentful and unforgiving dark side of Kylo Ren and Ben Solo. Overall the Last Jedi is a great movie that is not a masterpiece because of the weaknesses of the other characters and the scenes where there is not much of anything happening, this must be attended to by the producers and directors of the next movies, as there has to be an investment and good writing to make the other character´s arcs and scenes and stories better than the ones in the Last Jedi, perhaps that is the chatter about some fans are talking about in the media, the movie can be better. But as a Star War fans of the older movies, there is a need to tell the truth, if you loved the young Luke Skywalker learning from an elder Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope and now you see an elder Luke Skywalker teaching Rey, the new Jedi, you feel happy that the Last Jedi is a great epic poem about one of their heroes, Luke Skywalker and when Luke Skywalker again walks in the sky and in a powerful and beautiful scene when there is the sun, the heat of life, the sun is beginning to dusk and the twilight, nightfall and before the sun goes down, Luke is there in the sky fighting in a astral form and in another plane, with his great power and concentration, he can even change and touch events millions of miles away and when Luke Skywalker, a great Jedi master finally like the sun light at twilight needs to rest, when Luke helps the light and uses the force once again, there is like one of his students say, the new Jedi, that Luke had finally find the peace and the purpose that he had wanted all along, like Obi Wan Kenobi, Yoda before him, the force is one with all and Luke hopefully will teach Rey more like Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda continued to teach Luke all along, the Last Jedi is a potent, powerful love poem for one of Star Wars heroes, Luke Skywalker that in a defeated stated said that the Jedi because of their hubris, arrogance had made possible the rise of the Sith Empire in the zenith of their power, and now it was time for the Jedi to end, but the last Jedi saw Rey and perhaps he saw in Rey himself, and against his wishes, the Last Jedi did not let the Jedi order to end, the Last Jedi taught another student, a Jedi knight, a new Jedi to take his place in the sun, and Rey does promised Luke that she will not be like the disappointment student Ben Solo, that Ben Solo failed Luke, and Rey promises that she will not fail the Last Jedi, that she will be a good students, and seeing Daisy Ridley comely, nice, innocent face one believes her and there is hope for the Jedi and for Luke´s legacy and that there could be balance again in the force, Rey is hope, Rey is light like Luke before her, now it is Rey´s time to shine in the light.",0.18090890245740987,0.4656056837026989

And Rogue One was great in ways that I hadn't expected. It was also different, but made it clear from the beginning what its intentions were.

"The Baltic Sea, should you find yourself there, and you're the romantic type, searching for a philosopher by rowboat, you know about the two islands off the southeastern coast of Sweden. You're looking for Faro, the smaller rock, further north from Gotland, where filmmaker Ingmar Bergman called home, away from well-meaning but bothersome cineastes who had so many questions about the creative force inside him, until he passed away in 2007 at the the age of 89. Filmmaker Rian Johnson outs Ingmar as a secret Skywalker, Luke's spiritual brother. In ""The Last Jedi"", Episode VII in the ""Star Wars"" saga, Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill), a Jedi who lost that fightin' feeling, can't understand how this unannounced visitor, Rey(Daisy Ridley), a mere girl, was able to locate the tiny island on the most obscure planet in the galaxy. Towards the end of J.J. Abrams' ""The Force Awakens"", BB8, an astromech droid, supplies the last piece that completes the map detailing Master Luke's supposed whereabouts, which R2D2 kept stored in low-power mode. The two hermits, one, a fictional character, a Jedi Knight, who turned his back on ""The Force"", a religion that, according to its last living practitioner, does as much bad as it does good; and the other, a legendary filmmaker of Swedish origin, who directed, for starters, ""Winter Light"", the 1963 film about a pastor losing his religion and his parishioner to suicide, is linked together by Max von Sydow. Sydow plays both Jonas Persson, the morose and fatalistic Lutheran, and Lor San Tekka, a retired adventurer but active Resistance collaborator from Jakku, the same desert planet where Rey, an orphaned junk collector, hails from. The presence of the medieval knight from Bergman's masterpiece ""The Seventh Seal"" makes plausible the theory that Faro serves as the inspiration for the floating rock where Luke Skywalker inhabits. ""Bergman's Island"", Faro's unofficial moniker, had loyal residents who protected their famous neighbor from reporters and tourists, which became increasingly harder after the advent of Google Maps during Bergman's final years, but like Rey, not coincidentally, the film world sent its own emissary, Marie Nyrerod, a girl, to coax the old master back into the spotlight. Luke, inevitably, would unretire, but in Bergman's case, ""Saraband"", released in 2003, would prove to be his final film, but Nyrerod returned back to civilization with ""Bergman's Island"", the last time the film universe would hear from its beloved hero, whose camera was his lightsaber.",0.13175675675675674,0.4885135135135135

Worst of all are the appearances of Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, who, rather than be presented with iconic build up and respect, are two geezers wheeled out of the home to get some sun. I wasn't sure if Leia was Carrie Fisher or Ethel Barrymore. Knowing Carrie is gone also made some of her scenes a bit creepy. She was much better served by the HBO documentary ""Bright Lights"" as a swan song. And Hamill looked like the bum who asks for change with the cardboard sign by the highway.

"Okay...This one's a doozy. I'm gonna make this one brief, because the movie upsets me. There were definitely strengths in the film, performances, visual effects, that one lightsaber team up, and the relationship between Rey and Kylo to name, well, all of them. The Rey and Kylo relationship is actually the only real thing this movie accomplishes, now that I think about it. Everything else was pretty much just filler. 
Now, the cons. The whole thing was bloated and sporadic, and should've ended a half hour sooner. Right after Rey leaves Kylo after fighting alongside him, and he decides to remain evil. Sidebar, I wish the director and writer were brave enough to actually have an impactful storyline, like Rey becoming evil and Kylo becoming good, or them teaming up in anyway. But no, we're robbed of that, and no real character development happens. 
Anyway, there were a lot of plotlines happening with a different pace per plotline. The Finn and Rose plot was unnecessary and again, robbed us of an interesting storyline for a beloved character. Plus, the scenes where they're in the casino place were totally out of place. The other thing that pisses me off about the movie is that it destroys all the great possibilities set up in Force Awakens, for no real reason. My beloved pilot Poe had a strangely written arc that wasn't really an arc? I guess it was just showing him becoming more responsible and less reckless, but it was just underwhelming and cheesily written. 
Also, Luke Skywalker was just a totally different character than the original trilogy Luke. Which isn't a bad thing in theory, but when it's not logical aging and character development and just lazy writing, that's upsetting. And I'm just gonna bring up the obvious; Leia using the force to fly through space was maddening. Yes, she's been established as force sensitive, but never enough to pull herself through space when she should've died instantly. What the heck.

"When I first went in to see Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I initially walked away thinking it was good and that- aside from a few questionable moments- there was nothing wrong with it. But after taking some time to think about it and in reviewing the previous films, I realised that I was blinded by the smokescreen of the film's special effects to notice how poorly written and horrendous the entire movie actually was. Even my friends saw the flaws in the film that I didn't, because my love for the Star Wars name kept me from seeing the truth- that this film was filled with so many plot holes, retcons, and writing choices that it made me question how this movie ever made it off the drawing board and into production.

"Where to begin...I have never in my life been more disappointed or even mad at a Star Wars film. This film quite literally makes me angry. I have been a fan since the OT. I remember having endless amounts of fun watching the movies and playing with toys along with my older sisters. I grew up with Star Wars being a huge part of what we enjoyed together as a family. Just to put into context how important Star Wars was and is to me.
I remember the enjoyment of seeing the originals again on the big screen. I didn't really care for all the changes that were made for the special edition edit. I've always been a firm believer of ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"". However, although some of the changes were cringe-worthy at best, they didn't completely take away from the enjoyment of the film and the overall narrative.
When the prequels launched, I was just so excited to see something new and Star Wars after so many years. The story line was good but there were major missteps in its execution (i.e. Jar Jar Binks, wooden dialog, things talked about that would've been more exciting to see rather than just have explained through exposition, etc.) As bad as the prequels were at times, they still had redeeming qualities that had me wanting to see them multiple times.
Fast forward to today's Star Wars. TFA, while mostly fan service, did a great job at resetting the expectation/hope meter for Star Wars fans that had a bad taste in their mouths from the prequels. Even the first line of the movie was ""This will begin to make things right."" Although, it was sad to see Han Solo's journey end, it carried with it an enormous potential to be an extremely heroic moment for his character to end on. It also had the potential to create more character depth for Ben/Kylo. Once again, while not perfect and leaving a lot of questions unanswered, I came out of the theatre knowing I had enjoyed the film, despite its issues because it felt like Star Wars was back in a big way. I was really looking forward to seeing the next film to get some of these nagging questions answered that were extremely important to the plot and the pulse and direction of this new trilogy. I also enjoyed Rogue One which was a great film, despite its flaws, to hold us over until the next main course was served.
Now, TLJ: My wife and I didn't end up seeing it until it had been out for about 3 weeks or so because it's extremely hard for us to get free time together when we can go out; not to mention medical issues getting in the way. So we had most of the theatre to our selves with most people having already watched it. We didn't have much in the way of theatre-wide audience reaction to influence our enjoyment of the film. At the end of the film, I felt confused and extremely conflicted on how I felt about the film. My first thoughts were 'I think I liked it...I mean it's Star Wars, how can I not like Star Wars? It took a little while for what I saw to really click and sink in. As time passed and the more I thought about it, the less I liked it. The film picked up right where TFA leaves off, zero time has passed between films. The moment we've all been waiting for. Luke is reunited with his father's lightsaber; an object that carried with it endless lore and emotional attachment not just for those within the Star Wars universe but the fans who know its history. What does he do? Chucks it over his shoulder and off the cliff then walks away...my first thought, 'oh no, what the hell is this...you've got to be kidding me...' The entire movie although visually stunning, was filled to the brim with moments like that. Rian Johnson, I guess believes that good story telling equals building up people's expectations and intrigue in one scene only to undermine it in the next; ""pull the rug out from under the audience"" as they say. This was the theme of the entire movie: build, build, build...annnnd let down ""haha gotcha!"" They should have renamed this, Star Wars: The Endless ""Gotcha"". Even without the mind-numbing amount of ""gotcha"" moments, the overall plot was ill-conceived, at best. Plot motivations made no logical sense and the character development during this 2 1/2 hour long mess, was rife with missed opportunities and decision making that served only the purpose of moving the plot forward but carried little logical weight. As far as any of the answers that were set up by TFA, Rian Johnson, gave answers in TLJ that were either dumbfounding, irritatingly unsatisfying or completely ignored. I have a big problem with how the character of Luke was handled in this film; extremely unflattering vision for someone who has been a childhood hero to many, downright criminal. Luke's character wasn't just ended in this trilogy, it was utterly destroyed; such a waste. Although, I really like the idea of Rey's character, she was given zero depth in this film and those who believed she was nothing more than a ""Mary Sue"" in TFA, have had their suspicions confirmed. She's only just found out about the force with in the span of what, a few days? After almost zero time and two lessons from Luke, she's a full fledged Jedi who can best Luke, Kylo and pretty much anyone else; lame. Why are we supposed to care about this character who seems to have no trouble being the best at everything she does? How is this character relatable? Bad character development and bad writing. But so long as Kathleen Kennedy loves it.... ""The Force Is Female""; no that's not sexist....Ex machinas and Macguffins were an epidemic in this film. I also left the theatre with a headache from all the heavy-handed political nods this movie beat me over the head with. These explicitly overt extreme leftist mentalities are probably what made me more angry than anything else in this film. I'm sorry but if I wanted the current pulse of politics and social unrest in America while having extreme liberal propaganda shoved down my throat, I would've turned on a documentary or the news; not Star Wars which says a lot for being mostly liberal myself. I could go on and on about the issues with this film but that would turn this review into an essay. bottom line, this continuation of the saga was such a disappointment. Time will tell but I think Rian Johnson killed this trilogy, as I, as well as many others, have completely lost interest in it. For the first time in my history on this planet, there is a Star Wars movie I don't want to own and have no interest in seeing again. Thanks Rian Johnson, how bold of you...",0.10915610183467325,0.5161944702123273

So it's that in mind that I write this review of the second in the latest trilogy and declare this was even better than The Force Awakens. First, Mark Hamill makes a welcome return as Luke Skywalker though not having the same attitudes as his previous portrayal. I actually found this quite refreshing as it gave Hamill new nuances of his characterization. I also liked many of the new characters introduced here. Also, John Williams has not lost his touch in once again scoring another series entry. He's always the best at what he's done and this is no exception!

The Last Jedi is a big budget fanf(l)ic and doesn't feel as a continuation of TFA which was IMO a very good movie to rekindle the franchise. This is only one of the many flaws of this movie. 
But the biggest flaw however is how they handled Luke Skywalker, it was awful and completely out of character. They wanted to create a shock element in expense of one of the most iconic movie characters of all time, Luke Skywalker. The core trait of Luke was to never give up on people, because of this he could redeem his father in the Original Trilogy. They just ripped this trait out of the character so they could create a shock element. Why? Couldn't they come up with a more creative idea? There are a lot of fan theories created after TFA that make so much more sense and are much more coherent then what they did in TLJ.

"Not only was this a terrible Star Wars movie, it was just a bad movie. How do you have the second part of a trilogy have no connection to the first part??? The whole movie is just ""the most boring space chase"" in cinema history. To have so many fans built up and excited to Luke Skywalkers return just to turn him into a crazy, alien tit milking, hermit by itself deserves a 0star review. At least he will have a scene or some good reason for being a completely different character... Not really just in Kylos room while he slept and thought about killing him. Really that's it??? Sounds like he already lost his mind by sneaking in on his nephew to watch him sleep. Why not have a short scene of Kylo picking on another apprentice or using his powers to do something bad so that Luke has a reason to be suspicious. This could've shown the schools destruction and the formation of the Knights of Ren (who were never mentioned even though they were one of the best parts of TFA). Rey's development consists of talking to Kylo via the force FaceTime and swinging a lightsaber at a rock about 5 times total. Turns out it's enough training for her to take out Snokes highly trained guards while she fights along side Kylo (who almost dies but Rey saves her...makes sense). Canto Bight was garbage, little to no character development and had really bad CGI. The forced diversity of this movie completely ruined a few parts of the movie. Force comedy was not funny. I feel cheated from seeing high critics scores that I believed this movie was going to be awesome and excited to watch only to find out after watching the movie that it was awful. Wish I could get my money back from renting cause the critic scores are definitely false advertisements of the film. I highly recommend avoiding this one because it single handily ruined the trilogy because they wanted to be edgy.",-0.041348214285714266,0.5754404761904761

"Not only is this horribly misthought abortion of a film the worst Starwars film ever made, it is also one of the worst films ever made.
We all waited two years to see how the epic ending of the The Force Awakens would pan out, morphing into the next chapter. To say it was disappointing and was a harsh kick in the nuts to ALL Starwars fans would be the understatement of the century.
It takes what JJ accomplished in the first new film, picks it up, then wipes its rectum with it.
The epic moment we all waited for was soiled in some sort of sick joke, as Luke throws the lightsaber away in a sort of terrible attempt at comedy. It lost me right then and there.
Was there bad blood between Rian and JJ? It seems the only logical conclusion to why he would destroy all the hard work put into the first new film by a far superior director and storyteller. Maybe he was jealous? Maybe he has an exceptionally low IQ? 
If there was ever a film that was a red-hot candidate to be instantly remade - this is it.
I hated the prequels, and never thought Starwars could go lower - but it has. TLJ has absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever. None. At least the prequels had Darth Maul!
The script falls so short, and is so nonsensical, that I actually felt sorry for the actors. 
The approval score of 7.1 is obviously fake - as the only people that actually liked this film were those that have no appreciation of cinema at all, and would get amped about going to see Transformers or Fast and Furious 28 after a lengthy session eating McDonalds at the foodcourt. 
The fan reviews speak for themselves. Who are you trying to fool?
I wanted a Starwars film. Nothing much to ask - just a space opera that continues the saga that we all grew up with, and also features (pays tribute) to the timeless characters that we all know and love. This film is an insult to the senses - and also an insult to the memories of the actors, writers, crew and fans of every single film made previously. 
I grew up loving Starwars, and was so excited to be at the global premiere of this appalling film. Personally, it wouldn't have taken much to please me, and send me to the 'Galaxy far, far away' once again. I wasn't there to critique, I was there to relive my childhood. My childhood (and every other fanboy's) was totally disregarded, and my love of Starwars tainted forever - and my excitement for ANY new Starwars films is now non-existant.
Yet I walked out of this film silent, with my heart broken - wondering what I had just witnessed?
The only thing that is even remotely interesting is how they will come back after such a terrible film that made SO much money? If you liked it, you are an idiot. Sorry, but it's the truth.
I'd give it no stars, but I have to put one star in to make the review viewable.
Shame on you Rian Johnson. You should be held accountable and globally shamed for this atrocious excuse for a Starwars film. You are the 'dubstep' of cinema - a flash in the pan that was sub-par throughout, and only cherished by those that never experienced the magic of the golden years.

It takes the franchise and shakes it up to new levels of writing and intensity we never thought possible! As a huge Star Wars fan, I've tried my hand at writing fan fiction and I could not have written anything better. The first 5 minutes alone are some of the best in the franchise. I have never laughed so hard during a Star Wars movie than I did in the first 5 minutes. The dialogue is riveting, the plot twists are insane, and the characters, both old and new have definitely developed a lot more. There's a reason Lucasfilm gave the director of this film, Rian Johnson, 3 more Star Wars films to direct after episode 9 comes out. It is certainly well deserved. The film is like a rollercoaster that flips you upside down, backwards, zigzags and jsut when you think you're done, throws you for a loop one last time.

We just always think, well, this is Johnny, but his achievement here is no less than any of his other compositions.

"I am eleven years old. I am a giant Star Wars fan. My dad showed me Star Wars : A New Hope in October of 2015. I couldn't stop watching. For two days, I watched a trilogy a day. I bought Star Wars Battlefront 2015 (Ultimate Edition) and even Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2017 and after micro transactions were removed). 
 I had watched Star Wars The Force Awakens on premiere night and Rogue One the day after it came out. I spent two years learning everything I could about Star Wars and the Force. I made theories about who Supreme Leader Snoke was. 
 Then the trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi landed. The movie seemed like your average epic Star Wars movie to me. My dad and I waited for the minute Star Wars tickets came out to buy them. We purchased tickets to an early screening at an IMAX. I waited and waited until ... the day finally came.
 It was December fourteenth, 8:45 PM. Our screening was at 10:20 Pm, but I wanted to make sure we got good seats, so I asked my dad if we could leave at nine. I jumped up and down for fifteen minutes in my TFA hoodie. We left and made it to the line at around 9:20 PM. I waited in the cold, foul-smelling line for forty minutes until they let us into the theater. 
 After twenty minutes of previews, the movie started. 
A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far, Far Away ...
 And the iconic Star Wars crawl started. Then, of course, there was the beginning of the movie. The moment Poe started making those bizarre jokes I knew I was about to be disappointed. 
And I was.
 From the corny jokes to the new animals made to be merchandise, this movie was horrible. Luke Skywalker didn't act like a Jedi AT ALL. And then Rey changed ALOT in just a few seconds, as The Last Jedi starts second after The Force Awakens. Rey was wise and Luke was acting like he was the one who was young and naive. A Jedi is supposed to have optimism and always fight for balance in the Force.
 And then there was the whole force telepathy thing. If that existed all along, why didn't the Jedi use it in the prequels when communications were jammed? 
 Also, how comes force ghosts can make contact with the outside world now? That wasn't a thing before.

"I am amazed at the rating is 7.5. This movie is god aweful! The length of the movie was fine if they had made it right. The plot was terrible, and I am amazed at how Rey is the first Jedi in history to be self trained. For those who expecting to see some cool training like Yoda training Luke like in Empire Strikes back, think again. Rey is a master Jedi with no training. The once powerful Jedi Luke Skywalker has been turned into a scared, wimpy, pouting little baby who is hiding on a foreign planet, while his sister and friends are about to be killed by the First Order. Luke Skywalker who lectured Han Solo in a New Hope and about not fighting for the Rebellion to take out the Death Star, is now willing to hide on a foreign planet scared of his own shadow. Pathetic, this movie is designed to make Rey a woman the main character and the most powerful Jedi and get rid of Luke Skywalker from being the focus of the trilogy. Rey battles Luke in hand to hand combat and beats Luke easily. Ridiculous. That's like Luke beating Yoda in a fight while training in Empire strikes back.

"It's insane that The Last Jedi managed to be worse than The Phantom Menace. Where can you even start? The only positive thing about the entire movie are the effects and that's not a selling point in 2017. People like to hate on The Force Awakens (rightfully so to some degree) but this movie not only renders TFA completely irrelevant but it also managed to make everything worse. Plot points that were established in the previous movie are simply ignored or finished in ways that contradict important lore. Luke Skywalker was completely ruined as a character. Maybe they tried to simplify him so that he fits in with Emo Ren or Rey Sue, there is no logical explanation for his sudden change of personality and goals. Mark Hamill was extremely unhappy with the direction his character and SW itself is going but they just ignored him anyway. It's hard to write a review without spoilers so all i can do is repeat what Hamill himself said about TLJ: ""If you think you're gonna go into the movie and recapture your childhood, you set yourself up for disappointment"". The trio from the OT signed their contracts before Disney acquired the IP. They were all extremely unhappy with that decisions. Now they are finally free from the devil.

"I decided to give The Last Jedi a second chance and see if I could understand better how come it is so divisive. I belong to that 50% of people who saw it at the cinema in 2017 and felt completely heartbroken. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a work of art in my whole life. Not only I got bored, I felt so let down, so angry. The film even managed to ruin my love for Star Wars as a whole. I wasn't able to watch or read any Star Wars content for about a year. My illusion was gone, my heroes tainted, the stories I had once adored now felt dumb and broken. And yet, I could see that some people genuinely liked The Last Jedi, and many film critics praised it. So, was I wrong? Did I overreact? Did I focus too much on what I didn't like instead of allowing myself to enjoy a novel approach on my beloved saga? I recently rewatched Episode 8 with an open mind to challenge myself.
The truth is the film is not the bland, boring, nonsensical heresy I remembered. It isn't a cinematic masterpiece either. And, ""from a certain point of view"", it is both things at the same time.
The Last Jedi is probably the most beautiful film in the whole of Star Wars. It is gorgeously shot. It is full of poetry and symbolism. It also has one of the best soundtracks in the saga. Very possibly, the best since the Return of the Jedi. The mixture of music and cinematography is stunning. A treat for the senses.
The story is simple, but it works, and it even challenges the viewer with some unexpected twists, driven by a concept that is repeated througout the film: you must let the past die, look forward. Sure, there is a kiss that feels shoehorned because there must be a love story, a dramatic situation that is dragged for so long it ends up not being dramatic at all, some pedagogical moments that feel cringy, pretty bad humour and a main character that is so flawless it is hard to connect with her. And yet, overall, the story is consistent and interesting, plus it is told beautifully.
Doesn't sound too bad though, does it? So, why did it disappoint me so much when I first saw it? Was I a bit of a drama queen? I probably was, yes, but that doesn't change the fact The Last Jedi is a disappointment.
The reason why I felt so heartbroken back in 2017, and the reason why I still can't really enjoy this film even if I must admit it is not that bad as I once thought, is that it not only ignores the lore and the atmosphere of the older films, it doesn't even respect the previous installment of the sequels. It goes its own way, which would be okay if this was some spin off with new characters, but it isn't. For the invested Star Wars fan, the sequels, and The Last Jedi in particular, are a frustrating and disappointing experience.
JJ Abrams was so scared of the fans it risked nothing on The Force Awakens. Anything that could have been challenging or new, was left as a cliffhanger or a black box. The infamous ""good story for another time"" quote summarises well what I felt throughout the whole film. Everything is either a lazy copy of the original trilogy or a story for another time. Why is Rey so overpowered without training? Who's Snoke? Who's Maz? What is the First Order? Is Finn force sensitive? Was Han waiting for Rey? As disappointing as it was, I believed at the time I could be forgiving because it was the first part in a trilogy.
The Last Jedi not only didn't bother to deal with any of those questions left unanswered by the Force Awakens, it went against what was built by that film, creating confusion and frustration on viewers like me. Characters that seemed to go on a direction, suddenly go on a different one. Even established characters like Luke Skywalker are drastically changed so they can match the film's message. Where JJ Abrams philosophy was ""don't risk"" and ""repeat what worked in the past"", Rian Johnson's was, ""grow up"", ""kill the past"". In my humble opinion, both approaches are wrong or, at the very least, they weren't accomplished with enough skill and taste.
Rian Johnson believes the manichean concept of good and evil in Star Wars is too simple and must evolve. He thinks heroes like Luke Skywalker must be shown as pathetic relics, so we learn that we should all fend for ourselves, we must not rely on heroes. Instead, we can all be heroes, like Rey or the broom boy. Beautiful concept, if it wasn't because it isn't what we have seen in the previous 7 films of the saga (Jedi knights are heroes, people are people), it goes against what makes Star Wars special (hope and optimism) and Rey is so perfect it is impossible to use her as a role model. If anything, farmboy turned Jedi knight Luke is more ""one of us"" than perfect Mary Sue Rey. Also, I don't need to be told that wars are bad, profiteering is bad and heroes are imperfect, I know that. But I watch Star Wars precisely so I can escape from the grim reality of life, because it is about the triumph of hope and perseverance, because good wins in the end and because there are no grey areas. Characters are powerful archetypes. The themes of family and betrayal are grand. The Last Jedi is a contemporary take on something that is atemporal. Star Wars is epic, motivating and it rings with the same tone of the great tales of old. Those tales bonded communities and made them part of something bigger than themselves. The Last Jedi, in spite of all its poetry, its ambitious themes and its cinematic beauty, achieves the total opposite. It is divisive, annoying, childishly pedagogic and disrespectful with everything that came before. It is great cinema, average story telling and horrible Star Wars.",0.05801898020876125,0.5490073835329312

"What an unbelievable sham of a movie camouflaged by gorgeous art direction. I'll give this movie a single start for just existing and the extra one only for how beautifully rendered it is. And that's about all that's right with this one.
The Force Awakens rode on the hate for the prequels and an overwhelming sense of nostalgia and got by just rehashing the best parts of the erstwhile first 3 movies. What exactly is Rian Johnson's explanation or motivation to turn a decades-old mythology into his personal playground and how pray did Disney go ahead with this? Characters mouth incredulous dialogue (some of it captioning action on the screen), others throw hissy fits, some others decide to sacrifice themselves at the altar of temporary relief to their armies only to be thwarted by others with secret crushes on them. Backstories and plots drawn up in Force Awakens are decimated into smithereens like Alderaan. 
Mark Hamill, bless his hamming soul, is a classic 80s actor - unsubtle, upstages co-performers and clearly guns for longer screen time by slowing down dialogue delivery and throwing in a dozen or so pauses, glares and grimaces. His directors in the original trilogy probably recognised this and so gave him tight, sharp scenes to work with. Rian Johnson succumbs to the fanboy-as-director syndrome and lets Mark do his thing hoping that nostalgia will lull us all into not expecting a performance worthy of a 2017 film. Oscar Isaacs makes up for poor writing by being the film's only hormonal teenager stuck in an adult's body. Daisy Ridley starts and ends the film confused. Adam Driver should consider taking Kylo Ren off caffeine. Carrie Fisher reveals a superpower at the most inopportune moment. At which point, I thought Guardians of The Galaxy might make an appearance. Because by then, we'd already been subjected to some dialogue clearly inflicted by JossWheddonitis.

"Star Wars Fans Beware : If you are a fan of Star Wars lore, canon, and main characters traversing a powerful story arc, be prepared to be epically disappointed. 
Rebellious heroics, compelling unique battle scenes, Luke, Yoda, Chewy, R2 & C3-PO - all unneeded in this the new epoch. The basic tenants of Jedi lore: master/apprentice traditions, humility, purpose, self development - all are deemed unnecessary in this epoch where one girl possesses all of these traits while not having earned even one of them. If you have had enough of compelling real locations, riveting light saber fights, main character development, and memorable side characters, then this is your ticket - as all these are cast aside as well. 
Instead we have a new SW universe where a few strong women lead faceless innocents into obliteration - devoiding the audience of any care of outcome. Having established no connection to us, who really cares if they all die? 
Hours are then filled with reprimanding heroes, pointless coming of age crisis, irrelevant side stories and fizzling love sparks, along with a CGI fest of sleepy battles with predicable outcomes. With only 2 main characters remaining in the film, does anyone really believe some dronelike guards are going to take them out?
The few intriguing characters are gone just as soon as we were drawn to them. 'Snoke', powerful Supreme leader, easily taken out by an errant saber. Benecio del 'DJ ' exhibiting Han Solo like charisma - all the better to banish him in a few quick scenes. Luke went to all the trouble of safely projecting himself holographically (note: holographs can't be killed) only to die from the labor of it. Poe, the one character exhibiting clear heroic struggle was reduced to submissiveness for all his wrong moves - which turned out to be right after all (or was it wrong?). i.e. Had he gone in with fighters (which can also carry bombs as recalled from the destruction of the Death Star) to attack the main Star Destroyer, the rebel cruiser could have escaped without being tracked through hyperspace.
Instead we are dragged through the drama of large ships suddenly inching through space, the far superior enemy force unable to overtake nor flank them - for no reason given (except excruciating plot device). It was as if we were suddenly transported to the 18th century suspense of a ship of the sea taking 3 days to slowly close the gap on a slower sailboat. This epoch chase slogged over an hour of nothingness with no outcome so let's spare all the details which will be suffered by those who still choose to see this film (code: bring a pillow and eye covers).
 
Yet we still have to get to the burning heart of the 4 questions most people have going into this film.
1. What about Luke Skywalker? 2. Who are Rey's parents? 3. Who is Snoke? 4. Will Star Wars VIII The Last Jedi use the Force Awakens as a springboard to greater SW universe expanding cinema? ",0.11913950829045165,0.5660071061014454
"Everyone knows that Star Wars movies are always going to get billions in the box office, no matter how bad the movie is. I feel like Star Wars is now a cash grab from the fans, and I am a fan. The last Star Wars movie that was good was Star Wars: The Force Awakens, in my opinion, and it was in 2015; it's now 2018. I saw some mixed reviews on rotten tomatoes between the audience and the critics, as usual. Personally I'm more on the audiences' side, because I really don't care about the visuals, I care about the story; and let me tell you, the story is trash for a Star Wars movie. And I don't know if it was the director or the writers who screwed up the story. I'm now afraid of what Star Wars movies are going to become; probably a big cash grab, hopefully not to the point as Ghostbusters (2016).

"This movie basically destroyed our childhood memories of what was once an epic story and cinematic experience. We grew up looking up to heroes like Luke and co. Always looking forward to what heroics our heroes would get up to during each movie. Star Wars was truly epic. Episodes 1 - 3 werent as good as 4 - 6 but they did what they needed to which was to tell the early story in the skywalker history. And for that, i still rated them well. Episode 7 was pretty good. Although it was hard to swallow seeing Han Solo getting killed off, it still had some great action, comedy and raised some interesting questions. The Last Jedi however, just threw everything out the door and undid the good platform that Ep7 laid and turned Luke into an idiot, Leia into flying Superwoman, Killed off snoke and added in a mumbo jumbo/pointless plotline.

The trailers have been phenomenal, they got director Rian Johnson to make the movie, and Rey receives her training from Luke Skywalker in this movie. I walked out, feeling like I have been trolled. What I mean by this is that the movie would show glimpses of answering some of our greatest questions that we had after the force awakens, and then would simply shut it down with answer that makes me feel like I wasted my time. Not to mention that the movie in most of its runtime moves at a snail's pace, and when at this pace, it doesn't really pick itself back up. And plus, the movie just goes on for way too long. After everything went down by like the two hour mark I was kind of okay with, but the last half an hour throws this movie in the dirt. There are some ridiculous moments that take place during the second last act that they have and it actually made me angry, the illogic surrounding this film is astounding and it made me want to leave the theater. What really sucks about this movie is the wasted potential too, because there are some moments in this movie where I look at the movie and I just say too myself, ""That could have been done better."" The Last Jedi in my opinion is actually worse than the phantom menace and the only reason why I gave it two stars is that there are three moments in the movie where I actually enjoyed myself.

"I can't believe what I just spent time watching. I am horrified that this is now Star Wars cannon. It was a parody. It mocked meaningful things about Star Wars' lore. Whereas the original movies had funny moments in an overall serious story, this was about poorly turned jokes at every possible moment. It was like watching current day fanboys play at Star Wars. Characters even showed fandom over Luke Skywalker, which was annoying because they are supposed to be part of the Star Wars story too, not outside fans.
So many plot holes, too many jokes and was poorly thought out. All the questions raised in TFA were either not answered at all or made meaningless in this movie. The storyline was not a story at all, nothing moves forward, no character development, nothing to look forward to.
The casino/codebreaker/Rose subplot was ridiculous, felt cheesy and insignificant to the overall story. That whole section was a waste of time and felt more like a Disney teenager movie. Rose ""saving"" Finn towards the end was just plain stupid. The Rose character was irritating and her voice sounded like an animated Disney princess. The purple lady looked more appropriate for The Hunger Games franchise or as a Disney fairygodmother. 
Leia in space, that whole scene, I just can't even... I have no words for that. It was ridiculous. And Luke. They ruined his character. They took what was pure and made it weak and pathetic. What he does with the lightsaber was absolute slapstick. They were calling him a Jedi Master, instead they made him a Jedi fool. I am crushed.
Too many PC messages, it overtook the story. I am a woman, I support feminism. But sometimes a story should just be a story and not used as a forum to convey current PC issues as if it were an after school special for children. There are things to be said about subtlety. 
I feel like they'll probably come out with more information about Rey's parentage in the next movie. I don't believe they'll leave it at this. I think they're trying to do something clever, key word: trying. 
I felt like I was watching a movie of kids having tantrums, of magically being able to do things that others had to work for, of inconsistencies and flakiness, where everything is done irresponsibly and badly but still has a positive ending.

"Truly sad to see Rian Johnson handed a golden egg only to destroy it. This movie is only successful due to the coattails of The Force Awakens. Rian, don't think people like this movie on its own merits. They watch and rate it based upon the charactrs created by JJ Abrams and Kasdan. You created nothing, and ruined a storyline. You benched the most important character Luke, castrated his character, and foolishly killed him off without ever utilizing his potential to make this an epic film. You stole almost every scene you wrote from Empire and ROTJ. The Hoth opening replaced by salt, facing Snoke (Luke and the emperor) Dagobah (the island,which could have worked if done right) everything. You added stupid humor to try to placate Avengers and Guardians fans, throwing the light saber, the Jakku joke, Poe at the beginning sequence of act one. Star Wars is not a cheap flippant comic story but a serious epic with Luke as one of the most serious characters. 
Then you wasted our time with a prequel worthy Jar Jar sequence at the Casino. That whole side story was useless and actually made me angry. Total crap. There should have been one team of writers for the trilogy, bad on you Kathleen Kennedy, you should have known better. But Rian Johnson not only does not deserve his own trilogy, which will undoubtedly be crap, he should become a plumber or a janitor and get out of making films. There is no excuse for this wreck of a film when you were handed a golden goose. You blew the Rey storyline, killed off another great character Snoke, Like Lucas did with Darth Maul who was the only good thing in TPM. And where were the knights of REN? Wow. No battle between Snoke and Luke, no knights of Ren, and Luke dies? Really? I'm not sure someone trying to ruin it could have added worse plot lines and twists. The only thing good was the Rey/Kylo dynamic, which again was created by Abrams and Kasdan. The dark side island scene with Rey was also a useless waste of time. Please stop making movies.

"""The Last Jedi"" is considered the most polarising Star Wars movie ever and is hated quite a bit in the fandom. I've watched this movie at least five times and I've enjoyed it every time. I can comprehend why other people didn't like ""The Last Jedi"" and their points are legit but a lot is due to their own thoughts about Star Wars in the first place. As far as objectivity the movie is very well directed, it looks great and has a great score (John Williams can't miss with this saga). The plot hasn't big issues as long as we forget is Episode VIII of Star Wars. The only problem I have with the movie is that is too long mainly because of the useless Canto Bight subplot that is very bad. The most controversial topic of ""The Last Jedi"" is how Luke Skywalker was handled and I have to admit that I would have liked too to see him as a powerful jedi with insane level of power but I also liked what Rian Johnson did. And this is because I was never a big Luke fan, I've always perceived him as the generic hero that most action films have and as a tool to bring back to the light the real protagonist of the saga: Anakin Skywalker. In giving him this powerful redemption arc with that beautiful scene with Yoda, then projecting himself across the galaxy that requires a special knowledge of the force and becoming the ultimate symbol of hope I grew to love Luke as a character. As I said I can see why for someone his character was ruined but for me it was the opposite. Surely I preferred this version of him that his useless role in Episode IX.
In conclusion ""The Last Jedi"" is polarising and is right to have a personal opinion about it. I personally am on the side that liked it but it's not a sure thing, this movie is a perfect example of not knowing what to expect and whether you'll like it or not.

"Star Wars: Episode VIII- The last jedi, is a good movie. Is not the best of all, but is good, and there are some things that are interesting. Even that the movie is 152 minutes long, it doesn't´t feel that long. I like Episode VII more than this, but this movie feels a little more epic. Rain Johnson is a good director, not only let us see the characters developed in the way they do, but also visually, is stunning. The performances are amazing, specially from Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill, not saying that the other actors are not good, because everyone is great, but Daisy and Mark gave the best performances of their careers in this movie. 
The issues of this movie, at least to me, is that the movie takes some decisions that they were not good for the movie (like the direction of a character, and the fact that the movie could be 20 minutes short) I would love to explore Laura Dern character a little bit more. Also, the movie could use some more dark moments.

First of all thats not how light speed works at the SW universe. Its not going very fast. If it worked like the way that this film showed, the rebels could have done that to the death star or the star killer base etc. So to move on lets just look at the casino scene. What is the point of putting that scene? Its just nonsense and doesnt thrive and help the plot. It just makes the movie 30 mins longer. At the end they return empty handed and that whole casino journey is nonsense. To continue im going to talk about luke. As Mark Hamill says it over 50 times this Luke is not the same Luke from the original trilogy. He is just an old man who sits all day by himself and says jedi needs to end? Even Mark Hamill was shocked after he red the script. He states ""who is this guys? How does the most optimistic guy on the galaxy turns to this old man who says jedi needs to end""
I completely agree with him. To finish this off, this film was 2h30m of nonsense scenes, changing the rules of the SW universe, and completely
destroying the beutufuil story of George Lucas. There is no character development since rey cannot be beaten or have any flaws and she always wins and cannot be stopped. Luke lost and arm while fighting vader for the first time and that time he was kinda trained. But a girl from knowhere beats a sith thats been trained for his whole life. Wow really beliveble. Same with Finn. His main rivalry is between Captain Phasma and he didnt even hasitate to take her down easly in this film. By the way Phasma dies in this film. Before force awakens pahsma was showed off like the new bobba fett. Yea thats cool, she only has 3 minutes of screen time both films included and she dies in this one. This film shows us the rebels are way superior than the first order even with their army of 100 people. Snoke dies, phasma dies, kylo ren is still weaker than rey, they kill luke with the worst death ever. This whole film is a mass from every standing point. Only good scenes was the force connections between Rey and Kylo Ren. Besides that this whole movie is a waste of time. I cant believe that it got 85 metascore. People just cant accept that this is abad movie.",0.08477866904337494,0.47961081402257877

Three major problems:
1- Hollywood formula deployed: all main characters have to be female (except the villains of course). All remakes and reboots and sequels and prequels and reimaginings and bla bla substitute a female for a male.

"I've been letting what I watched last night at the theater sink in so that I could try and come to terms with what was given. I tried see things in a different light so that I could find some enjoyment and hope for the future of the franchise, but it's oh so hard. Let me start by saying that so many of the plot points in this movie were completely useless and wasted. The entire plot-line of Finn and Rose was utterly pointless. Everything they set out to do ended up having no effect whatsoever, and in fact, they ended up making things worse for the Resistance in the end. It was a mess of unnecessary CGI and bad acting to do what exactly? Explore a part of the universe for 25+ minutes to never be talked about again? Or was it to kill off a character that once again provides no substance to the film? They could have cut that entire sequence out and the film would have very likely ended the same. On top of that, we were given the slowest chase sequence in a Star Wars film, that could have ended with some simple hyperspace maneuvering. In addition, the entire interaction with Admiral Holdo and Poe could have gone in such a more interesting direction, but instead, they throw out the whole traitor route, in favor of a simple lack of communication? Hell, they went as far as mutiny for absolutely no reason. And don't even get me started on Snoke. So much wasted potential. Finishing it off, we have one of the worst send-offs in the Star Wars universe for its potentially greatest character. Did I want something different?

We felt that Star Wars reflected reality.
This movie changed EVERYTHING !
It may be trying to write reality the way the new writers see it rather than explore it
And it tries to do so by destroying (in its own words) all that came before, by painting it as ridiculous as they could do their new version could have a shot in comparison",0.10172032828282829,0.5146464646464646
"The eagerly anticipated next chapter in the Star Wars saga; ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" has arrived and it is by far one of the best films in the series and a significant upgrade over ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"". The film picks up where the last film concluded as Rey (Daisy Ridley), has located the long in hiding Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and attempts to recruit him to return to fight the evil First Order and train her in the ways of the Force.
At the same time, the First Order has commenced an assault on the retreating forces of the Resistance and this has caused a rift when key members of the command staff are lost/injured leaving Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) in charge. Her style does not mesh well with the impulsive Poe Damron (Oscar Isaac), and in a move of desperation, he oversees a mission for Finn (John Boyega), and Rose (Kelley Marie Tran), to make a desperate move to allow the forces to escape the relentless assault and pursuit of the First Order.
For many films, the above scenario would be enough to comprise the bulk of the movie but in the case of The Last Jedi, it is simply part of a much larger and far more intricate storyline that is at times much deeper and darker than one would expect from a Star Wars film.
Rey finds Skywalker a broken and bitter man who is consumed with his past failure regarding his Nephew Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), and wants no part of his former glory and praise believing the best thing for the Universe would be for the Jedi to end.
Ren at the same time is a conflicted mess as he is eager to win the approval of his brutal master Snoke (Andy Serkis), while being drawn to Rey who believes he can be redeemed. It is this conflict as well as the tug of war between Snoke, Ren, and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), that shows a much more dynamic and complicated connection between the characters as well as drives home their complexity of their relationships and the situations they find themselves in.
The late Carrie Fisher is captivating as General Leia and her presence lifts the scenes she is in. She portrays Leia with a calm yet feisty and determined edge which shows that she is always in control no matter the situation.
The action in the film comes in waves and when it arrives, it is a wonder to behold as the lavish visuals and complex action sequences are dazzling but unlike the Prequels, never once overwhelm the cast as this is first and foremost a character driven story.
The film does put more of an emphasis on the new characters vs the old, but as this was always the plan, it is nice to see that older characters are not shoved aside or given a token cameo, they are still central to the plot just let the younger cast do more of the heavy lifting, but still get plenty of moments to shine.
Writer/Director Rian Johnson has done a masterful job in crafting a new entry into the series that not only entertains, but gives a deeper and dark look at the universe which makes the film easily one of the best Star Wars films ever made. There are sequences that will delight and surprise fans, and when it was over and I could catch my breath and reflect upon what I had just seen, I found myself saying that I could not have asked for a better sequel as it not only entertained thoroughly, but provided plenty of unexpected moments that makes me all the more anxious to see how the new trilogy concludes in 2019. ""Star Wars"": The Last Jedi"" is the film that fans have been waiting for as it contains all of the best elements of Star Wars and boldly moves the franchise ahead.

If Leia didn't want Po attacking the Dreadnought why did she allow the bombers to follow him in... were they all disobeying orders.. is Leia that bad a leader.
How does Leia get back from space when surely opening the door would have caused all the air to rush out (instead it appeared to rush in)
Why can't some of the First Order fleet jump in front of the fleeing resistance.
How can Finn leave the fleet and come back while its being pursued but the First order ships can't do similar.
Why is Po mutiny necessary, if she had just told him the plan.
Why is Po forgiven for his mutiny, didn't somebody get shot during it.
Can the first order really not detect a fleet of transport craft leaving the Cruiser... does that mean they couldn't detect fighters flying at them as well.
I'm sure there are more that slip my mind.",0.04020833333333334,0.5574305555555557
When the hype surrounding Matrix was out... It was almost too high. The problem was we knew nothing of the Wachowskis and they have only realistically made 2-3 films. The series bombed and the middle and end storylines made absolutely no sense and had no point on getting on the screen. Millions were spent that could have went to better films. I feel that way with Star Wars. It has become more about consuming then the actual product and Im sure Disney execs will tell you that. They knew the product theyd get and sadly theyll milk it until the milk is dry. I dont expect any of the material they put out with this franchise to be any good. I knew it when it was sold to Disney. Maybe at some point... Disney will realize all the material they have needs to appeal to people and not just for consumption purposes. Otherwise great films will be something of the past. Star Wars sadly has become the face of what happened with the Matrix.,0.10955555555555557,0.581925925925926

"Just in case you live under a rock in Jakku. This movie has been rather divisive for audiences, despite the fact, that the visual/special effects from ILM were impressive, the sets & costume were beautiful, the film score by John Williams was amazing, and the action scenes, while, nothing really new, was entertaining enough to get by. Most of the criticism, come from director/writer, Rian Johnson's sharp retelling on the space fantasy mythos. Some examples, being discuss & highly criticize about, is how the sequel does not sync up, well, with the previous movie, 2015's 'Star Wars: Force Awakens' continuous story elements. Fundamentals key points, like Rey (Daisy Ridley)'s journey for closure with her parentage, the disaster-like effects of the Resistance & First Order, losing key battles, like Starkiller Base & Hosnian Prime, and Kylo (Adam Driver)'s quest to kill, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) with his knights of Ren, were downright ignored, talk little about, or turn into 'red herrings'. Even, significant original trilogy (1977's A New Hope, 1980's Empire Strikes Back & 1983's Return of the Jedi) establishment tropes, like powers of light-speed travel & how force projection works, are drastically changed to serve Johnson's vision, thus, become a little more muddled for the fans, on what, characters & vehicles can and cannot do. So, it was no surprised, these changes to the mythos, rub people, the wrong way. For me, I really didn't mind too much, as excessively familiar with no mystery, can led to mediocre rehash writing. Nevertheless, I was a bit disappointed, by certain story beats that the film glaze over, such as how Snoke (Voiced & Motion Capture Performance by Andy Serkis) rose to power, or why the New Republic was so ill-prepared to stop him. You have to go to outside sources to find any information on this. The movie story is not so flesh out. Because of that, it weakened, the last movie and this. Another, frustrating thing about this film is the morality, it's trying to tell. Using examples of unseen forces, playing both sides into conflict: such with the 'on the nose', side-quest filler, through Canto Bight, the burning of the Jedi texts & the scenes onboard Snoke's ship, 'the Supremacy'; its seems that Johnson was going to take, the ultimate risk, by praising something that was good about the prequels (1999's Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith), by exposing how the universe isn't as cookie cutter good vs evil, as the original trios of films make it seems to be. However, it seem like he got cold-feet, and backpedaled, quite a bit, by this adult-driven nihilism approach. In the end, the film play it, safe, by showing yet another kid-friendly coercive persuasion repetition hopeful message. The climax with another naïve generation following in the same footsteps of its forefathers into believing in one ideal symbol, over another; rather than seeing the whole picture; that seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent, was disappointing & somewhat cheesy. I wanted the film to show, that the old-school dualistic dogma thinking about morality is not that fundamental sound; as it only leads to the same tiresome continuous circle of violence. Because of that backpedaling, it kinda ruin any big counterculture beliefs like 'the Grey Jedi' concept; which I felt, would had work, better for these series of films. In short, it makes more sense that the only way, to find balance in the force is to walk the thin line, between the light & the dark. Maybe, producer and director, JJ Abrams would introduce that concept, in the next film. Regardless of that, this movie had other problems, going against it. A great deal of the film is devoted to a fleet chase scene that just wasn't that good of a premise; seeing how the First Order could have ended it, just by calling another fleet to interception the Resistance fleet during hyperspace travel, but whatever. The film had to go somewhere, even those sequences led only to more awkward & pointless filler doesn't really connect much, with what's happening on Ahch-To. Although, as much as the movie suffer from pacing issues; at least, most of the acting in the movie is good enough, to overlook it. Ridley as Rey was commanding in her role. Unlike some fans, I wasn't really bothered by how the picture portrayed Skywalker, as grumpy bitter old man/ teacher. Hamill was good in that type of a role. Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa, on the other hand, felt a bit wasted, & misused. It's sad that this will be her last role. All people will remember from her in this movie is the 'Shooting Star' meme. As for Driver, he brings a certain gravitas to Kylo Ren that makes the character, one of the most interesting villain, in a long time. A fine good job from him. With John Boyega as Finn, I found him, less annoying in this, than the last movie. Boyega is enjoyable. Plus, he does have better comedy chops than Oscar Isaac, as Poe Dameron, ever had. Any jokes fed to Isaac felt force and awkward. As for supporting characters like Kelly Marie Tran, she never really deserve the racist attacks from some Star Wars fans who were dissatisfied with her character. She was alright, as newcomer, Rose Tico. Once again, I was somewhat disappointed with Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) & felt that, Benicio Del Toro & Laura Dern were wasted in their roles, as well. As for the cameos, I like all of them. Overall: I somewhat enjoy the film even with its flaws. It was still an entertaining popcorn flick, worth going to. Nevertheless, films like this, are starting to feel more and more like a postmodern experience. While, the spirit of repetition doesn't sit lightly for some viewers, this movie brings enough nuance to the table to stand on its own. So seek it out. It's a force to reckon with.",0.10989287548609583,0.5141651992075725

But somehow it fell flat on its face, to say that this was a great movie would be a crime against humanity! J.J. Abrams lifted Star wars out of the prequels so it could become something better. But Rian Johnson kicked it back into the DIRT! The first act was good, I was engaged and excited... Untilllll Leia, who somehow learned how to use the force suddenly saved her self from death. That brought me out the movie! Then it regained my interest, everything was going great, the tension was building up, the plot was falling into place. Rey goes to Snoke, we get a couple minutes of Snoke torturing Rey, then asked Kylo to kill her. What does Kylo do!? Turns a lightsaber besides Snoke on to CUT HIM IN HALF! Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea!? After that, you think Kylo was done with the dark side but nooooooo. He goes right back and becomes the new supreme leader. And Rey, she just helps her friends and is exactly where she was at the end of the last movie. Luke was the worst tragedy of this film by far, he goes out by using the force to have a force hologram thing show up in the battle to distract Kylo. After that, he dies! WTF!!!!!

The story between Holdo and Poe was weird I thought. Why she couldn't just tell him she had plan is weird. And Finally Luke's Death. The scene was done very well but to me it just didn't feel justified. Had they waited to the final film then it might have been better. But depending on how he is used in The Rise of Skywalker, I might change my mind on this. As of what's good, I enjoyed everything with Luke and Rey and I didn't mind how Luke was in the Film.

"It's easy enough to feel conflicted about this film.

Well, not that it was entirely unexplained, because Snope claimed he was responsible. I feel a little better following a second viewing of the film, as captioning helped overcome some difficulty with the dialog in the theater. But near the end of the picture there's a scene in which Ren is trying to turn Rey to the dark side, and he says ""Let the past die. Kill it if you have to."" It's as if that was Disney's and director Rian Johnson's message to Star Wars fans who have been with the franchise from the beginning. The treatment of Luke Skywalker still bothers me somewhat, as he seemed awfully out of character compared to the young hero of ""A New Hope"". I get it that he had feelings of failure over the Kylo Ren situation, but he should have seen it from Rey's point of view right from the outset.

"1. Poe: Prank call to the Huks; childish. Then a single fighter - one fighter - manages to get through and cause major damage to this ""dreadnaught"". Later, just one bomber destroys the indestructible ship by ""dropping"" bombs in zero gravity. Riiiight. Poe mutinies, and is undone. All is forgiven because, well, he's a major character. Oh, and BB8 can do anything. Anything!
2. Huks acts like the befuddled owner of Moe's Bar rather than the commander of a fleet. His military abilities are nil. Only after Poe attacks does the fleet launch their own fighters? They aren't ready to attack the moment they come out of light speed? For the final battle, rebels line up in a trench in front of the door - so he lines up as well as interminable time is taken to drag the cannon into place? He has air dominance then - but not a single fighter strafes the trench? 
3. Rey - Who is she? No one. But she has some Jedi mind-link to Kylo. She can do anything without any training, well because. The trip to the dark hole with the infinity mirror served absolutely no purpose.
4. Luke Skywalker has been reduced to shambling hermit. He's grumpy and uninteresting. (""You kids get off my island."") Light saber tossed, alien walrus milked, cuty porgs introduced for marketing. How did the hologram actually fight Kylo, sword to sword? Hamill hasn't acted in some time, and it showed.
5. Yoda - Why?
6. The slow motion, film-filling chase scene was ridiculous. ""Their ships are too quick."" Again?! No one thought to make a very quick jump to light speed to get ahead of the rebels.

7. The casino planet was totally unneeded. The nameless breaker (a 1% arms dealer) is identified, but while they can't get to him they happen to be locked up with an even better choice, the grauitously cast Benicio Del Toro. He pops them out and solved their problems with the help of some indestructible riding beasts. Except he didn't and made things worse for he rebels. (With all those arms dealers, why haven't the X-wing and Tie fighters been upgraded in 30 years?)
8. Finn and Rose serve no purpose - except for diversity points! Speaking of, note that the First Order is all white and nearly all male but the rebels are so diverse (including aliens) to defy all logic. The two can operate any equipment available, and survive two major crashes with no explosions. That the giant door was open just long enough for them to fly in with no one expecting them was ridiculous. Was there supposed to be some romantic chemistry here? Nope, everyone loves each other like siblings.
9. Leia - She gets blasted into space but flies back and is her (very) old self in no time. Meanwhile, gratuitously cast admiral Laura Dern shows up in a gown with a neck like a crepe column to lead things. Diversity, with Poe giving the qualifying observation. She has a plan but won't tell anyone. That's leadership! Later her plan is revealed but ""someone has to stay behind."". Why? Surely these ships cannot be run by a single person. Oh, that's right so she can do something dramatic and unexpected. If running a ship at light speed is as devastating as shown, you'd think light-speed based impact weapons would exist.
10. Phasma - How did she survive? Who cares? She came back just to get snuffed by underling Finn. So glad we got to see her one eye.
11. All the transports run to a convenient old Rebel base that's somehow safe. Nearly every ship gets picked off before they get there. Great plan.
12. Snoke - Who is he? How did he accomplish all that he did? No answers, just a you-see-it-coming death after delivering the typical villain speech.",0.00875043767507003,0.5625974556489263

"I watched episode 7 and loved it. I watched Rogue One during the in-between wait for the next episode, and loved it. So, after waiting 2 years for episode 8...here's come a great one...highly anticipated Rey's training, Ren's completion to the Dark Side, some epic fights between them, with Master Luke's fight as well...and Satan-liked Snork's epic appearance...
Crap...Firstly, Rey hardly has any training from the great Skywalker. All Skywalker teach her is about feeling the force, and sort of introduced her to the Dark Side???2ndly, Ren never got to complete his training...all he got is more insult from his Master. 3rdly, We never get to see Snork's epic battle with the last Jedi...he was killed before we can get to know more of him.

That doesn't mean it's without flaws, and I'm sorry if you felt it violated esoteric elements of Star Wars cannon, but get over it. Compared to the Force Awakens, this was absolutely fantastic, especially in that it did new things vs. making a hash out of old themes. Things moved forward. Characters were developed, new locations were seen, old characters gave strong performances (Mark Hamill has learned to act!). Weak or has-been characters were removed. (yes sorry at some point everyone in the original trilogy has to die!) Sorry. Don't be a baby about it. The script is well thought out. The dialog flows and is witty. We learn new things and they improve some old things. Yes there are a few cheap plot devices but please realize they existed in the old movies as well.

"I am a Star Wars fan who grew up in the late 70s and 80s watching the original trilogy. I am also a fan of cinematic brilliance overall.

These are all highly acclaimed true greats of cinema. They are works of art and created with genius skill so their quality far outshines whatever tiny flaws there might be. The Last Jedi similarly is not perfect but its qualities, in my opinion far outshine any imperfections.

"Following the Force Awakens which was both a critical and fan hit, Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi had the highest bar to climb, and it manages to go a lot higher than the its predecessor. Rian Johnson's touch has elevated The Star Wars franchise by daring to take risks, and taking our beloved characters to a new level. 
This is a unique Star Wars film in its story telling aspects, in its humor, and in its style. This will drop as many jaws as I assume The Empire Strikes Back originally did. This is also the most beautiful Star Wars movie to date, with breathtaking Cinematography, Fight Choreography and Visual Effects. But Most importantly, all of these technical aspects are only there to elevate the gripping story and character arcs that Johnson has created. 
The Last Jedi is absurdly entertaining, gripping, and is also a mind bender. It will trick you, confuse you and ask you questions, only to pay them off and answer them in the most surprising and satisfying way possible. None of the main characters are one sided, as Rian Johnson manages to make you feel empathy for all of its characters, specially the main Villain, Kylo Ren. He remains a strong antagonist who is conflicted, but driven and you could say the same about our hero, Ray. Luke Skywalker is handled masterfully, and that's all I can say about him without going to spoilers. So much happens with him that is surprising, but fitting to his character. Mark Hammill shines bright, but the brightest star is the Late Carrie Fisher, as General Leia. It is difficult not to feel emotional every time you see her on the screen. She plays her iconic character as well as ever, and could not be in a better movie as her last. 
The Last Jedi has grand emotional gut punches, followed by great action sequences, including my all-time favorite _and for a lack of a better fitting word the most Badass_ scene in the franchise. However just like any film it has its flaws and I can summarize my main problem with the movie in one word: Porgs. These cute birds are only there to be adored and are only there so Disney can sell Toys, which we know brings a surprisingly large amount of revenue to the studio. In Contrast to the Porgs, I loved the cute droid BB_8 because he as so much purpose and he is vital in the story. The story also loses some of its emotional build up in one particular heavy scene towards the end, to throw in a joke which felt forced and unnecessary. Happily these two minor complaints get lost in this fantastic story. This is truly a great film, and you don't have to be a Star Wars fan to love it. Rian Johnson's different vision for this movie, has made me a lot more optimistic about the future of Star Wars, and his original trilogy.",0.2770492494518469,0.5881542699724519

"Usually I am rather passive when it comes to browsing through the pages of IMDB, but this film made me feel obliged to create an account and leave a review on this film.
As a casual Star Wars fan, not one of those crazy superfans that his franchise has, some of which I had the pleasure of sharing the theatre with i assumed as their howls rang out over the opening credits, but nonetheless, i went in with mild excitement but also i was aware that director Rian Johnson was once one of those crazy superfans that felt it necessary to howl over the titles so all in all i was hoping for success but expecting disappointment. and as i walked out, disappointment was an understatement.
I believe that because of Rians love for the franchise, he felt so much pressure to get it right and do the trilogy the service it deserves, that that ultimately he crumbled under the pressure, but he was not the sole reason for the disappointment.
The ensemble put together was a mixed bag of over rated and under appreciated actors which performed accordingly.
John Boyega has evidently lost his appeal ever since being exposed to the world of police brutality from his role in Detroit and is clearly prioritizing being Idris Elba's son in Pacific Rim 2. Daisy Ridley's acting skill and ability to show true emotion was the actual thing to be murdered on the Orient Express. Adam Drivers time as a Portuguese priest in Silence didn't give him enough of a chance to control his inconsistency in living up to his potential and Domhnall Gleeson was as usual under apprecitaed in his role as General Hux, I now hope he doesn't have those god awful side burns in either Goodbye Christopher Robin or Peter Rabbit. 
All in all, Star Wars - The Last Jedi was a film that was a mixture of embarrassing script writing and unnecessary nonsense put in there exclusively for the Rian Johnson's of the world, combined with little moments of happiness and enjoyment.

Bad stuff: (we'll go past the alphabet so i'll just list) incoherent plotting, stories just petered out, dialogue was typical George Lucas wooden, the whole set with the main evil dude looked like a Busby Berkeley dance musical set, super ""high Dungeon"" super silly, I was waiting for the guards to burst into song and dance. Also, jesus, the main evil dude was Sauron powerful, all seeing, knowing, wise-evil, no one/nothing has a chance against him yet he's undone by the laser sword trick, (where is Maxwell Smart when you need him?) And the acting....OMG, Mark Hamill sucks, I love(d) Carrie Fischer, but she can't act either. And why was Laura Dern in the movie? Her hair, hope she got paid a lot lot. What about the whole tracking through light speed travel plot thing, the whole battering ram cannon anti climax, how did this movie get made.

"I will never understand the bad word of mouth with the last Star Wars outing, The Last Jedi. There's no going wrong with this franchise as far as I can see. In my honest opinion, Rouge One wasn't as good as The Force Awakes but after watching The Last Jedi, I will say it is one of the best. This gives me reason to question why people are going out of the way to bash what is being done with the Star Wars series. ",0.13333333333333336,0.5074074074074074
"The Last Jedi is seen as the most controversial Star Wars film to date, splitting Star Wars fans down the middle and emphasizing the toxicity of the Star Wars fandom. The Last Jedi acts as the eighth installment in the Skywalker Saga, and despite protests and signed petitions of fans, is going to stay that way.
The Last Jedi picks up right where The Force Awakens ends, a first for a Star Wars film. The films centers around Rey being trained in the ways of the force by Luke Skywalker, while the resistance flees from the first order's powerful fleet. As Rey travels to The Supremacy to turn Kylo Ren to the nightside, Finn and newcomer Rose to a chance of finding a ""master codebreaker"" to weaken the first orders hold on the resistance fleet and provide a chance of escape. The film ends with a battle between the massive first order army and the few remaining members of the resistance.
This film includes the best performances of the sequel trilogy. Daisy Ridley, Oscar Issac, and John Boyega all take their characters first introduced in the previous film and gives them new meaning, but the strongest performance comes from Adam Driver's portrayal of Kylo Ren. Rian Johnson took the quiet and monotoned villain that delivers no emotion hiding behind his mask and gives him intense and brutal scenes, really diving into the character and giving him more worth in the trilogy.
The cinematography of The Last Jedi is some of the best of the saga, easily separating it from the other films. Even those who aren't fans of the film can agree on the beauty that Rian Johnson was able to create. I will never forget when each story is at its climax and Commander Holdo uses her ship's hyperdrive to erupt through The Supremacy. Another example of the beauty this film generates takes place on the planet Crait. The resistance is flying their ski speeders towards the first order army in a perfect line, shooting the red planet surface into the air. The whole planet of Crait is very satisfying to watch with the white surface being splattered with red, every blast, every step, every track of a vehicle is being recorded on the planet surface.
One of the biggest issues the fans have with The Last Jedi is how Luke Skywalker was written. It's argued that the character is ruined in how he has run away and cut himself off from the force. What people don't seem to understand is that Luke's story didn't finish with Return of the Jedi. Luke's fear and ,mistakes prove that he isn't the legend the galaxy saw him as, but a human, like everyone else. Luke's character is redeemed by the end of the film, as he sacrifices himself to save the resistance. Fans wanted Luke to come back and just save the day with an epic lightsaber fight, but that wouldn't have progressed the story in any way. They complained The Force Awakens was too similar to the original trilogy and they complained that this film was too different. Luke already saved the galaxy in the original trilogy and now it was time for the new characters to have their story.
Another interesting aspect Episode 8 showed was the fall of Ben solo. Ryan Johnson showed this event through multiple points of view, giving the viewers a little mystery of who to believe and how the event actually went down. It's argued that it is completely unlike Luke to strike down Ben Solo in fear, and that's 100% true, Luke even knew it and that's why he couldn't kill his nephew. This gives meaning to Luke going into exile as he was ashamed by himself. Through these flashback sequences, we are able to learn more of why Kylo Ren turned and what makes him the person he is.
One of the coolest features of The Last Jedi are the scenes that highlight the force bond of Rey and Kylo Ren. These scenes of them speaking to each other in different locations are unlike anything we've seen before, and further the tension between the two. Kylo is certain he can turn Rey to the dark side and Rey is certain she can do the opposite with him. They are both being seen exactly what they want, and proves just how manipulative Snoke really is.
Snoke is another reason the movie receives so much whiplash by the fans is because Snoke is killed off before we can learn more about who he is and how he rose to power. People had no problem with Palpatine being killed in the original trilogy. Similarly to Smoke, it was only his second movie and we knew nothing about him. We later learn all about him in the prequels, and we even get to learn about Snoke in the Rise of Skywalker and we might even get more secrets uncovered in time to come. Just like Palpatine, Snoke's story is far from finished, and I am certain more will be uncovered as more Star Wars projects are made.
When it comes to the massive controversy surrounding The Last Jedi, there are many fingers being pointed at who should be taking the blame. Rian Johnson? Kathleen Kennedy? It is clear that the real blame is held with the fans. The fanbase has grown so toxic that no matter how amazing a film The Last Jedi could've been, it's impossible to please everyone, and with technology and social media at an all time high, those who aren't please we have no fear in sharing their opinion. This resulted in multiple actors going off of social media, the fanbase becoming split and even future Star Wars projects being cancelled.
The Last Jedi is the most debated and controversial film in the saga, and while certain parts of the plot are weak, the overall story, stunning performances, visual and audio effects, and magnificent score by John Williams quickly turn the film round into a complex and enjoyable ride for the audience. I am giving Star Wars: The Last Jedi a 7.8/10.",0.15698612060454162,0.4175776562618668

"Saw the movie twice in the cinema. After seeing it a first time and feeling very underwhelmed, I went back to see if there was something I was missing. The ""critics"" were raving about this brilliant reinvention of Star Wars. Nope. The movie is pseudo-intellectual, postmodern garbage. 
Ryan Johnson has to be the most overrated director in Hollywood. It is like he wanted to show everyone how smart he was by unravelling the longstanding use of Joseph Campbell's hero motif in Star Wars story telling. 
Yes, visually movie excels. But peel past this veneer and you will discover that the plot meanders, the scripting sucks, the character arcs are regressive, and the film is out of kilter with previous Star Wars films, including its immediate predecessor the Force Awakens. Even if JJ Abrams left an inconvenient bunch of ""mystery boxes"" such as who are Rey's parents and why did she have visions when she touched Luke's original blue light-saber, just cant pretend they weren't there or dismiss them. 
Worse of all, courtesy of Johnson Luke Skywalker has been reduced from hero to loser. 
Why? Because according to Johnson everything is contextual. There is no real good or evil. If, like Luke Skywalker, you hang around long enough you will realise that the hero's journey is pointless and what is old becomes new again. So the inevitable option is to give up.
Confusingly however Rey becomes some kind of hero without ever really earning the right. How does she become a jedi master with almost no training. Particularly if she is a ""no body""?
This is not a renewal of the franchise. Even ignoring its unnecessary inclusion of antifa politics, the film's ""let the past die"" philosophy is is an arrogant and disrespectful junking of tradition and the many fans bought up on Star Wars pop culture.

Since the prequels, people have been crying that there was too much revealed, and not enough mystery, as there had been with the originals.

He transcended the genre while giving it nostalgia but making it his own. The Last Jedi is one of my favorite Star Wars films ever. Arguably one of the best from the originals as well.

"There's a good movie there somewhere - just not in the context of the 8th installment of a 9 part ""saga"". I fail to see any real chances taken in the story here. The main overarching event in this movie is a standard space battle whose only unique trait is that it stalls out for 3/4 of the movie as one side waits for the other to run out of fuel. Then we have the precocious young Jedi leave the old master against his wishes before the training is complete (as we do in Episode V). She then valaunteers herself to the enemy where the little bad guy kills the big bad guy while the big bad guy has the heroine defenseless (as we do in Episode VI). The big bad even taunts the heroine with the sight of her fleet being decimated like we see in Episode VI. Then the old master distracts the little bad guy and turns into a ghost as the good guys get away (Episode IV). As for the subversion- if I say ""knock knock"" to someone and they respond with ""who's there"" and then I punch them in the stomach - I have subverted expectations. It doesn't make for much of a knock-knock joke though. Episode 7 poses a question like ""who is Snoke?"" Episode 8 answers with ""dead"". Episode 7 asks ""who are Rey's parents?"" Episode 8 answers with ""no one"". Episode 7 ends with a single shot of Luke Skywalker who had been sought out by every character in the film. He was only able to be found because he left a map in case he was needed while he sought the ancient Jedi texts. What new knowledge did those texts hold? What has he been doing? Episode 8 answers with ""he didn't read them"" and ""he's been waiting to die"". Sure these are all unexpected, but the reductive nature of these answers are the opposite of brave story telling. They refuse to push the story threads any further along and paint the overarching plot into a corner. There are moments where this film gets interesting but all of the grey morality and ""deconstruction"" gets walked back by the end. Had Rey taken Kylo Ren's hand after he killed Snoke....THAT would have been subversive. THAT would have brought the audience to a place of unpredictability and novelty. Instead we are left in the same predictable space with one less bad guy. The only one that remains (Kylo) has already been beaten clean by Rey in the first lightsaber duel of her life.

"Star Wars would have been better off if Disney just didn't make any more films...
The first in this franchise to forcibly eject itself out of what made the franchise so great. Star Wars was and has continued to be, up until this film, kept set apart and a shining example of an ongoing tale that spoke into our condition as humans by being secondly, a science fiction movie series and firstly, an opera in every classical sense minus singing, set on a wider literary canvas of space and technology and magic. Setting precedent for all future Star Wars films, this is no longer the case. Star Wars, according to Disney's new iteration in the hands of Ryan Johnson is and should forever be simply a sweeping science fiction epic, rife with space battles, new imaginative monsters and planets and irrelevant plot lines whose irrelevance are buried beneath the glitz of newness and the unexpected - however trite or insulting these ""new"" or ""unexpected"" things may be. 
Short of beginning with the classic Star Wars crawl that read something like, ""The following movie will minimize, insult, or make moot everything you have come to care about in this series"", Ryan Johnson did just that. 
No more characters you have come to love, some for over thirty years.
No more character development.
Welcome new characters who you have no reason to care about do heroic things that the characters you love died before being able to do themselves.
Be led to hope in countless scenarios only to be shown after long story arcs that they were irrelevant to the plot, characters, franchise, and story in every possible way.
Watch 2017esque shrugging leadership, non communication for no reason, and smug humor replace the 80s sense of commitment, camaraderie, character, and resolve.
Before your very eyes The Last Jedi makes the past films shallow and meaningless.
According to the new ""developments"" with regards to the force, the jedi, and all conflict previously won at high cost, the entire original series films (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi) are pointless now. There is no reason why anything in any of these movies that we cheered for when we first saw them even happened. At least according to The Last Jedi.
If Ryan Johnson secretly hated J.J. Abrams, this movie would make way more sense. The way he destroyed any and all continuity from The Force Awakens would have been the perfect insult for someone who did such a tremendous job with that film and who is slated to have to end the entire 9 part saga.

"I will apologise up front that review writing is not my forte but I tried of people telling me why I had to like The Last Jedi and I was the one holding on to the past if I didn't agree.
Did the Empire win at the end of Episode 6? It does feel that way when it comes to TFA and TLJ. 
Understandably for Star Wars it had to evolve. However instead of developing story lines with generations working together, it is out with the old and in with the new. So my question is why do beloved character have to be pushed aside and made to look bad, instead there are still- stormtroops, deathstar weapons, star destroyers and tie fighters? 
This movie for me was boring as the 1st Order leaders are more of a parody of the old Empire. While the actors do their best they don't have the presences of the previous cast on screen and appear to have a delusions of grandeur (which happens when Solo is out of the picture) . 
Rey still looking like a deer in the headlights, gets out of every predicament so much so that in TLJ, they didn't show how she did one escape, 
Phasma is more like a classic Battlestar Cylon and just as useless.
On the subject of Battlestar, the rag tag fleet with little fuel pursued by the enemy, I remember when George Lucas sued Glen Larson over BSG being a copy of Star Wars, now SW is using BSG for story ideas. Couldn't they find a story line from their own expended universe?
The Force now offers super powers but is useless for soul searching and clarity.
There are a lot of throw back lines that feel forced. The humour was very poor with most jokes falling flat and should not be compared to the Marvel or POTC movies as isn't that funny
On the subject of Pirates did Disney throw it under a bus to get the critics to say that The Last Jedi was fresh? Pirates was far more original as The Last Jedi is a mashup of Battlestar Galactica, Empire and Jedi.
Star Wars was the Skywalker adventures seen through the eyes of two droids, who have also been replaced by a cute SUPER droid and in TFA and Episode 9 neither Anikan or Luke are or will be the lead character.
Everyone blames Disney for this mess but it is Lucas Film that is at fault as there seems to be little project management as they allow egotistical writer/director full control and they appear more interested in pushing their ""their characters"" and not considering the flow of the entire saga. 
One last thing, Yoda who has put on weight since he died, is just as powerful in the living world. So does that open the door to the Return of the Jedi (plural) to finish the saga? If so that will be the only way to clear up this mess.

"I have been a Star Wars fan from day one. The summer of 1977 when, begging my parents who begrudgingly allowed me to see Episode 4, 17 times proved that. That film was incredible as were the next two that followed. Honestly, I wish they had left it there at this point. Force Awakens was okay, Rogue One was pretty darn good, but this. Ugh. Welp, finally saw The Last Jedi thanks to Netflix. I'm so very glad I didn't spend $15 for a ticket to see it. While it had a few moments here and there, so much was beyond plot holes you could fly an Imperial Cruiser through. Sudden Force powers unknown in any previous film, space resurrection of a princess and about 45 minutes of footage of useless nonsense totally unrelated to the plot that should have been left on the cutting room floor are just a few of the bits of nonsense. My biggest issue with this film is the poor storytelling. When did people forget how to tell a story? Especially a Star Wars story? I'm not even gonna bother with Solo. There are only three Star Wars films that I can honestly watch over and over. Ep 4, 5, and 6, unbloody touched. The one thing that made Last Jedi feel like a real Star Wars film though was John William's score. That was amazing as usual and demonstrates that Mr. Williams is the true Jedi Master of these films.",0.13333333333333336,0.5241935483870968
"I don't think the last Jedi is the worst movie of all time. I don't think it's the worst Star Wars movie of all time. But it is just painfully average. Rian Johnson has repeatedly stated that he made the film according to his own vision, disregarding what the fans wanted. Watching the movie, this is so clearly not true that the idea is laughable. It's pretty obvious that Johnson made this movie not with the intent of following his own vision, but with the intent of purposefully ignoring what the fans wanted. There is no problem with ignoring what the fans want when making sequels or movies within a universe, and making a movie with your own creative vision. A problem does arise however when a film is made solely to subvert expectations and disregard what fans want. This movie is the definition of wheel spinning. Over the course of the plot things happen sure, but the movie itself has a sense of weightlessness in its treatment of consequences for its actions. The movie is about failure. When Poe fails, he gets the resistance bombers wiped out. This leads to his demotion and launch of a secret mission to get a code breaker. When this mission fails, it leads to the death of 80% of the resistance fleet. Yet by the end of the movie, Poe, Finn and Rose face no consequences for their actions. Poe is even set up to become the leader of the resistance in the next movie following Carrie Fishers untimely death. The movie contains failure aplenty, yet the movie itself fails to derive any meaningful character development from this failure. ",-0.060999999999999985,0.5862222222222223
"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi was a severe disappointed. A two year wait and anticipation was wasted with missed opportunities and plain bad writing. 
Because so many things are awful and made no sense at times, I'll start with what I did like. 
The special effects didn't disappoint. They were of Stars Wars quality and then some. Great colour throughout the film. 
The opening sequence of where the Resistance is evacuating their base was awesome. Beautiful action sequence and well done. There was one problem where a bomber released its bombs and the movie completely forgets the laws of gravity but I'll ignore this since there's not supposed to be any sound in space. 
Lightsaber battle between Rey, Kylo and Snoke's elite guards was another high point in the movie and should have had a lot more lightsaber battles. Remember it's a Star Wars movie guys. 
Now for all the bad. 
Humour was overly used and made power characters look like fools, namely General Hux. 
Cat and mouse game between the Resistance and the First Order was tremble. A sequence that should have been 10 minutes lasted three quarter of the movie. Bad script and writing. 
The Canto Bight scenes burn my eyes. How this sequence got green lighted is beyond me. The movie could have completely done without this part. Benicio del Toro, a talented actor got completely wasted. 
And speaking about wasted characters, nearly all was put to extremely poor use whilst others were completely wasted. Wasted ones include Supreme Leader Snoke, Captain Phasma, Finn, Rose, Leia and Luke. 
This whole movie was to deal with Luke Skywalker as he is now and training Rey to be the future. His character was a complete 180 from what he once was. His character was not done justice at all. But his performance was still great to watch despite the bad story and is still probably the best part of the movie.
The great Leader of the First Order was a complete joke in this movie. The set-up was great in the last movie which was to pay off in this and in the future film but like so many things that were set up by the last movie the director of this one just flush it all down the toilet. 
This movie as a standalone would be considered a good one but completely abandoning the set up from the last one made this movie suffer immensely and is probably the worse in the franchise. Bad writing and storytelling from director Rian Johnson has sealed this. What Kathleen Kennedy was thinking when this script was green lighted is beyond me.

The employees and some fans were wearing Star Wars uniforms and everyone in the theater cheered when the movie started. I was blown away by the film and just wanted more after it.
I loved that the film took a different direction with characters and events that really left me in awe with the surprises that were in store. The best parts were with Rey, Kylo, and Luke. If the movie had more time spent in these 3 more, I would probably give this movie a 10. Of course, the other characters besides them weren't as good but they were ok. Rey and Kylos dynamic was so good and I loved that they introduced force bonds like in Knights of the Old Republic.
Please if you hate this movie for dumb or childish reasons, you can suck it! This is probably my favorite of the Sequel Trilogy and I hate that stuff that was built up in this movie got squandered in The Rise of Skywalker like Rey being a nobody.

This new part is the longest but the movie never drags or stalls and what's more, a very healthy intake of breezy humor adds a very strong element to this tightly-knit fabric of a plot. 
Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher - to name the few - do a very spellbinding and jaw-dropping work, and what's again very cool and decent, they are shown as real people, with weak spots, doubts, hopes, hesitations, panic, fear, terror and strength. Much has been written about Kylo Ren's battle with his own Dark Side, so no new thing must be added, but this very struggle is a truly breathtaking edge-of-the-seat holder all through this excellent film. Large and very clever parts played by Hamill, Fisher and Ridley also never let us down, and every time any of our beloved characters appear on the screen, we feel delighted to see them alive and kicking and going on their uneasy but deserved and rewarding paths. 
Awesome CGI, heart-wrenching deaths, intrepid feats, daredevil space battles add a huge portion of awe and excitement. And then, a beauty of the nature as well as very strong music put new pieces of mosaic thus building a mesmerizing kaleidoscope of thriller and food for thought.
This is a very welcomed new part of a large mechanism, and so many hints were dropped, new bridges to a fresh episode were built that we now have to take a deep breath and pluck up all our patience awaiting a new film.

"'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is a brilliant and unique addition to the well-loved franchise, and could very well possibly be one of the best. I had the privilege of attending the midnight premiere screening of this film, which was undoubtedly one of the best cinema experiences I've had. Hosted by Star Walking, the longest running Star Wars fan club worldwide, this film was accompanied by constant applause and cheering from an audience of over 700 individuals. Many of them being dressed up in remarkable costumes, the overall atmosphere was full of excitement, apprehension and joy, and made the premiere a great experience.
Now, onto the actual film. Sequels always have a high chance of being a disappointment, as they usually do not live up to its predecessor and never feel as fresh or enjoyable. Director Rian Johnson had huge shoes to fill in creating this film, and not only did he not disappoint and stayed very true to the franchise, but he also made a Star Wars film that has it's own unique and refreshing style. Johnson's directing style is quite different to previous directors in the franchise that ultimately sits well. When combined with a well-paced storyline that is full of many plot twists and complex underlying themes, you end up with a flawless film. The casting in this film is great, with a mix of diverse actors that all portray their characters exceptionally well. Notable highlights go to Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Laura Dern who's talent shines throughout this film. Adam Driver's performance was also very well-done and had certainly improved from the previous film. An honourable mention also goes to the late Carrie Fisher who played the role of Princess Leia for the last time and did an exceptional job.
One of the best things about this film is the fact that it is so visually striking. With breathtaking locations, wonderful fantasy creatures, elaborated costume design and striking cinematography by Steve Yedlin, this film is a delight to look at. The action scenes in this film left the entire audience in awe of its visual appeal and overall execution. The score in this film was as great as ever, by longtime Star Wars composer John Williams, and certainly contributed significantly to the film. The humour was frequent and brilliant, producing genuine laughter throughout the whole cinema, and did not have an effect on the serious side of the film which was certainly emotional in several parts.

"So, the beloved Star Wars saga has reached the eighth chapter and now continues the story with our heroes battle against the diabolical First Order. After making a warm welcome back with 'The Force Awakens' in 2015, the Star Wars franchise has made a remarkable recovery from the damper left by the botched prequel trilogy launched by the hands of George Lucas. Although The Force Awakens was a flawed chapter as it drew more than enough parallels to 'The New Hope', it marked a significant turning point in the saga. The Last Jedi, directed by Rian Johnson of films such as 'Brick' and the hit time-traveling sci-fi piece 'Looper', is a heartwarming spectacle full of just about everything you desire in a Star Wars movie: killer special effects, compelling expansion of the characters, heart-pounding twists, and a story bursts with near endless excitement from beginning to end. This film strikes at the heart of the franchise with a strong emotional magnitude that keeps you growing hungry for more as it leaves you questioning nearly everything. What is all gonna come down to? And don't worry, this review will be restrained to a spoiler-free frontier. But if you prefer to go in completely blind, just go see the movie and come back later. So, Princess Leia (played by Carrie Fisher) is the now the commander of the Resistance as they continue their fight against the First Order headed by Snoke (played by Andy Serkis). Ex-Stormtrooper Finn (played by John Boyega) has awaken from his coma and escapes with fellow resistance warrior Rose (played by Kelly Marie Tran) on a conquest to foil the First Order. Meanwhile, Resistance fighter Rey (played by Daisy Ridley) is stranded on an island where he encounters the estranged Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill) who he must convince her in battle to settle the score with his nephew Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver).

12. Rose is the worse character in ALL OF STAR WARS. The scenes with her made me cringe (talked about punching a hole through the town, saving what we love etc).
13. BB8 saving the day with an at-st. I am sure they talked about giving him force abilities too.
14. Only 2 scenes were enjoyable, the beggining of the movie where Poe attacks the Dreadnought, and the Praetorian Guard fight had great potential

The Story between Rey, Luke and kylo ren is amazing and so interesting. What you Learn about the characters motivation and desire is so fascinating, And how people can change after time. The cinematography and cgi is top notch, and looks way better than most marvel movies. It's not a flawless movie. The things I don't like is the entire rose and Finn subplot that just panders out the time and ruins the pacing and canto bight sequence (F#ck canto bight). The chase between the first order and resistance is not the most creative plot and kinda adds some plot holes. But overall I love this movie and I could watch it again and again.

Yes, the list of valid complaints is very long, but I'll keep it to 6 times where they had a story to tell and took the dumb path - the path lacking intellect - which is an insult to any audience.
1-you're trying to fix a circuit board in a ship and you do so by smashing your head into it and breaking it? This failed attempt at comedy was but one of many examples of the complete lack of basic intellect throughout this film.
2-The bombers all fly close together. One is hit - they all blow up. Was this their first time? So what if other planes have had that formation - that's a dopey excuse for a complete moron to make, not an experienced pilot. If you're craft is that explosive, you use a different plan, a different formation, it's that simple. But for the sake of drama they chose the path completely lacking intellect.
3- So we know Rose wasn't written to be an intelligent character for many reasons. I'll mention two of the many. What person escaping with everyone looking for them leaves the manhole cover off? I realize she wasn't intended to be a complete moron, but the lack of the writer's intellect was passed on to this unfortunate character. The writer didn't go with tracking sensors in the pipes or anything...smart...instead resorting to stupidity.
4- Rose saving Finn. Nice gesture. Sentimental. Practical or intelligent? Not even slightly. First, everyone is about to be killed and the traitor stops the one person ready to save them. Second, do you save your friend by smashing your car into them at high speed? The only reason Finn is alive and Rose isn't dead already is the writer. It was dopey and insulting to the sacrifice and intellect of the audience.
5-leadership - yes, the leadership was so awful they invited mutiny. Drama, keeping secrets, especially in time of need is one thing, but at least say they suspect a traitor or something. Do something smart instead of being dumb so everyone turns on each other.
6-Yeah, that's not how explosions work. When you are in a room that blows up, you're filled with glass, metal, fire and more. You don't just blow up, wake up a few seconds later unscathed and float to safety. It was incredibly silly and deserved to be mocked for many reasons.

The plot is rubbish, acts are poor. Cheap jokes discredit supposed to be badass characters. Scenes would be low even for a parody. This movie (and the as the matter of fact The Force Awakens two) does nothing just spend all the characters that had been built for 40 years and trade them for nothing.

"It has been 2 1/2 years since the Last Jedi Ruined Star Wars. Many of the reviews claim this to be a plot whole ridden, boring, incoherent poorly written mess.
And all the blame falls on Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kenndey (The second one makes zero sense, one executive can't ruin or make all the creative stories that ruin the movie for you)
I am not here to tell you this is the best Star Wars Movie or a Masterpiece, but I think it is quite a great enjoyable movie.
I think Rian Johnson directed and wrote a movie with beautiful cinematography, great character development, a thrilling story with unexpected turns. Along with Johnson many other people brought this film to life. Anthony Daniels, Carrie Fisher, and especially Mark Hamill returned to the series and preformed just as well if not better as they did 40 years ago and Daisy Riddle, John Boyaga, Oscar Issac, and Adam Driver returned and gave Good performances (not through the roof, but not an abomination). The special effects brought it to life with superior technology to the last generation of films, but top notch for today.
******I don't expect anyone to read further than this***** (Not that I don't recommend it, but I personally don't read reviews this long, just right them)
I have know idea how long this review is and I don't want it to just be about what people complained about, but I think I need to rant about the ridiculous absurdities of many of the low nit picky complaints that people hold as legitimate complaints in their reviews of this movie. One thing that people held as truly running the movie was the uses of the force introduced as new in this movie. A common complaint is that the force is just magical and the creators of this new movie are ""just making up force powers at this point"". Some of these new powers introduced are a force connection between two people where they can transfer matter, physically touch and see each other, the ability to move your self though space, the power to survive in space, the ability of a force ghost to bring lightning from the sky, and the ability project your self across the galaxy and trick people into your appearance being real. The first problem with this is that fundamentally the force is a fictional made up element, that exists in a world that leans more towards fantasy than science fiction, therefore YES THE FORCE IS MAGICAL. Though these are problems that can be held against Star Wars as a whole. And that is fine you can not like the force. (There is sacrifice in that it is a giant plot convince that allows for things to happen that may seem like luck. But it is a sacrifice because it opened the door to a magical story that touches on basics of human ideals of what is truly good. And it has captured and continued to capture fans from around the world, and of all ages since 1977). We have no reason to think from previous that we know as an audience everything about the force, and there is no rule that you can't introduce new things, and it creates more creative freedom for the story teller to introduce previously unknown elements, and if they break previously establish rules I think that it is a worthy sacrifice for good story telling. Though the examples from earlier have some falsies they do in some case introduce some plot holes. There may be a gap between what we have seen before and what this movie displayed and there may be an unexplained reason that it was never used explore. That is the definition of a Plot Hole, it a hole that can be filled in the future. None of these break any clearly established rule made by the years and years of Star Wars media, and the creators of a high budget film should not have to hold to the most minute detail reviled by some guy in one line of a book or a comic book. (To be fair I am a big fan of material beyond the film and it does not bother me). The reason for Kylo and Rey is establish a clear reason for its origin (Snoke connected them). It is clear establishment of previous movies that the force can connect people across great distances, in this movie the degree was greater and it establishes there is a physically connection this time around. Though we have no reason to believe that this can't happen in a stronger occurrence and that this is rare occurrence that was seldom used in the past. Kylo and Rey are established as very strong and Snoke is established as even stronger. Leia is a beloved character that has clearly established that she has a strong connection to the force (she is the daughter of Darth Vader, the chosen one), and there is not reason we should not believe she pursued a stronger connection to the force over the past 30 years. As for how it is portrayed I agree it looks like superman, it clearly could have handled that better. As for the ability for her to survive in space, I don't think it has little to do with the force, it is a false assumption people have that space kills you instantly, and we have no reason to believe she was out there for that long. In the movies it is a new development that force ghost have the ability to connect with the physical world. The movie does not explain why that is or why it does not happen very often. This is a plot hole, but I think there is room for that to be filled. A force projection it what people have come to call Luke's manifestation on Crait, and it is establish to be a rare power that require a lot of concentration, and for Luke it lead to death (it took all his energy) and I don't think this was the best time for Luke's death and maybe there could have been more to tell with Luke Skywalker. Though just because this power is unestabilhed it does not make it bad, it does not mean you can't like it or think that it cheapens the story. Another plot hole that is really truly a nit pick is the bombs that blow up the dreadnought in the very first scene, they fall in space and blow up the ship. The movie offers no explanation other than that they are all stuck togther as if they are magnetic. An explenation on how these ships and bombs worked would have worked against the movie and is worse than no explanation. Poe yells ""I know everyone I am talking to knows this, but the bombs are magnetic and if I was trying to command an attack I would just say bombs."" Holdo's hyperspace ramming of the First Order capital ship is some thing we have never seen, but from the movie we don't know the difficulty of what happened and even if it made no sense what so ever she made a sacrifice which if you where paying attention you are supposed to see that see is a hero and not just a jerk. These critisims spread through the whole movie and people have dragged this mentality onto the next movie also.
I love this movie I am not going to deny that I love it. I love all the Star Wars movie. Many of the other reviews claim this to me poorly written movie with no character development. I just do not see that. I think that Rian Johnson wrote a great movie. It is complex on many levels. The most valid controversy in this movie the portrayal of Luke Skywalker. I understand that people did not like it, Mark Hamill himself wasn't crazy about it, but I like. I he is a broken hero, he has become a legend on and off the screen, this movie humanizes him. He failed and decides to run from his failure and guilt (heroes do not always have to be right). The Force Awakens established that it affected out three main heroes, Luke being the worst (He ran away to never be found). But why did he leave a map, I think it is clear his motives and ideas changed from the time he left to the time Rey found him. When he reveals the truth of the night Kylo turned he admitted his weakness, he is human and that is powerful. Though he is wrong in his willingness to help. When Yoda shows up he learns that faluire is not the point where you give up, but the point to learn the most and he uses all his strength to save the resistance.
Rey and Kylo I think are the weakest of all the arcs in this movie. Though it is not absence or all bad there is just some faults, overall I like it. I feel like the dialogue and tension is a little awkward, but for the most part I look past that. Though on re watch I don't think romantic tension is completely out of the blue, I still think it is weird. They are conflicted and on opposites sides thinking they can both get the other to join. Rey individually is lost and scared. She seeks answers and Luke fails at that, but that does not ruin her desire to do good. Though she takes a dangerous road that is unlikely to succeed straight into darkness. Kylo is conflicted and his growth in this movie is breaking free of everything and trying not to be controlled. His defiance of evil authority and opens the door to new ideas. He kills Snoke (A wonderful twist). I did not expect it.
Poe, he is very likable and we love him as a audience, and at the begin we see Holdo as a jerk, but by the end we she that it was Poe's fault he was a hotshot that did not understand his leaders and was not open listening. Holdo taught him a lesson that he learned in the end. Though we are to see that Leia sees him as a future leader with lots of potential.
Finn was running away he was scared in the beginning of the movie he held that he just wanted revenge and lived in fear. Rose changed that view in his mind that he was a hero to the resistance not just an enemy of first order. Though Roses line is cheesy ""save what you love not kill what you hate"". This is what Finn need to see and her she saved them and then he saved her. Though the kiss was thrown in almost out of nowhere. I does not work and it is weird because he does not feel the same way.
This movie is not absent of substance the plot lines, and characters draw me in, and the action and the way it looks is great. I don't think that the Kanto Byte was a weird sub plot that was a waist.

"Barring all the storyline problems established in The Force Awakens, the story for The Last Jedi was sub pare for a Star Wars movie. The plot crisis in the last Jedi was the rebel fleet running out of fuel during a high-speed chase. The entire movie outside of the Jedi Sith storyline was the characters attempting to resolve that problem. When that crisis was finally resolved near the end of the movie I was left wondering why it took Laura Dern's character so long (and so many destroyed rebel ships) to decide to crash her sip into the First Order's, when we know she was already planning to sacrifice herself. From there the movie ends the way The Empire Strikes Back begins. A battle on an ice planet, with the rebels backs against a wall. AT-AT's face off against a meager fleet of unique rebel craft's that we've never seen before nor will we ever see again. And as the imperial force takes the base the millennium falcon flees with the last of the survivors. 
Even more disappointing was the Jedi storyline. In which a disappointing rendition of an older Luke Skywalker Consistently refuses to teach Ray the force. The back story reviled to us about Luke and Kylo Ren was no more involved than what was hinted at in The Force Awakens. Although the filmography attempts to mislead the audience briefly perhaps with the vain hopes of a plot twist in mind. The growing bond between Kylo and Ray had the buddings of proper intrigue but will requires the 3rd movie in order to be fully flushed out. Then there was Ray's communion with the dark side which was very reminiscent of the cave on Dagobah. It was almost interesting, but seemed designed exclusively to do just that. Pique the interest of the viewers... And perhaps set us up for yet another plot twist in the 3rd movie? All of this is still over shadowed by the question on everybody's lips after the movie was over. ""Who is supreme leader Snoke?""

"I'm so frustrated with tros I had to write this review. I love TLJ and I know a lot of people do. But we are not the loudest voice and I don't even believe that is the majority. The majority enjoyed this movie without wanting everything old back or having our own agenda based on childhood and childish memories of how things were and should stay the same.
JJ set up Luke hiding on that island due to his failure in TFA so what was RJ suppose to do with that? Did Luke go to the island to be happy and perky and positive and continue to act like his 30 yo self? No! RJ took the premise of the previous movie and logically built on it. This is the most fleshed out version of Luke ever. People go through trauma and mid life crisises that change them. That is life. I mean look at Mark Hamill now compared to MH from the 80s. He's not the same! But at the end of the day Luke still came back and saved the day. Luke will inevitably die someday. He ain't young. Do you prefer he die of old age doing nothing? Or go out with a bang using the force? I loved his death scene. It was powerful and moving and purposeful. That complaint about his death is so childish. I mean he's done it all already let him go! It's not his turn anymore.
TLJ did nothing that a talented writer could not have taken further. (I do think JJ is talented)
For example RJ gave us such a good set up for the next movie's use of Knights of Ren. He even said he purposedly did not use them in the throne room so that they can be used later. Luke says to Rey that Ben took some of the trainees from the academy and disappeared. There were total of 12 other kids Luke trained so it makes sense the KoR are the other kids Ben fled with. So without Snoke how do you not take that opportunity to use the Knights of Ren as former Jedi trainees and build on that? Develop them and make one of them Kylo's new apprentice/ right hand man. This can be one of the things he ""finishes"" since vadar was alway apprentice to Palpatine. But instead he reverts him back to apprentice to Palpatine in 9 is so lazy. New Ren could of somehow gained Snokes darkside powers when he died making him a strong adversary to Kylo and Kylo can still be redeemed since he's still not actually the darkest bad. New Ren can find out Kylo killed snoke and have a sinister back plan to bring Palpatines spirit back and move darkside forward if you still want Palpatine in a logical way. Or anything else! I don't care just make it follow the previous movie. Just saying there were possibilities to move forward with TLJ's set up. So people who complain that TLJ put JJ in the corner have no imagination or logic.
And why reverse the message that the force is for everyone? oh no it's just for the priviledged. You gotta be born royal?",0.06597366862697054,0.4410969533611043
"Star Wars Fans Beware : If you are a fan of Star Wars lore, canon, and main characters traversing a powerful story arc, be prepared to be epically disappointed. Rebellious heroics, compelling unique battle scenes, Luke, Yoda, Chewy, R2 & C3-PO - all unneeded in this the new epoch. The basic tenants of Jedi lore: master/apprentice traditions, humility, purpose, self development - all are deemed unnecessary in this epoch where one girl possesses all of these traits while not having earned even one of them. If you have had enough of compelling real locations, riveting light saber fights, main character development, and memorable side characters, then this is your ticket - as all these are cast aside as well. Instead we have a new SW universe where a few strong women lead faceless innocents into obliteration - devoiding the audience of any care of outcome. Having established no connection to us, who really cares if they all die? Hours are then filled with reprimanding heroes, pointless coming of age crisis, irrelevant side stories and fizzling love sparks, along with a CGI fest of sleepy battles with predicable outcomes. With only 2 main characters remaining in the film, does anyone really believe some dronelike guards are going to take them out? The few intriguing characters are gone just as soon as we were drawn to them. 'Snoke', powerful Supreme leader, easily taken out by an errant saber. Benecio del 'DJ ' exhibiting Han Solo like charisma - all the better to banish him in a few quick scenes. Luke went to all the trouble of safely projecting himself holographically (note: holographs can't be killed) only to die from the labor of it. Poe, the one character exhibiting clear heroic struggle was reduced to submissiveness for all his wrong moves - which turned out to be right after all (or was it wrong?). i.e. Had he gone in with fighters (which can also carry bombs as recalled from the destruction of the Death Star) to attack the main Star Destroyer, the rebel cruiser could have escaped without being tracked through hyperspace. Instead we are dragged through the drama of large ships suddenly inching through space, the far superior enemy force unable to overtake nor flank them - for no reason given (except excruciating plot device). It was as if we were suddenly transported to the 18th century suspense of a ship of the sea taking 3 days to slowly close the gap on a slower sailboat. This epoch chase slogged over an hour of nothingness with no outcome so let's spare all the details which will be suffered by those who still choose to see this film (code: bring a pillow and eye covers). Yet we still have to get to the burning heart of the 4 questions most people have going into this film. 1. What about Luke Skywalker? 2. Who are Rey's parents? 3. Who is Snoke? 4.

"While I do agree with the other reviews in the sense that the movie is stunning, creative and beautiful, and the acting is superb, I still can't ignore the massive amount of plot-holes, we encounter during this movie...
1) Snoke, the main villain, the Supreme Leader of the First Order, and how they didn't use him, nor explain him in any way. While I am satisfied, that they didn't turn him into a replacement Palpatine, I can't help, but feel saddened by how they cut him off (literally) from the movie, without any proper introduction. We see his extreme power with the Force, and we see him as a scarred, deformed old man, with no mercy intended for anyone. Yet, even though there has been two years worth of theories and conspiracies, it isn't explained in the movie who he is, how he has gotten so powerful with the Force, nor how he was able to connect Rey to Kylo without knowing, where she was...
2) The dreadnought, the ship that could take down fleets, seen as a massive victory to the Resistance, served no other purpose than to display Poe's already proven skills as a pilot and reckless nature. His demotion had no effect on the plot, as he was still outranked by Holdo and she would still have the ability to ignore him. Furthermore, the dreadnought's ""Death Star-like"" weak point, where a single bombing run could take it out completely seemed a bit too convenient.
3) Leia's immediate mastery of the Force, saving her at the last minute, despite us never having seen anything like that from her at this point in the movie. Seemed a bit too convenient, and is not looked further into by the characters, nor is it explained at any other point. And yes, I am aware of the fact she would've inherited the same powers as Luke, but we aren't told if she even trained beforehand...
4) The codebreaker/slicer, who Finn and Rose were intended to recruit in the casino, wasn't used in any way, despite Maz (who served absolutely no purpose in the film) praising him to the skies, which lead to them conveniently meeting someone else with more or less the same skills, who'd betray them, and then run away, with no closure whatsoever on that point.

"Finally, after two long years, the third trilogy continues in ""The Last Jedi"" by Rian Johnson. From a writer/director of this calibre I could only expect the most mature Star Wars ever, and I was not disappointed on this end: in this film we finally see some doubt in the sharp distinction between good and evil, a more interesting dinamic between the baddies and the good guys. Rey doubts master Luke, Luke himself hides some shadows in his past that he would like to bury forever, Finn and the newly introduced Rose team up with a guy whose lesson is ""Good and Evil are the same: it's just business"". One could see this as a common carefree character, but in reality he channels an interesting point made throughout the film: good and evil may not be as different as they seem. Maybe. Because eventually the good guys (kind of) win, and Kylo stays true to his baddie persona, if with some very interesting twists coming along. To this regard, Rian Johnson seems to be playing with fan fictions here, proving all of them wrong even if the solution he finds is not quite as satisfying sometimes. Is it really a good idea to make Rey's parents some nobodies? What about all the threads scattered around in Episode VII that we got crazy to understand? Can it really be the best choice to let it all die this way? Sure, Kylo said that, Rey believes that, but nothing forbids for Ep. IX to change everything on this end. Luke's death is pretty good, although maybe not that necessary. Same goes for Snoke's fate: he was never anything more than a nobody himself? An all-powerful being without any connection to the past of the Sith order? Seems very cheap if you ask me.",0.19791919191919197,0.6160022446689112

Luke single handedly tookout he old emperor without turning to the dark side and was the symbol of good but now hes bad in this lame movie. Director made Fins character a cowardly wimp running quitting the resistance, Poe was turned into a treasonous idiot, and Kylo Ren a wimpy emo whiner that cant beat a girl that never trained in the force that she just picked up a light saber 3 days ago. and the Feminin heros Social Justice Warior garbage was weak and undeveloped. Everyone and anyone can have the force now in this new PC Galaxy Far Far Away, instead of working for it. The purple haired woman got everyone killed before she decided to turn he ship around and crash into the Empire Cruiser, as if it was planned all along to wait intil everyone was dead except for Leia who did a Marry Popins through space with the force.

"The movie was good, for a SW movie but is mostly bugged down by TFA and it's decision to reboot the original story so we are back to the Rebels vs Empire storyline as if what happened in the original trilogy did not count. And this movie can't do anything about it even if toward the end I hoped it would and that as Ren proposed they would forget the past and move on. Sadly they did not.
What I liked was the subversion of usual SW tropes and using them differently. I also liked that the movie said ""f... you"" to the ""mysteries"" of TFA (who are Rey's parents and who is Snoke).
And contrary to what many people say I liked the Finn/Roz storyline because it showed us that this universe is bigger than a few guys fighting each others (they are really a few in fact that does not make nay sense) and that was the only good part of the prequels. And the fact that they achieve nothing at the end is also nice. They fail. It was all in vain, but they tried.
The movies is filled with plot holes, many from the setting of the previous movie (how the vanquished Empire could come back even more powerful so quickly, how did we never heard of a Sith as powerful as Snoke in the past, and so on). But overall it is stunning, funny, entertaining and the best SW movie since ESB, with maybe Rogue One very close.",0.21836419753086417,0.5445987654320988

"I spent over two hours to see a tearful ""Twiglight"" in space. This is how a good story can be messed up. George Lucas shoud never allow others to make a movies under the ""Star Wars"" logo. Lucas work was a masterpiece in every detail. The characters, thre storyline, the locations. The two sides that compares each other perfectly - Good and Evil, Jedi's and the dark side of power, Skywalker and Vader, Leia and Luke, R2D2 and C3PO. Vader was a real dark side hero. But Kylo Ren - :D come on, don't make me lough - crying and sensitive boy from Twighlight. Even the Snoke told him that he could clean Vader's shoes. And finally the political correctness, multiculturalism and tolerance propaganda. Empire soldier, a black man and resistance fighter, an asian girl falling in love each other and almost destroy all resistance - an asian girl not allowing a black man to make a heroic action to destroy the empire canon. Star Wars saga is not about policy, multiculturalism promotion and political correctness banner. It's about good story that joins people around the world without forcing them to do this. Oh by the way. A quick tip for the producers and directors of the next ""Star Wars"" clones - Kylo Ren should cry more and he should reveal his true dark side... that he is a gay :D In Gorge Lucas original Star Wars there was a great scene when Vader said ""Luke, I'm your father"". In the new ""Star Wars"" clone there should be a new great moment - ""Kylo Ren meet Luke Skywalker and with tears in his eyes will say - Luke... I love you"" :D Oh my gosh people.

"This is the worst star wars movie that I have seen, and I am including the ewok movies on TV when I was a kid. So many other reviews already capture everything that was wrong with this film that I will spare the details. Essentially Rian Johnson (who apparently never watched or read a star wars) and Disney took a big dump on my childhood!
 They had everything they needed to make a great film and instead chose to burn the star wars franchise to the ground. The acting was fine but the plot and character development and just the lore of star wars was completely ignored. I dont see how I can EVER go to see episode 9! As far as I am concerned 7 and 8 are heresy and never to be mentioned again. I contemplate burning my copy of TFA so that I might completely forget they ever happened.
 Disney had so much material available to them that they could have made some great sequels. I refuse to EVER see another movie written or directed by Rian Johnson. Disney has ruined this franchise after being handed everything they need to make great movies from George Lucas.

"I saw this in the theatre, and was slightly disappointed. I never felt the goosebumps or magic that I normally feel watching Star Wars movies. I think I was tired or distracted or something, because watching it at home I enjoyed it much more. The effects are amazing, as is the music. The story is good with some holes, but mostly good. I didn't love everything, but there were a lot of great moments and surprises, and I did get chills the second time. I'm excited to see where the next one goes. Overall, not as good as the originals, but better than the prequels. The Force Awakens was better, but I'm ok with that-I always thought A New Hope was better than The Empire Strikes Back as well.",0.31869834710743805,0.525206611570248
"Gone are the days where one could go to the cinema to enjoy a film and be a Star Wars fan without politics. Now we have to have it shoved down our throats at every turn. Plot be dammed. On top of this they did a horrible job with Luke's character, which is now just a twisted mess completely at odds with the past. Very sad treatment for a true Star Wars fan. And the script and lore is out the window, it's just 'magical' now. The characters are just children doing childish, dumb things in a universe that feels like a big Disney theme park. Also when Yoda burns all the Jedi books and pretty much says none of it matters it's just boring books and the main character knows it all inherently anyway - wow - I cant imagine a worse message to give to today's youth than that (you're either smart or dumb, who cares about the work bit of it).

"The newest Jedi, the Last Jedi, Rey, had extraordinary powers but no Jedi training. Jedi mysticism, again the foundation of the whole series, is therefore worthless. One no longer needs to study the Force, or practice the disciplines, or grow in understanding through ascetical practice or life's hard experiences. Enlightenment and realization come cheap, and just happen, like reaching puberty. In the Last Jedi the sacred is removed from the universe. Because, we now know, it was never really there. And without that element of the sacred Star Wars no longer means anything.
 By claiming that the Jedi were responsible for the crimes of the Sith, Luke denied the metaphysical realities upon which Stars Wars was built. He was implying that without the Jedi, there would be no Sith, that these were man-made constructs. But in the original Star Wars mythology the powers manifested by each side were real. The abdication of one side in this battle would not disable the other, because each side was merely manifesting metaphysical powers that exist, and each one was motivated by moral laws that exist. If there were no Jedi, the Dark Side of the Force, through its lust and greed for power, would dominate the universe anyway unopposed. The Jedi were not responsible for the evil in the universe. However imperfectly, they were protecting the universe from it. That is why their path was so noble. When Luke disparaged the Jedi, the old Yoda would have told him, "" to assure the triumph of evil, do nothing the Jedi must.""
 And so, the Last Jedi is a post-modernist deconstruction of Star Wars. And as such it is post-modernist propaganda. Both the new Luke and the new Yoda expressed disdain for the wisdom both of them had received, practiced and taught. Remarkably their comments were very similar to those of the new Dark Lord, who said to Rey, ""the past is dead, if you must, kill it."" That is the theme of this movie, spoken by both ""sides"", but most clearly by Kilo Ren. He is the last Sith. But he killed his Master and is clearly conflicted. Rey is the last Jedi, but she was never trained and the only one left to train her just split. So really in the new Star Wars both the real Sith and the real Jedi are gone forever. The whole galaxy has lost its religion. As we must. The new generation will define new religions as they see fit. They will define their own truths from scratch as we must as well. There are no eternal verities. So instead of the vision of a moral universe based on spiritual realities assumed in the old Star Wars, the new Star Wars has replaced it with an existentialist and post-modernist one. That is, there are no fixed truths, we make our own reality, all that's real is the way I feel. Honor, goodness, nobility...illusions.
 Of course, post-modernism and existentialism are the dominant philosophical movements of our times. Thus, the great bait and switch. The popularity of Star Wars has always been because it, almost alone in popular culture, offered a very clear vision of a moral universe underpinned by spiritual reality, a philosophical retreat for the average American movie-goer. Although our popular culture and public sphere in general seldom speaks of or allows us to speak of God, we all know that that's what the ""Force"" really is. We all got hooked watching the only movies that seemed to have meaning, a grand vision, heroism, freedom fighters, right versus wrong, pure good versus despicable evil that must be vanquished, knowing that ultimately, absolute Truth was real and would triumph. This resonated so deeply in our hearts, it represented principles that so many still believe to be true but are so seldom seen or heard in popular culture. Now the Last Jedi comes along and tells its fans: ""Punked. You fools. Believing there's a God and absolute truths. Grow up."" ",0.08405074844833882,0.46569316225942703

"It is time. I never ever wrote a review before but for all you folks outside all you nerds who love the star wars franchise like me, i need to write this.
You would call me a nerd. I watched each star wars movie countless times, i read all the books, i love thrawn and luke and han and all the other characters. 
I thougt "" well the force awakens"" was ok. It felt good like coming home. And than, there was the day of the midnight preview of The Last Jedi. And believe me. During the first 15 Minutes i thought ""wow, this could be it!"" an than there were the other 2h and 15 minutes. an those felt like an accident that happend in front of you and you weren´t able to watch in an other direction. 
the whole plot and the whole storyline were absolutley redicculuous. I am one of the biggest star wars fans. Rouge one was a masterpiece for me. But what this Johnson guy and Disney did to all the fans with this movie was mayhem. 
I want to tell the whole world what Disney an the other involved people did with this movie. I want Disney to call me an say ""pleas stop telling everybody what we did, nobody watches our movies anymore!"" but i know that won´t happen. 
I cant´spoil a story, because there is none.
Dont´waste your money on this movie. Maybe watch it when ist someday runs in tv and you have to do your housework an want to listen to a movie. for now i am done with the new star wars franchise.
Today i will sit down an listen to the thrawn trilogy radiplay. The true continuation of the old star wars trilogy.

"'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' (Episode VIII) has a big challenge - live up to the original trilogy and build upon the solid foundation laid by 'The Force Awakens'. It achieves both in parts, but probably not overall. If Episode VII was reminiscent of 'A New Hope', Episode VIII doesn't really emulate 'The Empire Strikes Back' too much. It starts with a pretty good space battle between The Resistance and the First Order, with Poe Dameron (Issac) and General Hux (Gleeson) the main players. Poe's a great character, but probably needed more of him. The characters are all in different locations, so the film spends a bit of time hopping between them - Luke (Hamill) and Rey (Ridley) are on Ahch-To; Leia (Fisher) is with Poe on a ship being chased by Hux & her son, Kylo Ren (Driver); Finn (Boyega) is on a mission with Rose (Tran) at Canto Bight, a casino planet.",0.21821969696969692,0.4218939393939394

"Ignore the bad reviews from disgruntled nostalgic fans/others. I saw the 2D version last night and thought this film was both very entertaining and absorbing.

"The Last Jedi has received a lot of hate by fans and I also left the cinema angry. I myself have seen all the films once. I like the old ones, didn't like the new ones and wasn't particularly excited about Force Awakens as I felt it was more of the same.
However, it didn't make me angry as The Last Jedi did. I think my reaction and that of many fans boils down to this: They don't care about Star Wars.
The greatest hero of the old trilogy? A lonely loser on an island that has attempted to murder his own nephew. The Jedi? A bunch of useless and downright dangerous people that do more evil than good and should just die. The force? Something silly to lift rocks. 
Fittingly jokes are placed every minute or two also right in the middle of an action scene that should be suspenseful, but are not, because one character starts to ridicule the whole situation.
The problem of the movie is that it has no values. Star Wars used to be about good versus evil. Now those don't exist anymore since everything is relative. Everything is subjective. As such the movie attempts to recreate images from the previous movies and superficially it does so, but since it has no meaning, since the heroes don't defend any values, it has also no meaning for the viewer. 
When there is no good, there is no evil either.

At least The Phantom Menace had a original, coherent story and exciting new characters (Darth Maul, Darth Sidious, Qui Gon Jinn and Padme) and at least the prequels felt a part of something larger. I also had some issues with The Force Awakens, mainly the Episode 4 storyline retread and Rey's ability to the force with no training, but overall it was a decent movie.

"Why in my personal opinion, Star Wars: the Last Jedi is my favorite Star Wars movie. Just to be clear, I love Rian Johnson, and what he wanted to do was burn Star Wars to the ground. Not because he hates it, but because he loves it. He loves it so much that he wants to cleanse the garden and allow something fresh and new to grow. The Last Jedi is not concerned about what fans think. It wants to challenge you and make you question what Star Wars is and what it can be. Subverting the tropes of s very predictable franchise, and making it something that stands out, something that people talk about, is so much better than just another Death Star. TROS for me is such a bad misunderstanding of what was supposed to come. This movie laid the groundwork for something completely new, and all J.J. and Chris Terrio could think of, was to have a thousand Death Star super weapons? Really? Rain Johnson should have done Episode IX. But I digress, From its opening scenes, The Last Jedi makes it very clear where it stands - everything you thought this movie was going to be is incorrect. The symbols you hold dear, the symbols that J.J. Abrams held so dear in your stead, are being deliberately stripped of their power. If that shakes you, if that upsets you...well, that's just Rian Johnson preparing you for what's next. Abrams left him with an ellipsis, a ""to be continued"" that felt like a specific path. And Johnson takes a hard left turn into what he wants to do. It's so great, it's so refreshing after The Force Awakens played it so safe. The irony is that Rian Johnson isn't your typical Star Wars fan, he reads the extended universe material, he watches Red Letter Media, and is known for stripping away the tropes of genres and making them fresh and new.

The movie has a much more grounded tone while also giving a lot of surprises throughout. The movie functions almost like a roller coaster in the dark as every action taken in the film in jarring and often unexpected. The bold decisions by Johnson although repelling to most fans really worked for the most part (with the exception of some of the casino stuff and Rose Tico). Unfortunately, the movie was just way to sloppy to stick the complete landing. Many action sequences are a great spectacle, but Johnson did not know how to put it all together smoothly especially with a lot of small plot holes. It feels clunky at times, and many small details are just left hanging leaving the audience not fully satisfied especially when it comes to advancing the overall trilogy storyline (since it does not do that AT ALL). Ultimately, the Last Jedi is creative, exciting story-telling that looks beautiful but leaves to many loose ends to put together a masterpiece.

If the movie was to be cut to the ""relevant"" scenes it would probably be around 30min long. There was also nothing original about The Last Jedi. The picture of Frankenstein's monster comes to mind. Something that has been constructed out of parts, salvaged from things which should have stayed undisturbed and dead. For example the scene where Rey is in the boring version of the Dagobah cave, or the planet that is definitely not Hoth because it's salt (thank god that soldier told us).

"**SPOILER ALERT**
I walked into this movie with really high expectations. Perhaps too high. This film let me down on every level, and I will now attempt to explain way -- so beware of spoilers!!
The movie opens up like you'd expect, with Rey on that island with Luke Skywalker. But then, instead of provided us the long-awaited answers to the pressing questions we've been faced with since The Force Awakens, the film avoids that altogether by having Kylo Ren show up in the first five minutes and kill Luke. Yep, that's right. This movie promised to surprise you, and it sure as hell did. Anyway, then Kylo Ren takes off his mask to reveal the familiar Adam Driver face we all know, but then, there's a twist (as there is with almost everything in this movie) -- his ""human"" face is just another mask, and he removes that to reveal that he's actually Yoda! We all though that Yoda died in Return of the Jedi, but nope -- he's back. And it's not just him -- you were probably wondering how the two-foot tall Yoda fit into a six-foot tall Kylo Ren costume. It's because he standing on top of an entire family of Yoda's, all inhabiting the costume. They all disperse from the costume and explain how all the bad things ""Kylo"" has done is just a misunderstanding -- in fact, when they kill Luke, it was just an accident because they could wield the lightsaber correctly. 
After it is revealed that Mrs. Yoda has quite the attitude, she begins to insult Rey's figure, which prompts her to kick one of the baby Yoda's off a cliff, a decision she immediately regrets once Mrs. Yoda gets ahold of the lightsaber -- more on that later.
We then cut to a scene that is actually from the Force Awakens, where Han Solo is trying to make peace with Kylo Ren before he is stabbed with his lightsaber. Once he is stabbed, though, and thrown off the bridge to a seemingly endless fall, the scene is extended to reveal that ""he"" rips off his mask to reveal he is actually Princess Leia!! The couple decided to play a practical joke on Finn by having Princess Leia accompany him to Starkiller Base with a Han Solo mask, while Han Solo stayed behind with a Princess Leia mask! This was probably the one good surprise the movie had to offer, since Carrie Fisher actually died and Harrison Ford did not. It was clever the way they pulled it off too, and means, luckily, that Han Solo will be with us for the rest of the trilogy. 
From there, the movie provides some genuinely good lightsaber duels and spaceships battles that we've come to expect from the Star Wars franchise, but then comes to a screeching halt at about the ninety minute mark, when all the characters, sitting around on the Millennium Falcon, perform an extended musical number with at least four songs. I was okay for Chewbacca's solo number, who displays a surprisingly good singing ability, but once BB-8 and R2-D2 get together for the duet, the whole thing just falls apart. I recommend that anyone who needs to use to bathroom or get a popcorn refill do so after Chewbacca is done singing, because the three songs that follow are all ham-fisted and thrown together. I feel like John Williams, the composer, put all of his energy into the Wookie number, and then only had a couple of hours to compose the next three. Even the lyrics for those ones don't make sense -- I'm sure BB-8 had something really powerful to say in his song, but among all the beeps, I couldn't even tell if he was speaking English.
Anyway, the reason they're in the Millennium Falcon at all is to come to the planet where Rey is to come rescue her, but once they show up find Luke and Rey dead (Luke was by accident, but Rey had worn Mrs. Yoda's patience thin.) The family of Yoda's is there, though, so they decide to just pick them up, and then band together to destroy what is basically Death Star #4. Yep, you thought Star Wars wouldn't do it again, after A New Hope, Return of the Jedi, and The Force Awakens (and sort of the Phantom Menace and Rogue One), but they don't disappoint -- there is yet another Death Star, this time with even more power than ever before. Surprise, surprise. In a movie full of ridiculous surprises, they decided to keep this one cliche.
Of course, they destroy it, and then all get together and celebrate, only for C-3PO to propose to R2-D2 and ask for his hand and marriage, and then reveal that they are actually Luke's uncle! Princess Leia comes back from the dead as the ghost figure with Obi Wan, and Jar Jar Binks reveals that he was actually R2-D2 the entire time! Also, Finn? Lando's father. I know, I'm just as surprised as you, especially considering that they reveal that he wasn't even black at all -- he was white the whole time. Also, the Yoda family all get together to inhabit a storm trooper uniform, and then go on to kill as many of the good guys as they can with their blaster. That's where the movie ends, although there is a post-credit sequence in which the Porg, the cute and cuddly little creature from the trailers, reveals that he's actually a carnivorous monster and eats Chewbacca alive. It's played for laughs, though, so you can probably still bring the kids, although the fifteen-minute long cocaine sniffing sequence may be too much for them. 
Anyway, I've probably digressed a bit too much with this extended plot synopsis, but what I'm trying to point out is that this does not in any way feel like a Star Wars movie. I understand why this has a 56% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes -- there are just too many weird surprises that no one will expect, and between all the character deaths, the revelations that certain characters are actually completely different characters, and musical numbers, fans will most likely leave very disappointed. Critics loved it, probably because it's just so ""different"" and ""brave,"" but honestly, even if I were willing to except all the ridiculous twists in this film, I don't think it does one bit of good in terms of storytelling. The visuals are great, the special effects are top-notch, and the sound design is immaculate, but these are things we've come to expect from a Star Wars movie. In terms of characters, plot, and music, this movie took some very weird and unconventional turns that were way too strange for me and other fans of this franchise. The fact that this feels less like a Star Wars movie than the prequels is really saying something, and that isn't a good thing. I walked out surprised, confused, and ultimately disappointed, and I just hope that when J.J. Abrams takes the reins again for Episode IX, he will return to the heart of the franchise, and bring back the elements that made it so great. I loved the original Star Wars trilogy and 2015's Episode VII, I hate the prequels, but this film is by far the worst of the bunch, and I hope that Episode IX is a little more akin to the originals than to this strange departure. I can only hope, though. You could even say it's... a new hope? Sorry, I needed to end with a bit of humor, because there is none in this movie, besides Mrs. Yoda's one-liners which are surprisingly risqué, but also hilarious. 
Anyway, I will end my overly long review here. Skip this Star Wars movie and watch the originals -- and hope Episode IX returns to the glory of the originals in the same way Episode VII did. ",0.09825959075959072,0.5313152763152763

"Rey is still not a compelling character in this movie.
She is a boring character who frankly they keep trying to tempt her to the dark side when she literally has no good reason to go to the dark side. Every man she meets she looks at a father figure and I'm just like....bruh you said less than 100 words to them you got problems.
Poe actually had a good arc in this film, you don't always have to go in guns blazing sometimes there are other options. However it is very idiotic for that purple hair lady not to tell the crew the plan....so as far as I'm concerned the Poe turning on them made sense.
So tell me why Luke tries to kill his nephew because he sends a whole lot of dark in him, but won't kill his father who is a mass murderer. Is it because he sensed good in his father, but none is Kylo. Yet Rey Does Sense Good in kylo. Anyway that force connection Kylo and Rey Had was actually good addition to the story. Luke final battle with Kylo was good, but the way his character ended up very much dissatisfied me.
Kylo is a good character in my eyes. You very much see him struggling with the light side all the way until the end. A very telling scene was when he had the chance to kill Leia, with his spaceship, but chickened out. His interactions with Rey were great and anytime he is in film the movie is cool. He wants the past to die and a new world to begin.
Finn. Alright didn't like Finn all that much in the first movie, and the second movie I still don't. I don't know why he is so concerned about Rey in this movie. First thing he does when he wakes up is say ""Where's Rey"".

I was shockingly mistaken. From the beginning this movie lacked any sort of a legitimate believable plot. For what plot there is it is butchered together with many far reaching scenarios and garbage acting. Another thing that made this movie stink out loud is that lousy comedy sprinkled throughout. There was no need for the wise crack jokes in the serious moments of this film. It is sad for me to say but the Disney ""PC"" culture took over this movie. Kylo Ren was more often crying in an elevator being soft, than actually being a villain. But hey, at least we knew his feelings, right? The overall biggest disgrace in this film is the way Luke portrayed. The great hero we used to know is only replaced by some scared, grumpy old man. I cannot believe Disney could screw up one of the great characters in cinematic history but they certainly did a great job of screwing it up I must say.

The Last Jedi actually divided my friends, now I actually enjoyed this far more than Force Awakens, I thought it was more ambitious, I thought the idea of Kylo Ren representing neither the Dark Side or the Jedis was intriguing. In fact if I have a complaint is that we didn't learn more on this plot angle, cut out the nonsense in the Vegas planet and gimme that instead. That said my best friend hated it,but my wife loved it, go figure. It seems to cut this way down the middle. I do think Luke Skywalker should've been more mythic, philosophical and more Yoda and less Anakin. That said The Last Jedi's biggest strength are the scenes between Kylo Ren and Rey, I for one found these sequences to contain intrigue as you're not sure if Kylo Ren can turn Rey or if They can turn him. I also find Kylo Ren far more interesting than most of the other characters as he bares a family connection to the original characters and again I would've liked a scene with him and Leia, even in flashback. The fight in the guard room is very impressive and overall the movie's weakest element (Aside from the Vegas planet) is in fact Luke's overall bitterness subplot.

"The Last Jedi has really big shoes to fill and it tries to this as best as possible. However, the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously doesn't really help us take it seriously either. The tone of the movie is set with funny prank calls and kids dying immediately after. It wants to bring big things in the picture but it fails drastically on every account. The biggest faux-pas ofc being Luke. Seeing this approach, of a person being pushed to such acts of fear, would have been equal to Obi-wan thinking about killing Luke just for even a moment. Obviously the director had an interesting idea but did not choose the right character to try this on. Not to mention it cancels all of the growth and development that this character had up until now. The main lesson Luke is left with is that there is growth in failure, but we never see the pay off for this. The sacrifice that Holdo sacrifices herself to help the rebels escape, Luke sacrifices himself for no reason to his knowledge as they did not have an escape plan, when Fin tries to do this, Rose stops him... At this point Kylo is bashing Hux(Domhnall Gleeson) against walls in a more than comical fashion, not allowing us to fully take the moment seriously, over the top acting from Kylo- Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey (Daisy Ridley) in what is a fight that is really not bad. There is just so much more to go on how and why the elements in this movie clash in a horrific way. The movie itself is not that bad, but the potential of the story and the way they went with it is just sad and disrespectful to all the work that went into this project up to this point and all the admiration this character demanded.",0.04047619047619048,0.5051226551226551
"By this point there are many reviews about the story line of The Last Jedi so I write this review not to raise question about the plot as much to question what is the central belief in the Star Wars Universe. Throughout all the films the force serves as the center of everything. It moves in and out of everything, it is good and evil, or the light side and the dark side. The force is constantly tugging between the two so that the force will be balanced in the universe. Why then in The Last Jedi does Vice Admiral Holdo at one point as she is standing on her ship alone say ""Godspeed"" to the rest of the rebel forces as they escape? Isn't this a contradiction to her beliefs in the force? For the force and God are not the same thing. What then is the central religious or universal belief? Is it God or the force in Star Wars? For me this shows a lack of consistency in the screenwriting as the character bounces from one worldview to anther. But this is understandable as it can be easy to jump back and forth between beliefs when you have not thought through your own convictions about the world and what you truly believe. When watching The Last Jedi think through the implications of what your assumptions of the universe are, and whether you know what convictions you hold to.",0.08333333333333331,0.35482456140350876

"It became a sort of new hobby of mine. ""Reviewing this title"", this specific one, since for some reason they won't post my review. Anyway, back to it.
The 8th episode is the best of the sequel Star Wars trilogy. Unlike The Force Awakens it's not indulging ridiculous fandom by copying the original trilogy, instead The Last Jedi introduces new concepts and ideas despite of hateful fanboys who ridiculed even George Lucas' prequels which had nothing wrong with them.
And the 9th... don't get me started on the 9th. Clusterfrick (to put it mildly) is what it was since J. J. wanted to compromise and destroyed not only new good things but all the old as well turning Star Wars into cartoon basically.
Lots of viewers complained how some things Rian Johnson included were ""wrong"" and ""corrupting the lore"", but you know what? No. If you worry about the lore and integrity of the vast universe collectively created by tons of books, games and so on you should blame Disney that destroys everything it touches.
However it makes sense they ignored the majority of ""uncanonical"" stuff leaving only the 6 movies to work with. It's easier, wider audience to get to buy the tickets etc.
Here is the thing: what I personally like about the first 6 episodes the most is the personal approach. Yeah, it's epic, there is the prophecy, the chosen one..., but (even though the force is strong in Skywalker family) the characters didn't seem like omnipotent demigods/superheroes, they faced their fears and we believed them. The 8th is trying just that by making Luke broken and Rey all alone and confused. Plus, not everyone should be someone's daughter/son/grandparent, sometimes heredity is not all that important.
And it's like Luke said to Rey ""the force doesn't belong to the Jedi"", same goes for the story, this magical world Lucas created long time ago.",0.08724747474747475,0.5365656565656566

Snokes death: pros: he was never that intriguing to me anyways. His arrogance killed him much like it was the case with Palpatine. Cons: regardless of him being a stereotypical uber villain, he did seem to fill the part of main opponent, since Kylo Ren seems more like a study in angst. With Snoke, starkiller base and Snokes flag ship out of the game I have difficulty seeing the typical sense of things to take care of for our heroes in episode 9. 
Lukes death: pros: Actually liked the grumpy old man approach... cons: But spending Lukes life the way it was done seemed utter wastefull, regarding 35 years speculating what he'd be able to do as an old jedi master. It was, to me, a lack of ideas that made them spend him in an attempt to mirror Yodas serene death i RotJ. 
Hyperspace kamikaze: pros: looked cool. Cons: it changed the ""rules"" of all future space battles in Star Wars... The next time the rebel fleet is hopelessly outnumbered, hyperspace kamikaze as an option seems required. 
Reys family background: pros: Anakin came from humble beginnings also. Cons: dont serve up mysteries and then kill then so backhandedly as it was done. 
The gambling planet detour: pros: none. Cons: overall this side plot served no purpose at all other than screen time for main characters, introduction of benicios character which I didnt come to care for anyways and his final betrayel as a result was so anticlimactic. 
Captain Phasma: Again a totally wasted character... She be ""killed a third time"" in episode 9, as I cant imagine that falling into flames present her bigger difficulties escaping than being locked in a trash conpacter on an exploding superweapon.

"Just like the last film (The Force Awakens) you are either going to love it, or hate it. But I also noticed a lot of people are very much in the middle. I am one of those people. Yes there were some good elements that made me happy, but, there is a lot more issues then I realized walking out; after thinking more and more about it, the more I feel unsatisfactory. I'm not going to go into spoilers, I'm just here to tell you if it is worth the watch. Honestly, it is, but I wouldn't go rushing to the theatre to see it like with The Force Awakens. I'll start off with the positives, firstly, Mark Hamill gives the strongest performance of his career in my opinion, however some of the direction of the character was off. With that said, I felt fulfilled with how Luke was portrayed in this film. Adam Driver gives a riveting, and damaged performance as Kylo Ren, surely his character is a lot more interesting then Force Awakens. I am very curious what will happen to him next. Daisy Ridley as Rey was spot-on, so was her character in many ways. There is a little surprise in the film involving two characters which I felt satisfied with. Ok, those were the ups. As I enjoyed Luke, Ren, and Rey...thats about it for the characters. The others fell flat, Finn is remarkably pointless at this point, he has no arcs, no story, he's just there right now to give John Boyega a paycheck, good for him, but not for us. The Porgs are Fu--ing stupid in the worst way. They're just a dumb excuse to sell TOYS, but why do you NEED that for Star Wars? Doesn't Star Wars sell enough TOYS! When I saw them in the trailer I snapped, this is what Hollywood has turned to. I wouldn't mind so much if they had a purpose, other then to sell TOYS. They are not as annoyed as the Minions, but pretty close. Finn wasn't the only character who was pointless or unneeded, and some of the ways they handle the characters makes no sense, I would go into more detail, but I want you to go experience this yourself. But in my opinion, this film is worth seeing, just don't expect The Empire Strikes Back or anything. It proves that Disneyfying everything isn't always great.",0.1856269841269841,0.5307689594356261

Rey being a nobody, Good because I'm sick of this galaxy's characters somehow going back to this tiny group.
Snokes backstory, he was a boring ripoff of the emperor who I gave no craps about and it makes kylo more interesting.
Luke would not kill his nephew over his instincts. Oh like in return or the Jedi where he nearly kills his father over his instincts?
The holdo manuver, I personally just really like the moment.
Luke wouldn't abandon the force which coming off of him not doing anything in TFA is the only explanation that would make sense.

On to what I liked about the movie, Luke was the most entertaining character in the movie. His interactions with Rey were the funniest scenes in an otherwise somber movie. As a shock to no one, Luke Skywalker dies. As with Harrison Ford in Episode 7, Mark Hamill was eager to retire his character and pass the torch onto the next generation.

"This film seems to upend everything that made FORCE AWAKEN such an entertaining and promising SW sequel. Rey and Finn had terrific chemistry in FA and it seemed that this was going to be the start of another legendary SW friendship/romance. Instead in LJ they pair Finn with new character Rose and he doesn't meet up with Rey again until the very end. Rose is cute but she and Finn have ZERO chemistry. In FA, Snoke seemed poised to be an evil force like the Emperor in the original series. Instead, in this film he actually comes across more like a muppet and his demise is laughably easy. THE biggest problem I have with the film - and it's something that I also had a problem with in FA - is Kylo Ren. Most great sci-fi/fantasy epics have great villains. Kylo Ren is FAR from a great villain. He just comes across as an annoying spoiled brat. There is a moment in LJ when he pairs up with Rey and seems to be fighting on her side that I thought - ok, character has the potential to become more interesting. I thought it would be interesting if he did actually get redeemed and then had to grapple with people hating him OR I thought it would be interesting if it was all a ruse and he eventually betrayed Rey and the rebels. Instead, at the end of the fight he just goes back to being a sniveling, power-hungry brat. There is just NOTHING appealing about this villain at all. He isn't even all that good as he gets defeated time and time again. Vader was a GREAT villain in that he was a conflicted character. He started out as a regular human being who loved people deeply but he was pushed more and more toward the dark side by circumstances in his life - living in slavery, seeing his mother die, knowing that the great Jedis never did do anything about slavery, his fear over possibly losing Padme. He was also competent and powerful. He defeated Obi-Wan in the original series and nearly killed Luke in EMPIRE. All Kylo Ren seems capable of is choking his minions when they anger him. He is a caricature in what should be one of the most important roles in the story. Poor Poe just runs around in LJ looking alarmed and BB-8 who was so adorable in FA due to his interactions with Rey and Finn, here is just a mechanic. As for Luke - what can I say.

"The Force Awakens was a brilliant comeback for the successful space franchise, peaking as the third highest-grossing movie in the world, and good for Disney who paid millions to acquire it; naturally, hopes were high that the second instalment in the return series would be as good, directed by Rian Johnson (Brick, Looper, Knives Out). Basically, following the battle of Starkiller Base, General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher, in her last film) is leading the Resistance forces in evacuating their base when the First Order fleet arrives. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) goes against orders and leads a costly counterattack that destroys a First Order dreadnought. The remaining Resistance escapes into hyperspace, but the First Order uses a device to track them, and attacks again. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) cannot bring himself to fire at the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother Leia is on board, but his wingmen destroy the bridge, killing most of the Resistance's leaders. Leia is dragged into space but survives by using the Force. While Leia recovers, Vice-Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) takes over command of the Resistance. Running low on fuel, the remaining fleet is pursued by the First Order. Meanwhile, former storm trooper Finn (John Boyega) wakes up from his coma, and he asks for Rey (Daisy Ridley). Rey has just arrived on the planet Ahch-To with Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and R2-D2 (Jimmy Vee) on the Millenium Falcon to find Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Luke doesn't want to see her or know who she is and why she has sought him out. After initially saying that the Jedi should end, he hears what happened to Han Solo, and is encouraged by R2-D2. Luke has a change of heart and agrees to give Rey three lessons in the ways of the Force. Rey and Kylo begin communicating through the Force, which puzzles them both. Kylo tells Rey that Luke feared his power. Luke confesses that he thought about killing Kylo, sensing that Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) was corrupting him. This prompted Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order, and caused him to disappear and self-exile himself. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To. Luke prepares to burn the Jedi library but hesitates when the spirit of master Yoda (Frank Oz) appears. Yoda uses the Force to summon a bolt of lightning to destroy the library and encourages Luke to learn from his failure. Meanwhile, Poe entrusts Finn, mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), and BB-8 with a secret mission to disable the First Order's tracking device. Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) directs them to the casino town of Canto Bight, where they meet the hacker DJ (Benicio Del Toro). The local security pursues them, but they escape Canto Bight with the help of stable hand children and racing animals they set free. Finn, Rose, and DJ infiltrate Snoke's flagship but are captured by Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie). Kylo brings Rey to Snoke, who reveals that he connected their minds to discover Luke's whereabouts. Holdo plans to evacuate the remaining Resistance members using small transport vessels. But Poe believes her plan is cowardly and futile and leads a mutiny. Leia recovers but also wishes to proceed with the evacuation and stuns Poe with a blaster. Holdo remains aboard the ship as a decoy to mislead Snoke's fleet as the others flee to an abandoned base on Crait. DJ buys his freedom by revealing the Resistance's plan to General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), and the First Order fleet fire at the evacuation transports, with many being destroyed. Kylo is ordered to kill Rey, but instead kills Snoke and defeats his Praetorian Guard with her help. Rey hopes that Kylo has abandoned the Dark Side, but he instead asks her to rule the galaxy with him. She refuses and they battle for control of Luke's lightsabre, with the weapon being broken. Holdo sacrifices herself by slicing through Snoke's flagship at lightspeed, crippling the First Order fleet. Rey escapes the destruction while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose who fight Phasma, she is defeated and falls to her death, and the pair join the survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose attack with obsolete speeders. Rey and Chewbacca draw TIE fighters away in the Millennium Falcon, while Rose stops Finn from sacrificing himself. The First Order penetrates the Resistance fortress using a siege cannon. The Resistance and First Order are surprised when Luke suddenly appears on the battlefield, allowing the surviving Resistance to escape. Kylo orders the First Order's forces to fire on Luke, but they fail to harm him. Kylo and Luke engages in a lightsabre duel, but when he manages to strike Luke, Kylo realises that Luke is not physically present, but projecting his image through the Force. Rey helps the remaining Resistance escape on the Falcon. Luke has exhausted his power and dies peacefully on Ahch-To, becoming one with the Force. Rey and Leia sense his death, and Leia tells Rey that the Resistance can rise again. At Canto Bight, the stable hands recount the story of Luke Skywalker, and one of the children is seen moving a broom with the Force and gazing into space.

The film feels different to the rest of the Saga, largely in a good way. It does a far better job of developing the characters than The Force Awakens. There are some terrific scenes between the central characters. I will admit, however, like Ep7 the film does not do enough to develop all the characters. Phasma is again completely under-utilised, and now supposedly gone forever. Laura Dern's character also deserved more development.

"I will say one thing for this movie - it will cause conflict within you which will mimic that of a Jedi tempted by the dark side and a viewing of The Rise of Skywalker and reevaluation of The Force Awakens will only perpetuate this. I left the theater happy with TLJ but over time developed more and more issues with it and its arc with Luke. But after watching the heartless shell which was TROS and then reevaluating TFA with this considered I've finally come to think of TLJ as the only one of the new franchise which actually took any risk or spent any time on Luke. whether you're crazy about the portrayal of Luke in the first half or not this movie did spend time with him and allow him to shine bright in the end. I think as years go by this movie will gain traction and come to be appreciated more when compared to the slightly cheesy TFA and the emotionally void TROS. TFA is a fine movie but but even the scenes with the old characters feel a little forced. Love it or hate it TLJ took risks, pushed the envelope and ACTUALLY spotlighted a Skywalker rather than using his as passing fan service. That said I am no fan of Johnson and the many times his ego has shined through in interviews. You DO NOT EVER interrupt or contradict Mark Hamill - the man is the one and only Luke and no one has yet had the nerve to recast him in some one off Skywalker movie. But on that same note Johnson is the only one who let Luke shine on screen for longer than five minutes! The Mandalorian is the future of Star Wars for me but force to pick a favorite from the new trilogy I might have to stir some controversy into that pot and pick TLJ.",0.08927139037433153,0.5296791443850266

"""Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi"" is as the title already states the 8th installment for the long-running Star Wars franchise and the second of 3 films from recently. Rian Johnson took over as director and writer all on his own for this 2.5-hour film and I think he did a really good job. No surprise this won box office for 2017 movies as it was as big of a financial success as it was a success with critics and reviewers like myself, probably even more. I liked episode 7 already, but I loved episode 8 occasionally. Adding Mark Hamill to the cast does so so much for it and it's a shame he won't be back for the final chapter. But this also shows how they are not scared of killing off major characters, legendary characters even, the way they did with Han Solo in the previous. The scenes with Daisy Ridley and her male partners were the absolute highlight. First all the action on the island with Hamill and then the scenes with Adam Driver exploring the complicated relationship between their two characters. I still am not sold at all when it comes to Boyega I must say as the male lead to such a strong franchise. He was clearly overshadowed by the other guys I just mentioned. But he was also hurt by the story with the Asian girl going from zero to hero in the most unrealistic unlikely hero story I have seen in quite some time. The only purpose her character eventually has is making clear there won't be a love story between the two protagonists, just like there wasn't in the old Star Wars films, even if for completely different reasons. Several other actors reprised their roles, most of all Carrie Fisher of course and her untimely death makes some situations fairly awkward as there is a great deal of references on death surrounding her character, even if she lives eventually. As for the other actors: Isaac is a much better actor than he is allowed to show here, Serkis makes for a good bad guy once more, Nyong'o is almost non-existent, Gleeson impressed me once more. Dern and Del Toro bring characters to life that teach you that the first impression isn't always right. As for BDT, I think it was a bit strange how they can't get the real guy and just take him instead, even if he may be gifted. Next best thing huh?

But The Last Jedi takes off from that beginning at top speed and delivers an exciting ride full of twists, dangers, spy missions, humor (rather a lot of that!), possible romance, and drama. Mark Hamill is excellent as a bitter and reclusive older Luke who slowly rediscovers his hope for the future. The new characters all step up to stronger roles, with an intriguing subplot between Rey and Kylo Ren and a great turn by new arrival Rose. There are important discussions on the workings of the Force and the place of the Jedi, and an ending that seems to leave the Resistance at its lowest ebb but contains great hope from unexpected sources.

#2 Luke Skywalker would never have given up on the fight with the Rebel forces against the evil forces in the galaxy. Simply put the resolve of the Luke Skywalker at the end of Star Wars part 6 would never give up, nothing else need to be explained regarding that issue.

#4 Snoke's death scene! Snoke is supposed to be so powerful with the force but he can't tell that Kylo-Ren is using the force to turn Luke's lightsaber towards him and then kills him (Snoke) by turning the lightsaber on, really!?!?!?

"After seeing The Last Jedi for a 3rd time I believe I can finally give my honest opinion what I believe to be one of the best Star Wars movies in general and my score 8/10 is based on that. 
I am a Star Wars fan ever since I was 12 or 13 and watched the old Trilogy in the late 90's. As a kid you just can't help but falling in love with the Star Wars universe because in its core it's still a children's fairy tale. Kids just love the young prince to be (Luke), the warrior and politician princess (Leia) and naturally, the likable looks bad but is actually good thief (Han Solo) and the scary and cool Darth Vader.
Then I grew up waiting for the Prequels where Lucas actually wanted to do a real movie, where the characters went through trauma and actually looked scarred by events (unlike Leia which got her whole PLANET BLOWN UP and shrugged it off really easy, not to mention kissing her brother and stuff). There was never real character development apart from Vader/Luke and in general the characters didn't react naturally to emotions, but that was partly because THEY WERE POOR ACTORS! The only real actor out there was Sir Alec Guinness and it showed by a mile, but in all fairness, Lucas's Days of Our Lives kinda dialogue for every emotional scene which felt fake and just out of place.
So, the Prequels tried to be a much more serious movie which dwells on Politics, Espionage, Revenge and Friendship and after all these years, I still believe the Prequels to be superior to the original Trilogy which only had The Empire Strikes Back as a really outstanding feature and still perhaps the best Star Wars film to date. The only real problem with the Prequels was that Lucas never learned how to write better dialogue and we were stuck with much better actors who were fed awful and cheesy lines.
The Force Awakens had just too much to do and did it quite well as a Intro film with its major flaw being just too darn similar to A New Hope. At times even a blatant copy.
So now, Disney was faced with a choice, either to continue playing it safe with the next installment or try to take it a step further and actually focus much more on the new characters and their development instead of the ones from the Original Trilogy. For what its worth it worked great for me.
I'm not saying The Last Jedi doesn't have flaws like the too many gags, or the way Kylo turned on Luke or the almost entirely RESHOT Casino Planet part (yes, that was really not what was originally planned and you can tell).
Where it got things right is first and most of all REAL CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND REACTIONS. Luke, Leia, Rey, Poe and Kylo developed into their own characters and it felt a seamless transition. Absolutely loved and support how Luke was portrayed and his line of thought, and that scene with Yoda was a master-stroke! Kylo and Rey or Reylo as the Internet now calls it really makes sense once you think about it and whoever thinks Snoke death was poor really needs to take another look at how the Emperor died in Episode VI. Snoke's absolute faith in his abilities and that all fear him led him to become way too overconfident and Kylo got the better of him at the right moment but producing a line of thought that actually fooled his master, because he wanted to hear exactly that only he didn't know it wasn't about Rey, but HIMSELF.
Luke's logic makes sense as he is left alone and knows a Single Jedi, no matter how good he is, can't take on the ENTIRE FIRST ORDER + Snoke and Kylo, even with Rey's help. So he plunged into despair and saw the Jedi for what they really are, an interpretation of how the Force should work and a selfish one indeed. Having been betrayed by his teachings and pupils Luke lost hope as he knew there was nothing he could do. But he saw how he could still be useful and most of all inspirational! The entire First Order + Rebels SAW that Luke Skywalker couldn't be killed by Blasters, Robots, Tanks and Kyle himself, that alone was worth far more to the rebellion than him actually raising his lightsaber and charging against them. In general, if you think about it, Luke is and has always been a pacifist.
The bottom line is that, Die-Hard fans don't care about the new characters! They just want Han, Luke and Leia to ride into the sunset together with the new cast just there to play second fiddle and get passed the torch in the end, but was just too predictable, childish and not taking the franchise forward. Rian Johnson saw past that and actually did. I know you may not like it, but I do and I am also a Huge Star Wars fan, so some of us, wanted something else, and Rian did great.
I am not thrilled to see J.J. directing the last installment because this means Disney is probably playing it safe now and we are back in fairy tale land, but I am still holding on to the hope that the final installment can make Poe, Finn, Kylo and Rey as Iconic sa Luke, Leia, Han and Vader were in the OT.",0.15501810136765892,0.4900049802704671

"I went in the theater not knowing what to expect since I saw headlines in the newspapers saying that the critics loved it but not so much for the general audience.
I watched it and enjoyed it thoroughly. I thought it was essentially a return to classic Star Wars lore. In other words, it respects what I would expect from the original universe, the force and the struggle between light and dark sides.
Essentially well developed characters, great battle scenes, lots of interesting plot turns and, lots of touching moments. Acting seemed so natural that, at times, I wondered about actors being so much into their characters to achieve this level of realism. And finally, no, I am not a great Star Wars fan. I like fantastic movies in general. I am more of a fan of good movies, and I think this is a great movie.",0.2652777777777778,0.4934027777777778

"Its not that the Last Jedi is bad. Its that its soo bad...I really don't understand what move the critics were watching with this or if they are just so afraid of Disney at this point that they dare not give it a bad rating? The biggest disappointment for me on this is that after that massive success of Rogue One (I'm not talking about number of toys sold here but more to the fact that it was such a good movie) for someone not to sit back at Disney and say 'Well we've cracked it! This is the formula to make Star Wars great again.' instead they sat back and said 'Well lets not make another one of those!' There is honestly so much wrong with this film I don't know where to start. I think it may actually (whisper it) be worse than Phantom Menace. Phantom Menace had some glaring issues that if fixed would have made for a decent film. There is nothing that would redeem this. Luke hams it up, Leia (bless her) dials it in and Chewie is on steroids. I'll not bore you all with the problems with the film but simply choose one of my personal worst moments. The scenes with Snoke in are probably the worst CGI I have seen in any star wars movie. His throne room looks like something out of an original series star trek set design and the cgi for snoke himself is just awful and thats before I even start on the characters role in the movie. So disappointed and the only light at the end of the tunnel is a JJ (I'll do whatever Disney tell me to) Abrahams shaped train heading the way of the Star Wars franchise.

I'm not one of those die hard Star Wars fanatics that wait in long lines desperate to see a new Star Wars film. I am not sure why some of you are complaining a movie's direction when there were so many likable, interesting characters, I get it, it has a darker theme compared to Force Awakens. What I like about Rian Johnson's direction of Star Wars was that it was not meant to be produced in a way to make star war fans angry (I actually felt Luca's prequels were far worse). There were many similarities with past Star Wars movies with this one. Many of the characters in this movie were so ordinary and end up as unlikely heroes and you really feel for the characters.

"Being the 9th in the saga, and set in Space, this could easily have been titled Plan 9 From Outer Space, but this title had already been taken.
That said, it closely followed the formula of that film... Confused story line, wooden acting, ludicrous plot. All it needed was the appearance of Bela Lugosi's chiropractor to have made it perfect.
This may well go down as the worst film of all time, knocking Plan 9 from the top spot.
Indeed they might even get Ed Wood to direct the next film. He might have died decades ago, but in this new Star Wars film anything seems possible.
Since when were Mary Poppins, and Oliver Twist in Star Wars? Did I see Dumbo in one scene? Gravity in space for Bombers??
And when is an alliance not just a small group of mates? Can they field enough players to make up a football team?
It would be hilarious if it wasn't such an offence to Star Wars fans.
If, like most fans, you've avoided any information until you've seen the film, then you won't be reading the reviews until it was too late.

Hell, the rebels can just wait the New Order out and they will die out based on shear stupidity. They can't even take out one ship, are you kidding? Who wrote this? Instead they just sit and wait and give the rebels plenty of time to come up with a plan and send folks out on a freakin' mission. What is the excuse? The rebels are out of the range of the big guns.

It is an action packed film in which you don't know how it's going to finish till the last minute.
The usual Star Wars films are about the battles between the dark and the bright side of the power, and of course this isn't missing in this part either. The story is dramatic, sometimes humorous and romantic. The characters act as positive or negative heroes but you also find the characters that betray their own people.
The effects are great according to me, especially in the war scenes. The best effect, however, is a light sword that appears very often in Star wars.

They show how easily heroes fall. They make the audience believe that none of it matters. Everything has to collapse at one point. TFA set up as many cliffhangers as TLJ took down characters. The last two years were spent, wondering who Rey and Snoke really were. But TLJ showed me that they didn't matter. Snoke was just another wannabe Sidious. Snoke was blinded by his own power and confidence and it resulted in him predicting his own death. It's about time Star Wars got off of sucking the ""Evil Dude rules and Jedi will take him down"" d***. This is something different. Both Ren and Rey are two opposite sides of the same game, of trying to create a better order in the galaxy in their own twisted ways. Rey was a nobody, who came from nothing, and she knew it all along. She just kept it buried, deep down. Ren has powerful Skywalker potential in him, and all he's trying to do is restore order to the Galaxy, even if it means killing his own father to submit to the Dark Side to do it. And the mind talking sequences are beautiful. When their minds bridged, their opinions were challenging each other, about what the situation really is. Okay too much philosophy. Back to square one. Star Wars The Last Jedi is an amazing movie with visual effects stunning as ever. The twists in the story are heartbreaking and unexpected. The story is flawless, and extremely awesome. I feel that Star Wars fans need to lower expectations and stop following the Hate Bandwagon. Nothing will ever be as great as the Original Trilogy.

First of all, I think this is THE MOVIE of the YEAR - amazing scenes, interesting plot and well-developed main characters.

I love Darth Vader, but I think Kylo can be even better than him in the next movie. The relationship between Kylo and Rey is also well-developed and their connection is something new in the whole Star Wars saga. 10/10 for Ben Solo and Rey from me!
Although there were some ridiculous scenes and characters (General Hux), I think you must watch this movie! I know that most of the fans expected more from Luke and Snoke, but their role in the movie was quite good. The soundtrack is once again out of this world!

"Rey (Daisy Ridley) has found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a faraway island planet and she asks for his help. As most viewers know, the universe is in jeopardy again, for after the Rebels got rid of the Empire, the new First Order arose thirty years later. As the supposed ""Last Jedi"", Luke is needed to fight Supreme Ruler Snoke (Andy Serkis) and his nefarious sidekick, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). But, alas, Luke has not been in hiding for no reason. He blames himself for Kylo Ren's transformation from his nephew, Ben Solo, into the evil henchman. Nothing doing he tells Rey. Meanwhile, the remaining Rebels, commanded by Princess-General Leia (Carrie Fisher) are being pursued again by Snoke and have very few options. There remains a main ship of ""good guys and gals"" with some lesser transports and Tie-fighters. Very brave, they leap into lightspeed, only to find the First Order has somehow tracked them. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and new gal Rose seek out Maz (Lupita N'Gongo) for a code breaker to help them find the Order's weaknesses. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren and Rey have disturbing long-distance talks, for they alone can see each other through time and space. Naturally, KR wants Rey to turn to his dark side and she wants the opposite. Snoke, meanwhile, is unhappy, at times, when Kylo Ren and General Hux (Domnhall Gleason) fail in their quest to wipe out the Rebellion. Can Rey and her companion Chewie persuade Luke to help them with his powers? Can Kylo Ren be turned back to the ""light"" or does he have other tricks up his sleeve? This amazing film is beautiful, exciting and full of fine performances, including Fisher's last. The script and direction are top flight, although a sharper edit would have prevented some slower spots. Nevertheless, to miss this masterfully made movie would be a crime of the first order.",0.1404340704340704,0.5096150696150696
"My husband and I saw this movie just a couple of days ago. Let's face it, the franchise is dead. They need to leave this old tired corpse buried. There hasn't been a good Star Wars since the first two original movies were made. Perhaps if Lucas would have continued right away and kept it fresh, it might have worked. But reviving it over and over again without anything really to say, and I mean NOTHING; makes no sense. There is literally no story here. I can sum it up this way for you: BOOM BOOM BOOM, POW POW POW, VERY LOUD MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS, muffled voices, BOOM BOOM BOOM, POW POW POW, VERY LOUD MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS, muffled voices, and so on. I was so bored I fell asleep during some parts in spite of the loudness to most of the movie. The problem is that at the end, they eluded to yet another movie coming...oy vey, they need to let this die! Unfortunately, with this repeated series of horrible movies, the original great first two movies are getting forgotten in this hot mess. Sometimes, you simply need to let the good movies live on as classics and stop ruining them with really bad ideas.

"The reason for my title is this. I saw the film with my Dad on Friday and I have to admit I liked it. I thought it was an okay film for what it was. The reason I said this is because I liked the Force Awakens a lot better than Jedi because at least their was a story there. The Last Jedi was basically the same rehashing of the same Star Wars plot the Empire is trying to take over and the Resistance is trying to stop them. That's it. That's basically the film. And no that's not a spoiler because I don't do spoilers.
 What I liked about The Last Jedi I loved Rey and her journey to find Luke and trying to find out who she is and learning the Jedi arts. I loved BB8 he was basically doing everything in this film from piloting the airplane, helping take down some guards or helping out anyway that he can for the Resistance against the Empire. I did enjoy seeing Luke even though he was asking like he was an manic depressive disorders douche to Rey but that sort of reminded me of when Yoda treated Luke that way in Empire Strikes Back which was cool but sort of mean to be honest. I did enjoy seeing Carrie Fisher in her last role as Princess excuse me General Leia BUT to be honest she didn't really do much in the film but whatever at least they didn't cut her out because she passed on but I do have an issue that I'll get into in my dislike part of the review. 
 What I disliked about the film which isn't much BUT the major thing I'm disappointed with and it's really not a spoiler BUT the way they honored Carrie Fisher's memory at the end of the film. They didn't do anything! They just said in loving memory of our princess....that's it. Of course her role in the film was a bit weird as well which I can't say because I don't want to give away anything but I found it weird the way they kept her in the film. 
Other dislikes where maybe the so called training of Rey which didn't live up to the hype and that's all I'll say. Kylo Ren was a bit lame in this film at least in Force he was interesting in Jedi he was just an emo kid on a bad acid trip but I did like the lightsabor battle with Rey that was pretty cool so I guess that would go in my like part of this review. I did not care for that Asian chick Rose she was a bit annoying with Finn. One more she hates him and then she somehow loves him it's like pick an emotion girl. 
 Should you see this film? Well I mean if you're a Star Wars fan you're going to see this film and possibly love or hate it.

"I don't know where to begin, but I'll sum up the problems with this observation: it's apparent that priority 1 was to ALWAYS surprise the audience by doing the least expected, and priority 2 was to add lots of laughs. These overshadowed the film so much that character consistency and continuity with things like what can be done with the Force and how technologies like hyperspace work were compromised. So were all the story threads set up by TFA. All other saga films are in the genre of ""space opera"" hearkening back to the old 30's serials. This move was an action comedy like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". Switching style and basically rebooting the film in the second trilogy are bad enough, but the utter disrespect for the established characters is too much. The worst part is that casual fans and critics are giving it high marks, because if you know nothing about Star Wars lore, symbolism, ties to Eastern philosophies, and general cinematic style than it seems entertaining.

"I rated ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)"" a 7 and in that review I explained why I gave it that rating and that I expected the sequel to be rated higher. In short, I gave The Last Jedi's predecessor a 7 because Luke Skywalker was not in it until the final minute or so of the movie. That led me to believe that they'd bring the Jedi master back in the Last Jedi in a very powerful role. I couldn't have been more wrong. I went to see this movie because I expected Luke to be reengaged in the battle. Well, they engaged him, but not in any meaningful way from a warrior's perspective. After his big moment, he was apparently so overexerted that he died and faded away. Just sad, I mean really sad that this was the manner in which Star Wars' greatest hero dies.

Of course, Nolan's masterpiece is better, but both are still good movies so it's a fair comparison.

This movie tackled the hypocrisy of the Jedi better than any other piece of star wars content allowing for a much smarter feeling movie. Not to mention the final hour of this movie was incredibly entertaining and action packed. The scene where Luke projected his body with the force on Krayt is probably the best put together scene in all 11 movies (as of June 2021).

Despite going back to practical effects in the last movie, this one goes back to over reliance on CGI despite the prequels being criticised for this reason - hypocrites much? Cringe slow mo scene at the end - again, not something you would see in a SW movie. Rian Johnson has taken no risks, there are no twists as you might expect from the marketing and any Snoke or Rey's parentage theorists will be bitterly disappointed. This film is full of cringe worthy sexual innuendos, Finn calls a character a 'bastard' in one scene (really, was this necessary) and with the new pointless character Rose, this movie is nothing more than a desperate politically correct cash grab by Disney in an attempt to appeal to the masses with lead characters from different ethnicities and backgrounds.

"The newest installment in the Star Wars series has critics and a portion of the fans divided. While, I can't say The Last Jedi is without its problems, overall I did enjoy it and consider it to be an improvement over The Force Awakens. In some ways The Last Jedi is predictable and rips off The Empire Strikes back, but director/writer Rian Johnson took some left turns and added some plot twists that made it interesting. I thought Mark Hammill gave a excellent performance as Luke with this new take on the character. The film looks great and is fairly on point with action and special f/x. The characters are beefed up are and there are more layers to them and the cast did a fairly good job. The creature/critters are there for little kids that like that crap, but are mostly in the background and did'nt bother me too much. On the downside, the story could use some tightening up. The film also is too long and could have edited some of this stuff out to make it flow better as a whole. Some scenes and humor go way past ridiculous as well. The Last Jedi is a kind of mix of highbrow and lowbrow elements that does not always work and won't please everyone, but it is far from being a bad film and at the very least entertaining and not completely predictable. It also must be noted that movie productions with gigantic budgets have a lot of people's hands in the creative side of this, with studio executives, producers,etc that go out of their way to try to make this appeal to as much of a wide audience as possible, so some of those problems are probably a product of that of what elements to throw in/take out. It is doubtful that on a big studio production like this how much creative control Rian Johnson really had or how much material made its way in to generate money and appeal to the lowest common denomenator. As of this moment, I found this to be interesting and enjoyable, how well this holds up, time will tell in the years to come.",0.14378309674821307,0.5072707137823416
"*****Contains spoilers about plot twists and stuff so go away*****
This review is mostly about the stupid fans that go on about how bad this movie is and are really bad at criticizing the movie
This movie currently has a %53 on Rotten Tomatoes...
The My Little Pony Movie has a %80 and this just isn't acceptable...
Can people get their heads out of their heads and be reasonable for a second. This movie is currently being criticized for doing stuff different and ""destroying Star Wars"". God forbid the movie had creative minds behind it and was written excellently (at least for a blockbuster I wasn't asking for The Godfather and I didn't get it but the script is amazingly good still) 
These are probably the same people that criticized Force Awakens and Rogue One for being really predictable.Are you kidding people? Are you really butthurt over really good plot twists and change in Star Wars dynamics ? Do you need to know everything about a movie before it comes out ? Is this where the movie industry has come to. I'm seriously baffled because of these mindless reviewers and I'm siding with the critics for once. I'm more baffled at the people that give this movie 1 star. 1 star? are you joking. Even if you didn't like the plot or the changes, you gotta admit the acting is the best in the series, the visual effects are stunning, the movie has great direction (thank you Rian Johnson you beautiful beast), the soundtrack is also awesome, the action is probably the best in the series. 
So I'll like to go against some stuff that people got annoyed with
Leia using the Force? - Even tho we haven't seen Leia use the Force for lifting stuff but she was clearly Force sensitive because she is the daughter of Anakin and does have the Force to help her out.
Luke's character ark. -People are talking about this while Yoda literally did the same thing after ep III where he went to hiding in Degobah
Snoke wasn't explored well. -As much as I kind of agree with this but Snoke's character was already weak and as mysterious as he was he was pretty much a placeholder for Kylo to get in power and It gave us one of the most intense scenes in the series
Porgs? -I don't think much people are talking about them but they are awesome and adorable need one immediately

"Growing up with star wars as my favourite franchise and universe to explore as a child, I've been heavily invested in the new star wars sequels, yet it seems the last jedi follows the force awakens down a path of disappointment and destruction of the starwars universe i had come to love. the movie on its own was good, but as a star wars film i hated it.

OK, I get it, let's show some positive figures for minority children, and I think thats great, there should be more positive minority figures in the movies, but this was so blanket, that it was obvious to everyone, and the bad guys were so cartoonishly bad that it got you nowhere.

"Let start that this movie is the end of a new beginning and many people that are star wars fan will be disappointed but for those that know that is the end of the line for the Skywalker family. This is the end and is the perfect beginning for a new trilogy. Director and Writer Rian Johnson did an amazing work together with the Disney story writer team. 
I went to the movie not expecting what I saw, specially Luke story Arc that was enough for me to prove that the movie had a point to teach us about Failure. Yes we don't have the heroes that we grow up seeing is true I wont take that away, but heroes to can fail and be weak and that is the greats teach in this movie. To accept our failure and take on responsibly of our mistake, Luke run away to hide from the mistake that he make with Ben Solo( Kylo ren) creating the monster that he so much fear.
Another point that I want to add is that many people are disappointed with who Rey real parents are and I even wonder did you really watch the FA because it was state very clear that her parents were No body. This also teach us that you don't need to come from a very special blood line to have that type of raw power, untamed power.
And that in mind is the main reason they gave the next trilogy to work on to Rian Johnson. He will bring a new generation of force user stronger than before in the force, he will bring the balance to this new uncharted territory of the universe of star wars.
I will have to say that performer wise Luke , Rey and Kylo were amazing and beyond my expectation the throne scene what a scene it was amazing and the slow motion that make my poor lungs to stop breathing for a second or how good and stratify was to see that scene breath taking. Humor level was good I enjoy Poe much more this time than in the FA. Finn and Rose story arc it was good and safe play, that what I felt the majority of the time that I was watching it, I even though for a second that I step in back in Hunger Games but let no go there.

"I think the Star Wars franchise moves closer to the edge of irrelevance with each entry, starting with (in the order actually made) Attack of the Clones and proceeding onward. The first portion of this movie mildly engaged me, the much too long middle portion with Luke and the girl was Star Wars at its meandering, grade school arbitrary philosophical worse, then the action kicked back in and saved my 12 year old from leaving the theater (by a hair). Ridley is attractive and effective, Driver presents fine as the young evil force, but the explanation (if there is one) as to why he went bad is even less convincing than for Anakin Skywalker, and for this to actually work that has to be done better. Star Wars was always light on believable plots or characters, more in the mode of this person is this way and that person is that way, this happens and don't ask anymore questions.

The main characters are acted by Daisy Raidley(as Rey in the Star wars), Adam Driver( Kylo Ren), John Boyega( Finn), Mark Hamill( Luke Skywalker) and Carrie Fisher ( Leia Skywalker).
It is an action packed film in which you don't know how it's going to finish till the last minute.
The usual Star Wars films are about the battles between the dark and the bright side of the power, and of course this isn't missing in this part either. The story is dramatic, sometimes humorous and romantic.
The characters act as positive or negative heroes but you also find the characters that betray their own people.
The effects are great according to me, especially in the war scenes. The best effect, however, is a light sword that appears very often in Star wars.
The main heroes are representatives of the dark and the bright side of power.

"First of all, the amount of hate that this film has received is unnecessary. People who claim to be Star Wars fans say that this ruins the universe that was previously established. Those self-proclaimed ""Star Wars fans"" mistake the skillful expansion of the Star Wars universe and its possibilities with bad writing and an incoherent story. I have seen this multiple times in theaters and feel confident in saying that this is the most stunning action film to see in theaters, followed closely by Thor: Ragnarok. The cinematography and action scenes are some of the best in the franchise. They all serve the plot and are also wildly entertaining.
While The Force Awakens was happy, fan-pleasing adventure, The Last Jedi has its sights focused on advancing the characters, story, and universe to a place that no Star Wars film has ever been to before. The Force Awakens took pleasure in the old cast members and did their legacies justice. While that was what worked perfectly for that film, The Last Jedi is not as concerned with honoring the original trilogy's characters. The Last Jedi is entirely focused on the new Star Wars and what it holds ahead of it, if that wasn't clear by the fabulous last shot that inspires not only hope, but excitement for what is next to come in the Star Wars franchise. 
Rian Johnson brought new life and energy to the Star Wars franchise at just the right time. The plot is the most original one since A New Hope, or The Empire Strikes Back. 
At first, my main gripe with this film was that some characters' final moments or last scenes feel dissatisfying. Upon rewatch, I realized that their final moments worked perfectly well in the context of this film and this film only, not the rest of the Star Wars franchise. Rian Johnson is merely concerned with making this Star Wars film for what he thinks a Star Wars film should be, not what everyone else wanted or expected this to be. Not every Star Wars film can be a fun, simple adventure with a death Star storyline. Rian Johnson knows that more than everyone else.

"Star Wars - the Last Jedi is one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. It is terrible. The acting, the directing, and of course the insipid screenplay, all sink to rock bottom, even for a bloated Hollywood blockbuster. As a published film critic with many years experience, I have seldom been more angry at a Hollywood studio for producing such a tiresome, confusing and indeed boring mess. 
Let's be straightforward: I squirmed through the entire two and a half hours of anyone's waste of time and money, from the grammatically-challenged opening crawl to the ridiculous (and mindlessly telegraphed) anti-climax. Watching this movie was worse than having teeth pulled, it was the long, gut-wrenching and bloody agony of recovery afterwards. 
Above all, this Disney-produced mess was a cinematic embarrassment. At least with the absurd Marvel movies we have costumed heroes to root for, and our own world to fret about. Who could care less about the anonymous locations and bland characters of this latest assembly-line installment of the redoubtable Lucasfilm franchise? George Lucas once stated the Star Wars movies were made for kids. Watching The Last Jedi as an adult is a stupefying experience, leaving one wondering if any adult had anything to do with its writing or direction. Indeed, the movie feels as if a sugar-hyped horde of grade schoolers mismanaged the entire enterprise. 
A film criticism usually begins with generalities of story and character and then moves on to critique specific aspects of the production, picking out special moments and positive components while throwing in a few negative zingers to entertain the reader. The Last Jedi is so completely bad I cannot comment on a single good scene. I cannot think of one. Not one. What else can I say? I suppose the visual effects were effectively ""awesome,"" but in a cinematic universe filled with black holes of plot, character and storytelling there can be no purchase. I was adrift watching this disaster - as any mature adult should be - so perhaps the only compliment I can pay to the production is ""better luck next time."" The problem with that is Jedi follows on the heels of the clichéd A New Hope remake The Force Awakens, which at least introduced new characters and planetscapes. The Last Jedi is so bereft of original thought and design, it makes The Force Awakens look like a brilliant new concept by comparison.

"That's quite an achievement. The prequels were so bad it's hard to rank them. The Force Awakens was a derivative retread of the first film that pillaged the characters and fairytale of Star Wars, writing the central characters out (or plain killing them off) in favour of emo Darth Vader, a load of other dull cardboard cut-outs and way too much CGI. There's nothing good about The Last Jedi. The script is truly awful, what passes for characterisation is so contrived that it's insulting, there isn't even a single exciting action sequence or fight. As a Star Wars film, perhaps script and characterisation aren't that necessary but when they're this bad the film is unwatchable. Crucially, there's no coherent plot, just a whole load of stuff that happens. So many tiresome grand gestures, sickening amounts of CGI, the odd pointless grandiose speech. Perhaps up to this point The Phantom Menace had been the worst film in the series. Its tale of some trade federation blockading a CGI planet is more gripping than the goings-on of The Last Jedi.

"A movie full of fan service, incredible scenes, great art direction and technically above the level, but it's also a movie that has its problems, often appearing as a movie of scenes that work well in isolation, ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi ""It delights the most loyal fans of the franchise for its"" Ahhhh, that's what I wanted to see ""moments, but in a cooler view, we have script, rhythm and development issues. The script makes the first two acts of the film look like great fillers, because it does not walk, the intention was to develop the character of Rey, which does not happen, we see only 2 acts of discussion, thoughts and training, everything half played and superficial, in the lack of depth of the legendary Luke Skywallker, or in the character of Finn who is wonderful in the first film, with dramas and dualities and here he is played on a cliché secondary mission, with a romantic cliche, following the traditional journey of the hero that adds little in the movie, the only character you notice some development is Kylo Ren, even so, he ends the film still in a certain conflict, we do not feel confident in it. ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" is a legitimate half-story film, a movie that will serve as ground for Star Wars episode IX. The highest point of the film is his art direction, which explores a new fauna, and features gorgeous costumes, extra costumes and absurd attention to detail, as well as the classic Star Wars soundtrack, the soundtrack is great and not for a second, dictating for many times the pace of the scene, without fear of open plans or zoom in's, the camera behaves very well, always trying to bring the maximum of wealth to that world that really gives an impression of being alive and the rhythm of the film's assembly of the one compensated in the pessimo rhythm of the script. The performances, which in episode VII are one of the great highlights, here are obsolete and cloying, but stands out for Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver and Carrie Fischer, in addition to the great screen presence of Mark Hamill. Finally, it's a movie that cardboard fans will love, like me, and the movie has very good things outside the direction of art, such as the exploitation of force and all the symbology that is exposed around it, or the bridge of communication that unites the Jedi, or even the clean of the past seeking a renewal for Star Wars, that renewal, which is happening even though it is difficult to detach from the characters of the past, and this movie was where it had to happen part ""boring"", to serve as the basis for what will come.

Not only does The Last Jedi give us a collection of annoying and unnecessary characters, but it also manages to effectively ruin characters from the original trilogy we already know and love. Perhaps the most frustrating part of all is the movie's inability to have even a moment of seriousness without being broken up by a ""witty"" one-liner that ruins the entire scene. This might as well have been an avengers movie. From start to finish, this movie is overly ambitious, nonsensical, and irritating.

Apparently Rian Johnson had seen a great evil in Star Wars and in Luke Skywalker in particular that needed to be righted. It is the only way I can explain Johnson taking a big crap on the character. I don't know his motive but Johnson's message seems to be if you thought Luke Skywalker was the great savior of the resistance he's not. He's a piece of crap. If you thought Luke Skywalker was special he's not. Rey doesn't come from his privileged family and yet she's more powerful in the force than he is. If you thought Luke Skywalker was the most powerful Skywalker he's not. His sister could have been more powerful than him if she wanted to. And if you thought Luke Skywalker would be redeemed in the end he wont. The best he'll do is use all his might to pull off a David Copperfield magic trick and then fade away. Good riddance.

"Extremely disappointing. This may beat Attack of the Clones as my least favorite Star Wars film. First, the dialogue and the story are both incredibly flat and boring. The film tried to be funny much too often, which often came across awkward. And after sitting through what felt like an eternity, nothing really seemed to be said. Like a dream where you run and run only to exhaustedly turn and find you've only traveled a few feet. Sure, things happened, but nothing was interesting or compelling. Everything was just flat. It is hard to go into the many, many flaws of the movie without spoilers, but this movie was a complete disaster. While each scene viewed in isolation may seem like a genuine part of an epic Star Wars film, when splattered together across a two and a half hour nightmare the film sputters and dies, never really grabbing its audience. I felt nothing for the characters. I had no interest in the story. The only upside to the film is that the actors did an amazing job with what was written for them.

"The Star Wars films are a unique and unusual anomaly in an otherwise saturated lineup of blockbusters in its entire long running history. Other than the fact that it is a huge global phenomenon and the sci-fi classic that most filmmakers wouldn't have possibly conceptualized, it also has a drawbacks because of this status. It's almost as if each movie now have to live to the lightning that the original trilogy caught in a bottle. That there would be certain rules, expectations and certain events that must take place in order for it to be accepted. However, here comes Episode VIII, a film that unequivocally subverts and challenges the very foundations of an already 40 year old saga.

You wanted Luke to train Rey like Yoda taught him? Well, too bad. Take your impotent butthurt somewhere else. This film had its issues, such as the humor being a bit too silly and broad (more Farce than Force, as it were), even for a historically silly fantasy franchise, but it was enjoyable and visually stunning. I particularly like how several characters took advantage of what they knew of the temperaments of those around them to further their various goals. Kylo fools Snoke, Luke fools Kylo. I also like how Finn and Poe basically fail at almost everything they try, and it is the women around them (Leia, Rey, Rose, and especially Holdo) that get stuff done.

"I've been a fan of the series since the original opening in 1977, and while the prequels had some issues, they were OK. TFA was a nice throwback and set up some interesting new story arcs for what was supposed to be this. However, the direction this abomination took damn near killed this 40 year franchise. Between Leia flying through space to Rey moving giant piles of rocks ( neither of whom had a Yoda or Obi-Wan to train them), it just dumped on the whole history of the story. What they did to Luke was abysmal. They would have been better off having him offed by an Ewok. They killed the villain set up in TFA with no explanation who he was or why he mattered, killed Phasma like she was a run of the mill trooper, and had a way too long casino/horse creature arc. This movie did nothing to advance the franchise and here's hoping JJ Abrams has enough talent to resurrect the franchise from the raging dumpster fire this pathetic garbage left behind. This makes Phantom Menace w/ JarJar look like Macbeth.

From the opening battle and escape. To the epic fight in Snokes throne room. The wise words of an old friend. Each characters journey, facing fear, anger and conflict takes you on an emotional rollercoaster.
Canto Bight aside, which isn't awful, it serves a wider purpose of showing more than just Rebels and First Order. The Vegas of Star Wars. Says it all...
Force fight, Finn/Phasma fight and a Light Speed collision idea finally come to light in spectacular fashion.
Final battles are equally spectacular, again playing on the ""fear leads to anger"" trope, the heart of every Star Wars movie.
And a twist of self sacrifice (nod to Obi wan)... The swell of JW score, the beautiful visuals of the western stand off and that reveal... Wow! It still resonates on the 2nd, 3rd and 8th viewing as it did when the cheer went up on opening day.

"After the success of Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015), director Rian Johnson had to strike a fine balance in the following sequel, Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017). Since The Force Awakens was essentially a flashy, rehash of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), The Last Jedi needed to separate itself from the predictable path already laid out in Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Unfortunately, the formula employed in Empire Strikes Back has become so integral to sequels that deviating from it could prove to be disastrous. While I'm curious where Episode IX will go from here, I hope it builds upon what Johnson has done here. The tensions of war helped drive the characters into interesting moments of growth, defiance, and desperation, but much of the story was well wrapped up by the time the credits rolled.",-0.031060606060606063,0.3554924242424242
'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is written and directed by Rian Johnson and stars most of the same cast from the previous installment with one new addition of Kelly Marie Tran who plays a character named Rose. This is the first Star Wars film written and directed by one person since the prequels with George Lucas- An important point to make since one can definitely sense that there is a singular vision at play here. The visual style is unlike anything we've seen before in this franchise and that is most likely down to Johnson's sensibilities. There is breathtaking moment at a certain point in the movie where all sound is cut out and you're just left with the images of an epic moment and it is really something to behold. ,0.20939090149616468,0.4450805042910305

Well, back in 2017, I remembered that people already started to look at the film negatively because of the ""Jedi must end"" line that appears on the early trailer of the movie. Before its release, the film was getting positive reviews. The critics liked the movie, so nothing to worry about. The buzz started when the leaks, with all spoilers, popped up in reddit. 'Everyone' was mad about the portrait of Luke in this film. Why he would even think in kill his nephew? And the idea of Luke dying received a surprising amount of hate.

"Not the movie you're looking for. Probably most disappointing Star Wars I've seen in the current state of the series. The phantom menace was hyped so much but I personally have never felt as hype for a Star Wars as much as this one with reintroducing Luke and all. It has it's good moments but this was supposed to be a serious and important plot driven Star Wars. It felt so much more with the title just being in red. It's way too funny and completely kills almost all the drama and emotion to every scene into look we're meta and it's Star Wars, something movies tend to do a bit too much, as yes it does have a real cheesy script. Especially with the force lines. This movie is also not very predictable, in a bad way since it fails to make sense many times. There are all many plot holes ranging from the best ship in the entire First Order Fleet having No shields to the force being messed with. The force in this film is turned into something Indescribable without spoiling plot, but it does not follow the ways of the prequels or originals. Kylo Ren works the best but the majority are the extremely disappointing and do absolutely nothing important. Characters that were supposed to be important are the ones that just nothing. They killed off these characters that meant something and could've been something. Snoke is the worst villain of all time, how is Phasma here, etc. Luke's character has become the opposite of what he was before and that annoys many though it wasn't that major problem. Mark disagreed with how Rian wrote in his character and I do as well but its not insanely unrealistic result. The meanings tied with the story are also awkward and inconsistent with animal cruelty, poverty, and rich people that made money off war, the balance of the force, this, that, and just again a mess. All the fan theories in this current state are completely wrong on multiple questions. It's an extremely messy Star Wars film with the pacing being action for 20 mins and then story for a whole hour and a half but it felt longer and maybe I say it is longer. One scene in this movie, the Casino one, apart of the story/plot focused chunk is not really needed and ruins the movie a lot. The focus again feels out of place and the character Rose, makes it feel two people in a Star Wars set screwing around. Two scenes were ruined, one by Rose and the other by the force. There is a lot of accepting to this film's new take on the force and its powers, along with the Jedi order. It does have its good parts with the action and some otand by no means is it a bad movie but it is not a good Star Wars. It's a 6/10 mixed with it being a Star Wars it being a film. It's 7/10 as a film with the pacing and holes lowering it as of now, with the next movie maybe help/hurting but as a Star Wars it's 5/10.

"I was excited for this Star Wars. I drove to my local theater through plenty of snow and traffic with some friends to see a movie I'd greatly anticipated. 
Walking in, I felt good, watching the first ten minutes, a high-paced action scene akin to great space battles before it, with great piloting by Poe, timely comedy and sacrifice scenes to boot that brought a new element of sympathy to the random characters we see die that we rarely spare much of a thought about. Had the whole movie been similar to this or even at least have the action scenes follow this mold, I would give this an 8 out of 10. Unfortunately, the final 140 minutes were a narrative mess without any direction or meaning.
Let's start this with some things I really enjoyed about this movie. The acting was fantastic, and you could tell everyone playing their characters really channeled their best efforts into this project. The score was fantastic once again, and so was the cinematography and special effects. The action scenes are well-choreographed, for the most part, and they didn't shove callbacks to the original trilogy as much as they did TFA.
However, once you get past the talented and passionate actors, effects workers, and John Williams, you find a movie truly lacking in the elements that made Star Wars such a great trilogy in the first place. 
I'm glad to see many reviewers also believe that the comedy in this film was sub-par. You never saw the on-the-nose forced humor from this in Empire, A New Hope, or even Jedi. Yoda burns the ancient Jedi scriptures as a joke, and then Luke, despite literally 30 seconds previous he was about to burn it himself, gets mad and tries to save the books. He also throws his lightsaber away when Rey hands it to him, which was cheap. There are just plenty of quips and one liners that aren't needed, to summarize. 
So many characters from The Force Awakens, the original Trilogy or even introduced in this movie are wasted by a script that doesn't know what it wants to do. Finn does nothing in this movie, besides almost run away, have a casino subplot that made no effect on the plot, and fight Captain Phasma for 1 minute. (Phasma was once again criminally wasted, and then killed off.) Maz could have been used in place of Guillermo Del Toro's shabbily introduced and shoved out character, but she was relegated to one scene where she fights off something we have no idea about. Yoda comes in for five seconds and does nothing except crack a few one liners and do what Luke was about to do. Snoke, who was intriguing, mysterious and incredibly powerful to the point where he senses his apprentice's intent? Just some nobody who gets killed off in a manner impossible not to see coming. R2-D2 served no purpose in the movie other than say hi to Luke, Chewbacca was basically some dude who flied the Falcon and couldn't speak, and while Leia actually was treated well in this, her god-like come back to life scene was astoundingly confusing. Poe was used to a serviceable amount, and had at least some character development. Laura Dern's admiral character was perplexing in many ways. She could have told her crew about her plan, rather than not say anything before she loaded the transports which rightly provoked a mutiny. She also waits until most of the ships have been shot down before reaching her plan to go to light speed and destroy the ship. Rose, played by Kelly Marie Tran, was interesting. Her character as a nobody in the Resistance who has seen friends and family die only to see her supposed invincible heroes disrespect that was something that could have been worked with and I hope that unlike many characters from TFA that we see her again at some point in a significant manner. General Hux also could have been used more than he was and was given little to do other than get intimidated by Snoke and Kylo.
The entire subplot with Rose, Finn and the Codebreaker only dragged the movie far longer than it needed to be and could have been shortened greatly with little effect on the movie, or even cut out entirely, since the tracking of the ship no longer was deemed necessary. Also, The Force Awakens leaves off on the Starkiller Base being destroyed, and then resumes in TLJ with the Rebellion being on their last leg, almost completely destroyed with no explanation for how.
Obviously I have to talk about the major deaths in this movie. Rather than kill off Leia respectfully, as she will not be in episode 9, or even in the scene where her cabin gets shot out and she climbs back into the ship somehow, they kill Snoke before anything is revealed about his origins, character or how he got to power. Luke's death, while interesting and needed to close out the plot TLJ was trying to tell with the end of the Jedi, epitomized the wasting of Mark Hamill's talent and love for this franchise. We never know why he gave up so suddenly, or why he wouldn't even contact anyone important from the original gang. Instead, he becomes an unhelpful and resenting hermit completely unlike Ben Kenobi.
Rey and Kylo Ren have the closest thing to character development in the script. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley were once again fun to watch and kept you on your toes, with their narrative of projecting to each other, to their fight scenes. However, Kylo goes from refusing to kill Leia, killing Snoke and helping Rey to immediately fighting her and making power grabs for the First Order. Once Luke's lightsaber explodes, we never see Rey again until she's in the Falcon again with Chewbacca, even though we never see her running away to get in the ship, or boarding it. She also does barely nothing in the final scene, where she definitely could and should have. 
Overall, this movie could have been one of the best movies this franchise has seen, yet instead it only barely holds itself up above the prequels. This is the worst Star Wars movie since Revenge of the Sith.",0.1410381411517776,0.5037586908041455

"This movie is not well received from a big part of the audience. The main critic is that this movie, completely ""destroys"" an old beloved character. I absolutely disagree, with those opinions. 
Personally, I think this star wars movie is a good example of progression. Progression and evolution, from the three previous films that introduced as to the world of star wars. The way it was chosen to do this, in this film, was to ""mess up"" with one of the most known characters of the franchise, and that is totally fine by me, since it was done in a decent manner.
The previous movie, although it was a good movie, it seemed to me far more boring than this one. It was like I was watching ""a new hope"" again, but this time with far better effects. ""The last jedi"", tries to shake things up a bit, and this is why I think it is a better movie than it's predecessor.
However there are, some weak points that cannot be overlooked. First of all, one weak point was the scene with Leia after the attack of the first order fleet to the resistance's vessels. It was pretty bad and excessive, but I I don't want to say any more, you'll see for yourselves. The other point, was the acting of Domhnall Glesson. His acting reminded of a more comedic role than a villainous one. This is a bit of a disappointment, since in the previous movie his acting was so much better.

"Rian Johnson gets a lot of hate, but he did something that hasn't been done since George Lucas had the realm of the franchise, try to make something different. Sure, it has similarities to other films in the franchise. However, Rian didn't play it safe. He tried to make a film that wasn't a carbon copy of the films that came before it. The Last Jedi wasn't about fan service, it was about taking the movies forward and in a lot of unexpected ways. I think this was a brilliant move. The other two installments are nothing but fan service with mindless action and incoherent story. This movie had everything that makes a good Star Wars film. The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars is that the Canto Bight scene seems so unnecessary and derails the films momentum. I actually skip it and don't miss anything from it. Overall a great movie.

Without going too much into spoiler territory, the movie completely disregards 40 years of Star Wars lore (including the movies that came before) ending up feeling disconnected from the Star Wars Universe. Many plot holes and out of character moments will make you dislike the movie the more you think about it.

"I've been a Star Wars fan since it first came out in 1977, so basically, all my life.
I am also a huge Sci-Fi movie fan.
I NEVER considered Star Wars to be a Sci-Fi movie. For me, these movies are Western movies, Samurai movies. 
The original Star Wars drew its inspiration from Kurosawa movies. Unfortunately, back in the 70s, Lucas had just a couple of millions to realize his vision on screen.
THE LAST JEDI is just that: big budget Samurai-War-Western movie that takes place on alien worlds. 
It brings the essence that inspired the whole saga to another level. It's the ANTI-prequel movie. It will anger Star Wars fans that read all the books, the comics and see Star Wars as Sci-Fi flicks.
It will confuse A LOT of viewers... children will often be lost with that one.
It is gloomy, full of symbolism, artsy...BOLD. 
I never felt that way about a Star Wars movie since parts of Empire Strikes Back...and not in a ""cliché"" way. 
It has some POWERFUL and MEMORABLE scenes that will leave you speechless. That will stick in your minds for a long time.

Actors are on top of their game.

"People say this movie is really bad. Well I've been a huge Star Wars fan since 1996. When it comes to the original trilogy, I still prefer the original versions over the so called ""Special Edition"". I'm not that crazy over the prequels, although Revenge of the Sith was by far the best of those three movies. At first I was skeptical over Disney making new Star Wars movies, I thought they would end up being big disappointments. I was very wrong, when I saw Force Awakens, it blew me away, it felt great seeing old faces and being introduced to new, likable and mature characters who are willing to learn. No arrogance at all in these characters, something that Anakin Skywalker had a lot of in the prequels. As for the Last Jedi, there are some parts that are questionable, but this movie still kicks so much butt that it makes you forget it. The characters have so much personality, the story has so much drama and suspense, the CGI is outstanding and has so much action. I'm sorry people who hate this movie, but this movie is outstanding. I think if you're going to give a movie a 1 out of 10, that means you are comparing it to something like Manos: The Hands of Fate and that's very unfair. Movies should only get a 1 out of 10 score if they are not only abysmal, but they are also offensive and would have a horrible influence on the youth. I love The Last Jedi and I feel like 9 out of 10 is the right score for it. The good does definitely outweigh the bad and it's easily one of the best movies in 2017. I cannot wait until this movie comes out on Blu-ray and I'm really excited for Episode IX. I also want to wish Carrie Fisher a peaceful afterlife.

"This is NOT Star Wars. The script was painfully bad and the entire film felt like a soulless Disney cash grab. In what feels like a wild attempt to differentiate itself, The Last Jedi borders on being unrecognizable as a StarWars installment. Major questions from The Force Awakens are completely neglected and character development takes a backseat to explosions and jarring ""twists"" that don't surprise but rather leave you feeling frustrated and confused. The main problem seems to be that The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi feel completely incompatible with one another, as if the directors were in a fued. All of the questions posed by The Force Awakens are deliberately neglected throughout the film minus a few. The 2.5 hour run time seemed fine before going in as it was assumed the extra time was needed to go deep into the backstory of many of the characters and questions posed by The Force Awakens. Instead it was wasted on pointless subplots and uninteresting characters. It was difficult to sit through the entire film and remain interested. There were also some bizarre moments that completely ruin the ability to take this movie seriously: flying space Leia, green alien breastmilk drinking Luke, tossing the saber over the shoulder, snokes pointless and unrealistic fate. All of these things coupled with the totally out of place humor make this an unenjoyable film. The humor robs the audience of any chance to take the film, The Force or the Jedi, and the villains seriously. Not to mention, it usually misses the mark and is not genuinely funny. It feels forced and out of place. Like a constant self mockery that borders on deliberate trolling of the serious mythos embraces by the fans. 1/10 because they had an easy lay up from Abrams to make a great movie, wasted Mark Hamil, Andy Serkis and Gwendoline Christie (she gets about 2 mins of screen time) and created a soulless and fundamentally bad film with a budget of $300 million+.

"I'll admit, I'm a Star Wars fan. Not an ultra-mega-fanboy fan--just a regular, mortal fan who maybe read some EU when I was a kid.
So when I walked into The Last Jedi, I tried to be pragmatic about it. Of course I wanted to be floored a la Empire Strikes Back, but I was prepared to be simply entertained like I was by Rogue One or, to a lesser extent, The Force Awakens. Sadly, when the movie was done, I left really disappointed. While I absolutely agree that the film delivered great special effects and exciting moments, I found much of the plot to be forced and hollow. 
Some of my complaints are problems with modern action movies in general. For instance, the original SW movies spent enough time in each setting to establish some sense of place. For example, when Luke trained with Yoda, it actually felt like he had been training for long enough to gain some knowledge. In these new movies, one or two lessons and boom: Jedi Knight. Then it's off, breathlessly, to the next contrived problem.
Other issues, however, are specific to this movie: character overload, corny jokes, unnecessary plotlines, a stupid premise, Laura Dern's character (why?). Where critics gush over ""Nonstop Action!!!!"" I was thinking ""This movie is just throwing stuff at us because it doesn't know what else to do."" It like, when the writers outlined the story, they were just like ""and then, this! And then, this! And then, this! And then, this!"" and so on, ad nauseum. It felt more like Marvel or Fast and Furious than Star Wars.
And that's what really bothers me--the series feels lost from a story perspective. The Empire had this great, rich history as the benevolent Republic turned fascist. The First Order, in comparison is just thin. It seems like something writers came up with to deliver ""Star Wars"" action. There has to be a bad guy, so let's just write one in. Oh and we'll need stormtroopers.
Star Wars is supposed to go somewhere. Trust me, I'm no fan of the Prequils, but in comparison, at least they knew where they were going. The issues with the Prequils were mostly technical-bad acting, bad directing, a bad script-whereas the issues with this new series are both technical and fundamental. 
Is it the worst Star Wars movie? In absolute terms, no. It's still more watchable and enjoyable than any of the Prequils. To be fair, I loved Adam Driver's character and I thought the Snoke plot twist was brilliant. But in exchange, Star Wars has sold its soul. Disney is churning out Star Wars-flavored cotton candy. It's all sugar, no substance. And given that these movies are the last opportunity to use much of the original cast in a meaningful way, that's really sad.
Finally, I'll focus on the real world for a moment: I don't understand why this movie has gotten such good reviews from critics. Maybe Disney's scare tactics really have moved the needle on intimidating publications out of writing bad reviews. In any event, with all the praise and the giant box office opening, there's no reason that the same formula won't be used again and again in the many future movies currently planned.

"He movie is absolutly terrible.
Disney brutally murderes our most beloved childhood memories and has a laugh while doing so.
(1) Our favourite heroes act totally out-of-character. Watch Rotj (Epsiode 6) before and you will see what I mean. It is just terrible to see what Disney has done to the #1 hero of my childhood (Luke Skywalker). I know understand why Mark Hamill said he fundamentally disagrees with everything Rian Johnson (the director) has done to the character and I think it is an understatement.
(2) The movie is spammed by over commercialized stupid humor. What might work in Marvel movies (of which i like most) has no place in Star Wars.
(3) The story doesn't close any loose ends but creates even more.
(4) The movie often shocks for the sake of shoking instead of going along with the story.
(5) Star Wars was always conceived to be based on a steoretypical hero-saga and as a movie to teach moral ideals. This is simply not the case anymore.
(6) The Soundtrack is still John Williams, but we certainly know better from the Maestro.
(7) The story is written in a way as to devalue and annihilate everything the protagonists of the first 6 movies have fought for. Like Disney would want to make people forget that there were even SW movies pre-Disney.
(8) Disney/Kathleen Kennedy/LucasFilm promised for the last 3years that the whole point of rebooting the Canon (except for the 6 movies) is to make them more coherent which is a blatant LIE after this movie.
(9)The only good thing about the movie :The acting was professional, really good and the actors were really in their roles.

Luke didn't feel like Luke at ALL, we still don't know who Snoke is and now he is dead, Rey received zero training of any kind yet is still excellent with a lightsaber and the most powerful jedi (clearly done because Rey is a female), Kylo Ren is a weak baby, Leia flying in space..??, and an anticlimactic death for Luke Skywalker who really should have been showcased as the most powerful Jedi because he EARNED that position - Rey didn't.

"When Disney and Abrams restarted the Star Wars saga in 2015 with Force Awakens, they gave us a delicious, candy-like confection that gave us everything we loved about the space opera: adventure, earnestness, humor, and lots of space action. Now, with venerated filmmaker Johnson at the helm, Last Jedi is something decidedly-less immediately pleasing, though undoubtedly heartier. The nature of good-and-evil, the import of passing-time, the difficulties of truth. Sure, it's not quite revelatory, but it reaches for it...and is plenty of fun along the way.",0.4333333333333333,0.5092592592592593
"Watching a battle in this movie is ridiculous. They make sure to cut to every race and gender, but no aliens. They might as well have been fighting around our own moon. The men are moronic, only the women are intelligent. They portrait the men as just wanting to blow things up without thinking and are regularly outsmarted by these super genius women. The bridge of the main resistance ship is 100% women, no aliens, NOTHING. Imagine watching Episode 4, without Mos Eisley, without the Aliens helping in the final battle. Imagine Return of the Jedi with no Jabba the Hutt Palace. Everything that made star wars unique and special is dead. They are now complaining about animal cruelty of alien racing animals, and worry about freeing them when the movie was seriously lacking at that point already. If Star Wars 4 were half as bad as this, that would have been the end of everything star wars decades ago. This movie makes Episode 1 look like a masterpiece. Real shame, I grew up watching these and was born in the beginning of the 80s. This movie is so bad I wish they didnt even make 7, they ruined it. I was super excited to see this and took my son.

"I think that there is a very clear message that Disney wanted to put through with this film; they want money. And if that means sacrificing the quality of arguably the biggest franchise in the world in order to add Porgs or crystal foxes and unnecessary, poorly timed sitcom-esque jokes to satiate the taste buds of a younger audience craving for the next action sequence to happen, that's what they're going to do, and it's proven in the second film of the new Star Wars trilogy. But, seeing how Disney is now going through the process of purchasing Twentieth Century Fox, and becoming one step closer to monopolizing the entertainment business, they also know that they need to spend some money to make money. And I think the money shines the strongest in how this film looks. All of the sets are beautiful and crafted to the minutest detail. Every inch of the environment on the screen has something interesting to look at, helping to add to the fact that Star Wars takes place in its own universe and that other things happen outside of the plot given to us. Going off of how things look, the special effects were brilliant as well. Every explosion, laser beam, and alien in the film looks real. This made all three of the climaxes incredible. Aesthetically, barring the almost ubiquitous product-placement feel of Porgs, this film was almost flawless. And Rian Johnson really makes the mystical environments shine with thoughtful camerawork and interesting visuals. To top it off for positive comments, the returning characters, Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Luke (Mark Hamill), and Leia (Carrie Fisher (RIP)) all gave good performances and I enjoyed the new characters as well, especially Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). I can also appreciate that Disney is bringing tasteful diversity to this movie in all of the new characters. Perhaps I'm being cynical because I think it might be in order to drive more cattle, I mean people, to see it because they feel it's a ""progressive movie"" they need to support, but I will try and push that out of my head.",0.26775777253049987,0.5603440246622065

"As a fan of ""Looper"", Rian's earlier film, I was actually looking forward for his take on this Epic. But what turned out is utter garbage. The comedy is flat and shoehorned which was a major turn down. Following Episode 7, i was expecting some sort of tense epic film that would address the questions raised by the earlier film. But what followed is a dumb needlessly talkative film, that neither tried to be smart nor cared to move the plot further. The plot holes OMG are so huge and instances that popped out of nowhere, that would make a micheal bay movie a better option. The acting is good, which is expected of a great cast. But it all feels very disjointed. Finn & new addition rose sub plot is awfully absurd to say the least. As a star wars fan, i expect whizzing dazzling action set pieces which in this movie are none. Not even a decent battle. The snoke bodyguards fight could have been a great one but a completely wasted opportunity. PLEASE DONT GO IN BELEIVING THE CRITICS. Its clearly Disney paid propaganda.",0.09517960995233721,0.49428156019065117
"The eighth episode in what is now being dubbed the Skywalker Saga, The Last Jedi takes the space-opera series into darker, less traditional territory. The nostalgic adventure of Force Awakens is replaced by a harsher, more ferocious tale of good and evil. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is beginning her Jedi journey with a gruff and reluctant Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill); Kylo Ren's (Adam Driver) fractured psyche is worsening as his ambitions clash with his past; General Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) struggle to keep the Rebel Alliance alive; and Finn (John Boyega) continues his self-discovery with the help of newcomer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran). Obviously there's a lot going on, which causes the runtime to balloon out, but writer-director Rian Johnson balances it relatively well, fleshing out a raft of characters and plotlines whilst ensuring the overall story arc is compelling and cohesive. It's definitely the most intense (and arguably the most unpredictable) Star Wars instalment since Empire Strikes Back, the Rey-Kylo-Luke connection a harrowing deep-dive into guilt, vengeance and pride that's as intelligent and mature as it is emotionally hefty. Johnson kicks the action up a gear too. The opening space battle is suitably epic; a silent light-speed sequence is breathtaking; a heroic Luke-centric set piece is spine tingling; and the climactic melee (with vibrantly contrasting reds and whites) is a fittingly awesome finale. There are some flaws, however, that stop this movie from being brilliant. Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) is criminally underused again, whilst thief DJ (Benicio del Toro) and Leia's second-in-command Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) are odd additions whose screen time feels like it was reduced heavily in the editing room. There's also a strange subplot that delves into class divide, a very unwise decision to have Finn and Rose ride on horse-like CGI creatures (in a completely unnecessary set piece), and a ridiculously mawkish final scene that feels tacked on by the studio. He doesn't get it right all the time every time, but when he does-and that is pretty often-Johnson crafts a Star Wars outing that is exhilarating, poignant and dramatically satisfying. The Last Jedi is well worth a trip to the cinema.",0.1566468253968254,0.5597718253968254
"I am a longtime Fan and for me this is the worst Star Wars movie and the most disappointing! And after seeing Rogue One (which was great) i was expecting a better movie and a lot more answers!
Rolling Credits started saying the resistance was already overun by First Order Army Offscreen between Epi 7 and 8! Sadly i wanted to see some of the Fight and in 2h30 hours movie they should include it; Then the movie starts with Poe Dameron being heroic or suicidal teasing Hux or Hugs; 1 minute of the movie saying i want to speak to General Hugs! And Hux replies: This is Hux are you not hearing me? Hugs is what a Teddy Bear? (Hux really acts like a Ted being the most useless and ridiculed villain of all time so Hugs is a good Nick for him)
Guess what? Kids on the theatre didnt get the joke!
Poe was gaining time to prepare a attack but shouldnt the First Order just shoot on sight a easy target such as 1 Tie-Fighter!?
Then Poe Alone starts destroying every Turret in a massive Ship!
Reviews criticize the Avengers type of jokes but i personally think those werent exageratted and because the movie as such low pace were a comic relief to what was happening on screen (Han Solo made a lot of one liners and they were the best) so i can escuse this! A lot of scenes in like Epi 7 were rehashed from previous movies; this time scenes from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi!
Examples: Beggining of the movie starts with a evacuation like Epi 5 but we dont get to see a lot of it in this movie!
Luke training Rey is a copy-paste of Yoda-Luke training in Epi 5: Training with rocks! theres a cave of the Dark Side and even Luke like Yoda before refuses to Train Rey;
The scene in the Throne Room between Rey Kylo and Snoke is a direct copy from Return of the Jedi;
 Snoke tries to convert Rey and tortures her the same as luke with the Emperor and Rey acts the whole time like Luke (You still have a conflict i can fell it there still good in you)
The Problem is that this scene in Epi 6 was the epic Climax Ending and this time is in the Middle of the second movie of a trilogy wtf! Complains: 
The Movie almost happens all the time in Space with Two Ships Persuing one another and on Lukes Island! I actually liked Canto Bight the Casino World but what a missed opportunity for a Lando Calrissian Cameo (hes a known Gambler) The Scriptwritters didnt answer any questions from Epi 7 in a satisfying way!
 This movie as No Climax! There is no Real Lighsaber Fight the action in this movie is really weak and character devellopment is pretty short for everyone!
 The FX were on par i even think that Epi 7 had better effects! 
The Ending of the movie is disapointing with the Battle of Krait being the lamest battle of all Star Wars Franchise!!
Key Characters Role:
Hux: Is he a General? Both Snoke and Kylo ridicules him in front of his troops when he makes a mistake and Ragdoll him like a Teddy with the force! Glesson is not a good actor at all and being the character a fool doesnt help;
Phasma: Why put her for 2 minutes just to die again in a ridicule way? Ok we got to see Gwendoline Eye this time! What a lame villain she is just Cannon Fodder! Talks bla bla fights a few seconds and gets blown up! Disney you got a action figure;
Finn: His backstory is interesting; a Renegade Stromtrooper who left the First Order because he doesnt want to be a part of genocide! 
The problem is instead of having a Badass Character wanting revenge against the First Order we get a comedy character close to Jar Jar Binks! In this movie he is a moron and i didnt found him funny at all! The Canto Bight Trip was entertaining even if it was a Wront Turn in the end; When they enter the First Order Ship with Dj i was expecting for Finn to wear is old Stormtrooper outfit like luke and han did in Epi 4; that would have been really cool;
In the end Finn tried to Redeem by Sacrificing himself to save the Resistance in Krait by going Kamikaze against the mini Deathstar Cannon Thingie! But Scriptwritters in the name of Disney Kids ruined the Ending for me! It would have been a dignifying death for Finn and a better ending for this boring Battle; But No he is one of the Good Guys and cannot die! Lets make the Finn and Rose Kiss instead! 
Also Phasmas battle is almost as big as the scene shown in the trailer; but in the the trailer it has a lot more impact! Im not lying! 
Rose: A new Character with great moral values and we got a satisfying backstory about her in Canto Bight; Also her sister get a heroic death in the beggining of the movie in that Bomber! The love interest for Finn is kind of forced; so she admires him for being a great Legend (What? For how long i mean? He was in a coma for 2 months maybe?) And she works on maintenance but in the end she is also a Pilot!? 
Shes the best develloped character and that shows how weak the plot is;
Dj: Benicio Del Toro the little time he had on screen showed that he is a great actor! Dj seemed to me the closer we will get to a Han solo character (a scoundrall) His intentions were only to save his own ass but in that scenario that is pretty acceptable; and he says to Finn that being noble leads to nothing! Hope Dj returns in epi 9;
Maz Kanata: Loved her in Epi 7 and i thought that in this movie we would learn why she was so Force Wise! But she only appears in a hollogram for 1 minute and yet she shines being a Badass!
Poe Dameron: Scriptwriters make Poe the best pilot in the universe even better than Darth Vader ridiculous!! Alone he can take all the First Order fleet for Fools; and contradicts all the leading Woman not obeying any orders! (After Leia the Chain of Command is followed only by women) It just doesnt make any sense is actions; he acts like a crazy strong Jedi but without the superpowers! I have Bb8 on my back and i am fearless! 
Chewbacca: Besides interaction with Porgs he gives Luke a Hug and thats it; poor Chewii he lost Han and the scriptwritters respect!
Yoda: When he appears he looked like a lunatic! But what Yoda said to Luke made perfect sense and he even said lines from the past movies; so i liked him for returning even for just 2 minutes! Yoda CGI was strange;
Holdo: Has Pink hair! Says a few motivational words to the crew and Sacrifices herself by throwing the Ship against the Ships of First Order in Lightspeed!? Wtf! If that is possible why dont they throw a few Kamikaze Tie Fighters instead? Also doesnt the ship have auto-pilot? RIP Admiral Ackbar is Dead now the only Male to rule the Resistance! 
Leia: Shes ok most of the time! But the Scene shes blown into Space is terrible & the CGI is really bad and Leia is not Force Strong enought to do that magic! She started to frozen so it would have made a lot more sense that the Force would create a bubble barrier and kept her in a suspended sleep till someone rescued her; it would have been unrealitic but much more believable!
And i dont understand why she lived? They could let her die in this scene in space making it a emmocional scene and it would have been a lot more respectfull for Carrie Fisher; because she past away now they will have to make a Offscreen Death in Epi 9 or make a CGI Leia and i believe that wont work at all!
Luke Skywalker: Mark Hamill is the best character and actor in the movie! Hes a Bitter man and feels responsable for the Downfall of the Jedi Temple and the Rise of the First Order & i accept that he went to isolation on a island gave up and closed himself from the force! People hate that Luke throws the lightsaber away! Say it is Offcharacter but in the context of him refusing everything from the past its a logical reaction! The scene with R2D2 (Easter Egg) is very touching and humanizes Luke making him to decide to train Rey! But why didnt Luke go with Rey and help the Resistance and have a Final Clash with Kylo like Ben vs Vader did? That would have been Amazing! Instead we get a Force Projection where we tricks Kylo and avoids him all the time only for the Resistance to escape Krait and by consequence drains Luke Lifeforce and he Dies absorbed by the force like Yoda and Bem! Luke will Return as a Force Ghost in Epi 9 for sure;
Rey: We still dont know who she is or where her force powers come from! I Believe that Kylo lied to her and i think she was made how Anakin was made; The Mind Conection with Kilo Ren was weird like platonic atraction and that was strange to me!Because they are Rivals & Kylo killed Han (a Father figure she like) and yet shes ready to forgive Kylo who is a Psychophat Maniac?? Not Believeble and i still dont know what Disney want from this!? And what a great training she got from Luke Lol
Snoke: Gets Killed by Kylo Ren in the Middle of the movie Wtf! For me this is a Twist! I think hes still alive and is Darth Plagueis; the momment before his death he was feeling Kylo and Rey thoughts it seemed that he was in perfect control; manouvering Rey like a puppet her force powers and kylos were no match! This was a test for Kylo Loyalty! Because if Snoke really died without any answers of who he really is and where he came from this will be the worst Plot i have ever seen!! Why all the mistery in Epi 7 behind Snoke? Scars cuts & being Tall and Thin all matches Plagueis description and Snoke speech is almost identical for the Emperor lines;
Kylo Ren: He didnt learn anything! Proof is Krait were he looses control and orders everyone to shoot Luke and attacks his Projection without any Tactic just Raw anger and blindness! A well trained Jedi with good lightsaber skills would defeat him easy; even the Red Minions in the Throne Room (Maybe Knights of Ren?) were hard to defeat! Hes just a Vader Wannabe with anger management and daddy issues; hes no Leader just a bully with powers! I really prefer him with a Mask on!
Overall i give Epi 8 - The Last Jedi a Score of 6. Please Disney listen to the fans and Give us a EPIC ending!

"This is the most underrated film of the Star Wars Series. Why? Ok, let's see: First, the development of Luke Skywalker as a somewhat broken hero is very interesting and Mark Hamill's portrayal of this is actually very nice. Probably everyone who has watched the other films, me included, expected something different. While I was, at first, annoyed by this like many others, this development has actually grown on me: Imagine alternative versions of the story where Luke happily joins the Rebels once more and does great things from the beginning - wouldn't that feel kind of boring and, given the story of The Force Awakens kind of implausible. Just imagine an alternative version of Star Wars V where Yoda joins the rebels on Hoth - wouldn't that kind of make Luke superfluous? In the end, Luke manages to save the rebels some time with a very powerful force projection in a very powerful scene where he fights Kylo Ren, but only after he had to learn throughout the film that passivity, after all, is not the solution to the problems of the universe. Before that, we see two different versions of the final moment between Luke, as a teacher, and Ben Solo/Kylo Ren as his apprentice, one from the perspective of Luke and one from the perspective of Kylo Ren through they eyes of Rey - which provide some credibility to Luke's withdrawal from the world.
Second, Daisy Ridley as Rey is really, really great! Her dialogues with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, also great!) via the Force are really intense and provide some variety to the tempo of the film. Also the scenes with Rey and Luke at times are funny as well as serious enough to provide room for both characters to be developed further. Also, the scene where Rey seeks answers in the well are well designed and acted and provide an appropriate feel of mystery.
What I don't care for is the opening ""joke"" with Poe Dameron and General Hux, but that is quickly forgiven as this sequence progresses with the introduction of space bombers and the excruciating scene where one after the other bomber is being destroyed. With this scene, the opening of the film already manages to provide a thrilling battle scene, which is apparently no easy feat, and there are many more to come in the film.
Also, the The Last Jedi is visually very convincing and innovative as well. Think of the scene where Admiral Holdo jumps into hyper-space in order to crash into the fleet of the First Order. Or, think about the battle-scenes on the salt-planet with red beyond a white surface culminating in Luke's battle against Kylo Ren or the lightsaber battle in the throne room. These scenes feel very intense as well, due to the convincing choreography (one can actually follow what is happening) and the impressive scenery they are set in.
In sum, Rian Johnson manages to tell the story in a way that feels intense - both emotionally with respect to character development and with thrilling action sequences. Also, he manages to bring some feel of mystery back into the force (also thanks to Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill) which was largely absent from the prequels.",0.23487698412698405,0.6078373015873016
"People have made this movie the scapegoat for everything that was ever wrong with star wars. People see the original trilogy as an absolute masterpiece without flaws, and while there was nothing like the original three movies when they came out, the way people worship them is bothersome.
Now, i also recognize a lot of the things wrong with The Last Jedi, there is a lot of 'stupid' in this movie, and the setup this movie gives for the one after is absolutely atrocious.

Then the silly plot line starts with Finn and Rose where they had to go to some planet in search of a code-breaker(DJ) another boring character, the whole purpose of doing this was waste.

Then there is killing of Snoke by Kylo Ren, you never get to know who he was.
Rey is just the same, no character development. The FORCE connection between the characters was bit odd. And the movie was too long.

In this movie, I was hoping for a wise Luke. Someone to help Rey. But he went back to a weird whiny character. Or at least just ruined. He doesn't seem how he should be and there were moments that were just cringy. There's a scene where Rey follows him and he gets this weird green milk from this..

"For the first ten minutes of this movie, I was left unamused and mostly disinterested, and prepared myself to regretfully hop on to the more mild mannered back of the 'Last Jedi is trash' (mostly internet) bandwagon, but as the film went on, my opinion totally flipped around. I was entertained and surprised and I fell in love w/the film's strange, messy style. It was so horribly flawed, yes, but that added to the charm. It didn't feel like some kind of cash grab, it felt more like an actual movie made by human hands. And, regardless, it was super fun to watch. And the characters became much more complex and interesting since the last time around. The character dynamics were well fleshed out, various inner conflicts added a certain layer of more impressively thought provoking material that was, to me, very unexpected. I even loved the casino planet material. Although it had no real ""reason"" to be there, I thought it was super entertaining and enjoyable to watch. It is true that a lot of the humor unfortunately falls flat, but I did genuinely laugh a few times during this film (mainly during one great, totally out of the blue sequence featuring a long lost, long loved character I will not name), although sometimes my laughter could have been unintentional oddly enough, but even when this happened I was being entertained. So, even if my opinion is enormously controversial, I refuse to back down from defending this fearlessly bizarre and surprising installment of an over saturated saga that should have ended over 30 years ago, as its originality and ridiculousness and just overall sense of fun (that doesn't really get in the way of its more dramatic material) feel like they practically saved 'Star Wars' from all of the over marketing and the disaster that was 'Rogue One', despite the fact that MANY seem to have expressed an exact opposite opinion!",0.20075908858166922,0.43605350742447513

"Am seriously dumbfounded... Not by the newest Star Wars film, but by the number of people that dislike or hate it. Go figure... 
Maybe I am a more 'casual' fan, light-years from the cosplay, buy-every-action-figure, comic book, and read every SW novel type of Super Fan... But I am a '1st Fan', having seen each SW film since the very first one premiered way, way back in May of 1977. I loved the first movie so much, a high school chum and I even hid out in the theater restroom, right after seeing 'Star Wars', just so we could see the next screening right away... yup! Oh, what memories...
Now, am only going here on my one and only viewing, so far, of The Last Jedi, but I enjoyed it... A lot... In just one word, after it ended, I could only say was: ""Whoa!""
Yes, oh yes, there is a lot in this film that came almost out of nowhere, or maybe from some wormhole in the screenwriters deep-dark imagination... Like the burning of the Jedi Texts (hey, I love old books, so the burning of ANY books, especially ones with mystical/spiritual and other esoteric type of knowledge, just rubs me wrong!). And the part of Leia 'Force-Flying' (?) back to the rebel command ship soon after being blown out into space... well, that was more unexpected stuff, but hey, she is a Skywalker after all, and the other half of Yoda & Obi-Wan's 'Last Hope' (Episode 6, ROTJ). Mostly, I just took all this and more into stride, and simply just watched what was a very cool, action-packed, fantasy/science fiction-filled adventure... I had gone in hoping the movie would be good, but not expecting any certain things to happen, or not happen, in the story or on screen. Just watched SW:TLJ with an open mind & heart, and had a great time... And, I found so much to like in it, like the many new aliens & creatures, vehicles, etc. Basically, it was just a 'Fun Time At The Movies', which was all I really wanted... I got that & more! And so, for now, like Stan Lee says: ""Nuff said!"" (...and May the Force be with You!)",0.17263116281866284,0.5312491582491582
"******SPOILERS AHEAD-WARNED YOU ARE******
Sick. I just felt sick seeing The Last Jedi. 
Still feel sick. Felt so sick, got up in the middle of the night and couldn't sleep. (ended up reading IMDB reviews for 3 hours)
No movie has ever done that to me before.
Why? JJ set up all of these wonderful forewards in TFA, to be left with all of our hopes dashed with no fulfillment, wasted villains, no conflict, nothing.
As Lando said, ""I trusted you to fix it, Rian!"" 
I was led down the garden path by SWCO, praises for Rian, the media hype. It was all hype.
As DJ said, ""It's all a machine.""
Instead of the arms dealers getting rich, it's Disney. 
Instead of Rose and Finn being double-crossed, it is the diehard Star Wars fans.
We were sold out.
The light side: 
1. effects were what I expected 
2. acting was decent (but not Oscar-winning performances we were promised)
3. score was decent (but definitely rehashes every theme in SW with nothing new)
4. Liked Rose a lot (she was a good foil for Finn making his character reconsider his actions)
5. liked that Finn went from running away to running toward the conflict at the end
6. loved Poe's development
7. ""Flyboy"" was not out of place as Leia called Han that in ANH
8. loved the ending (but some things could have been better)
9. loved the Force-bond between Kylo and Rey (and, no, I'm not a Reylo shipper)
10. loved the chemistry between Rey and Poe at the end
11. loved the last scene of Luke
The dark side:
1. The humor was over the top and entirely unnecessary in the Luke/Rey arc (even though I laughed at the ""breathe,"" it ruined the mystique of the Jedi and the Force)
2. The dialogue was so clunky, worse than Leia's dialogue in TFA (and I didn't think any dialogue could be worse than that)
3. No actor direction. Very evident it was ""visionary"" direction, but not character.
4. The main plot: Luke throwing lightsaber over his shoulder?! His attitude ""Get off my lawn""? That works for Hamill being fascetious. It doesn't work for this movie. Rey getting less than 18 hours of instruction? It shows her sleeping twice, but she shows up on Crait at the end. (Continuity issues-you need a calendar for the plot when you write!) The books just being for show and burn? The whole infinity mirror thing? 
5. Finn/Rose subplot-it could have been removed entirely or shortened to making contact with the real MASTER CODEBREAKER and getting off planet fast. MASTER CODEBREAKER should have been Lando. DJ just shouldn't have been. Finn and Rose should have spent more time on the flag ship being chased by stormtroopers, not captured so easily. Cut the whole thing about the horse things and the stable kids (obviously a set up for Rian's upcoming trilogy-which I will not watch).
6. Poe/Leia subplot-loved Poe's humor, but the mother joke has to go. Mutiny should have been expanded and worked. Leia should have either died in space or piloted the cruiser on the suicide mission. AT-ATs and skimmers-yeah, should have been the speeders from Hoth. Should have been a fully engaged battle.
7. I knew we were getting Porgs on the island, but those nun-like creatures and the sea cows being harvested for blue milk? Really? Isn't one cute animal enough for the merchandising profits? OK, the crystal critters could stay, too. But the rest just had to go.
8. Space Leia. Enough said. 
9. Admiral Holdo-artistically, she was strong and a great foil for Poe. It was evident that she and Leia could not been on screen together for a long time-too much wow there. However, even though Laura Dern was perfect in her part, why in the world did they go for another white female? (And I'm a white female, so don't say I'm being racist here.) How many of our strong female characters are white? Could she have not been black or Hispanic? Just scratching my head here.
10. BB-8 saves the day every single time? Really? tying up the guards playing Sabacc? shooting out gold coins? commandeering an AT-ST? How did he get in there? We were pandered to with all of those scenes.
11. The anti-white man slant here. It is one thing to include a variety of races and more females, but it should not have been at the expense of writing every white man as incompetent, loony, or weak. It just shouldn't have.
12. Snoke's death. What a waste of an amazing villain. Give him a backstory. Give us hints in VIII and full-on reveal in IX.
13. Hologram Luke (I knew immediately when he had the brown beard with Leia it was a projection). Why couldn't he have raised his X-Wing and joined the fight? Why couldn't he have faced down Kylo Ren for real? Even if Ren overcame him because he was old, it would have been a better way. Also, they could have left him injured (instead of Rose), so we all wonder if he will survive long in the next film. This was just the wrong way to do it. (I did like his peaceful death scene, though. Way to go on the full lotus, Hamill.)
14. The Slowest Space Chase in History. It was a waste of film. Plot holes galore. How about the First Order cripples the cruiser, they escape to Crait (which is an abandoned Imperial base), etc.? Spend time on Crait showing how they think they'll win. Give them enough technology to get an early tiny victory. Cheated on this. So cheated.
15. When the Flag Ship is hit, I really hated that black-and-white sequence. It was shoving it our faces that Rian Johnson was this visionary photographer. It jerked me out of the movie yet one more time. Stop trying to be so artsy and tell the story! 
That's what made the original trilogy great-George specifically did not make Star Wars like the sci-fi of the 70s that spent long minutes photographing beautiful sets and locations and effects. He made a mistake with the prequels when he thought that we wanted those beautiful sets and locations and effects at the cost of the story. Rian, you made that fatal error, too. I was trying to identify where this film fits in my list of likes. 5, 6, 7, 4, 3, R1, 2, 1, 8
What's really sad is I thought this was going to the best Star Wars movie ever made with the mysticism back and the dark tones and tons of character development with a compelling plot. I'm crying right now as I realized how we've been cheated and lied to.
JJ, it's not too late. You can still change this around.
How to fix this:
1. Rey has to make mistakes, and those mistakes must hold dire consequences for her. Like Luke ignoring Yoda's warning and losing an arm and finding out the truth about his father when he wasn't ready for it. Like Luke ready to stand for the right at the end of ROJ, even if it meant painful death. 
2. Rey has to be a person of importance. Kylo Ren's explanation does not coincide with the Force vision. Since 5 minutes earlier Snoke says he was manipulating both their minds, make it so that Snoke put this false information in both of those. Rey was waiting for her family to return in TFA. They left. We saw it. I don't care if she's Luke's kid he didn't know he had or Han's kid at this point, but Anakin's lightsaber calling to her proves she is Anakin's granddaughter.
3. You have to give motivation for Kylo Ren turning entirely evil and focused on destroying Luke Skywalker at the end. His motivation was finding Luke before, but not killing him. Killing started after he killed Snoke. Plagueis survives by the apprentice killing his host body and the spirit of Plagueis possessing the apprentice. That is the key. Don't mess this up.
4. Recast Leia for at least a few minutes in the beginning of the film. She has to tell Rey who she is or at least give her clues that lead Rey by the end of the film to find out who she is.
5. There is no way Luke decided to just kill Kylo Ren as a sleeping teenager. There had to be more of a motivation: Kylo threatening the love of Luke's life, or injuring her, or something. That would give proper motivation for Luke to exile himself.
6. No more Hasbro money pits. Just stick to the story. Leave out the furry creatures. Make Chewbacca ferocious again. A vegan he ain't.
For IX, I will be looking for spoilers, instead of avoiding them. If it doesn't have what I'm looking for (see the 5 points above), I'm not giving Disney another dime. End of story. You have one more shot in my book to get this right.",0.11769022851112404,0.47897256143524797
"Finally went to see the film and had a huge feeling of disappointment. I expected to get some answers to questions from Force Awakens but don't get any - have to wait for the next movie, I guess - and that is aggravating. I felt I was actually watching a reboot of Empire Strikes Back - plot lines were so similar it made me wonder if the studio could not come up with an original script and story line so they just revamped the ESB script.
The good - acting is very good, special effects very good, action sequences done well.
The not-so-good - there are several so I don't want to bring them all up, but I got the feeling several times where i thought, ""Why did that person just do that?"" Or ""Why didn't they do that a lot earlier?""
The bad - I am not convinced that Finn, Poe, and Rose can replace the original cast members moving forward. Their characters are not as interesting and some of their actions and/or abilities just don't make sense - nothing against the actors, only the characters. Especially Rose - a maintenance worker who can suddenly fly a ship at light speed and a speeder in an attack - huh? Don't you need a little bit of training to do that?
As a standalone film, it wasn't bad - mainly due to decent action and special effects. But considering it is a Star Wars franchise movie, it was very disappointing.",0.14722582972582973,0.5314502164502164

"I am writing this review mainly to refute those venomous posters on IMDB that displayed frustration with the movie's lack of clarity and dismissive storyline. 
Let me start by saying that The Force Awakens was less of a sequel and more of a second act in a larger story. 
I too was hoping for more answers after the enticing seventh episode (The Force Awakens) and was initially mildly disappointed when I left the theater with more questions than clarity. 
After digesting the movie for a couple days, I have come to the conclusion that we might just have to wait another couple years to learn more about some of the more mysterious characters and plot-points. No, we didn't learn a darn thing about Snoke, but that doesn't mean we won't in the final installment. No, the Knights of Ren were absent, but I also believe this will come to fruition. 
Taking on the Star Wars brand comes with tremendous responsibility, and Disney has done a remarkable job as chief caretaker since taking over in 2014. Much of the negativity from hardcore fanboys comes from an emotional perspective, and I can sympathize with that. However, it's important to trust the process. Things will flesh out and we will gain a better understanding of TFA after the Eposide 9 comes out in December of 2020. Think of it this way: You can't fully enjoy a piece of art until the entire picture has been painted. It's pretty much that simple.
Now, as a movie, TFA was technically flawless. The visuals, transitions, battle/fight scenes and imagery were excellent. The acting was top-notch and the sound was, as always, inspiring and realistic. I was a little disappointed with Luke's character, and the milking scene was a little ridiculous, but I don't think he was portrayed as terribly as many people are saying. The movie dragged on a bit as well. Three different times I thought it was going to fade to black and roll credits only to have another climatic 10-minute scene. I'm not saying I'm upset with his, merely making an observation. I mean, the more Star Wars, the better, right? 
My biggest struggle as a fan is the fact that Luke and Han are now gone and Leia is on her way out as well. The Skywalker story has run its course and the ever-nostalgic Star Wars fans have to re-adjust and embrace the new generations of characters.

"I believe this film is divisive because it's different. Some people like the risks it takes, and some people think it deviates from what Star Wars is. Personally, I appreciated its boldness and its willingness to take risks. One of my biggest problems with The Force Awakens was that it pretty much followed the Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope formula. In my eyes, it played it safe. But I do understand why some would be turned off by The Last Jedi. It does try new things, and that won't work for everyone. However, I personally found the good outweighed the bad, and there was a lot more good in the film than bad. But there will be people who disagree specifically on what are the good parts and what are the bad parts. The Last Jedi, moment by moment, asks itself what the complete opposite thing anyone would have expected them to do is, and then does it. But this isn't simply for the sake of doing so, but rather it all serves the story and the narrative Rian Johnson has crafted. The things that happen in this film come completely out of left field. If you had told me what happens in this movie prior to my seeing it, I would have been angry. I would have thought that it ruined the movie, and it was a disservice to the characters and to the brand. However, upon seeing it in context, and seeing how every choice, no matter how different it may be, serves the story, I'm on board.

"It took me a while before I decided to go and see this eighth chapter of the Star Wars saga and the reason is mainly one: I was afraid, afraid that all those comments and all those reviews of all those disappointed and angry fans were truthful.
But, finally, I went to the cinema, and I never expected what my eyes have seen, perhaps having read all those negative opinions and all those positive opinions allowed me to go without knowing what to expect and certainly they brought me in that movie theater with one but important certainty: ""The Last Jedi"" would have upset the future of this extraordinary saga.
And it's true, it does.
Before seeing it, I told myself that in any way it would have gone, that is, if those changes would have liked me or not, Rian Johnson had great courage and this had to be done, changes had to be made.
Because if the seventh chapter was a real tribute to the original trilogy, a film made by a fan (JJ Abrams) for fans, that was fine (I liked it a lot) because it was no longer a prequel but a sequel waited for almost forty years; this chapter had to give something new to the new generation of future fans of the universe created by George Lucas, had to give them their ""Original Trilogy"" something that in the future can be honored in turn, and this need of change, of fresh air was more than satisfied.
It was virtually inevitable the division (which then took place) between the vast and growing Fandom, which was divided between those who loved this film and embraced the changes it has involved, and who, however, has detested it and has not at all appreciated the distortion of the plot and especially of the original characters, primarily Luke Skywalker. I was terrified of ending up in this second group but, fortunately, it didn't happened.
Honestly after seeing it I do not understand most of the criticisms that have been made: it is true Luke is different from before but this is called development of a character, he can not always remain the same character, it would be monotonous, now he is aged, is a Luke who has spent many years in voluntary isolation, who has been disappointed by himself and by others, who is afraid of being seen as a failure, a Luke who remains stranded amid the mistakes he has made in the past and, above all, in this new phase he must not and is no longer the protagonist but a young person named Rey. In my opinion this is a splendid change of character.
And it is right, as the film says through the voice of Kylo Ren, that the old dies and the new takes its place.
And speaking of Kylo Ren, he in this film, undergoes a really crazy development, turns out to be a much more complex, intriguing and profound character than you could ever think and the same is true for Rey, who is the real protagonist that puts a lot more in the shade Finn, who still manages to find his place.
And also the comedy, so much criticized, of this eighth chapter finds the right place without ever exaggerating or being too disruptive to divert attention or distort the whole thing, also because in reality the comedy has always been part of the universe of Star Wars already from the first chapters; certainly a different comedy and less childish but ""The Last Jedi"" adapts to the success trend, that is the one brought by Marvel and I do not see what wrong is in this, the current generation wants this and in fact this can be seen from the results at the box- office.
Indeed, from all the criticism that I read I would have expected much more comedy, much more childish, and I was afraid, and instead I must say that the comedic timing, as well as being spot on, are well calibrated, are not too many and even for this can make fun and laugh at the right point and with the right dose. In addition, there is the darker component that characterized the fifth chapter and that can be perceived again in several scenes.
Scenes that really leave you speechless, many have thrilled me, others amused, some anguished and still amazed by their flawless technical, visual (extraordinary special effects) and sound (a wonderful soundtrack that, in addition to resume historical themes of the saga, adds new awesome musics that diversify a lot the score of Star Wars) quality.
Rian Johnson directs everything with extreme precision, but also with a lot of imagination and desire to entertain, have fun, and amaze the audience through breathtaking sequences.
I think this is what a Star Wars movie really needs to do, especially now that we've reached a total of eight films + spin-offs.
Like the V, this expands the universe more and more with new creatures, new worlds and new characters.
Of course the film is not without problems: there are some things that deserve an explanation (first of all the scene of Leia that ""flies"" in space and the character of Holdo) but I think and I hope that these various small holes are plugged in the following chapters. On the other hand, we waited almost 40 years for a big screenplay hole to be tapped and then Rogue One arrived, so hope is the last to die.
As far as I'm concerned, this is the best Star Wars on a par with the fifth chapter.",0.167404885087812,0.5177577165382043
"I can see why George Lucas never wanted to make any more Star Wars movies.
How can you improve on perfection? The story dates to the 1970/1980 the reverse hero's journey was told well via a space movie. It was more about Darth Vader's redemption, than about Luke as a hero and this is what makes it so magical as the hero was Darth Vader
The depth of the story could be felt by those seeking an action movie or those looking for a deeper message of personal growth for one's own life journey.
There was a time when all boys wanted to be Luke Sky walker, all girls wanted to be Princess Leia and all angry people wanted to be Darth Vader. Letting go of these childhood memories is hard but something we all must do if we are to grow into adults and tell our own hero's Journey to help and support those around us.
As we grow we pass on the knowledge to the next generation with the hope they live a better life than we did. In other words, Star Wars fans, you need to get over it, as the younger generation will never understand the emotional connect we had with the characters.

"In my review of 'The Force Awakens', I wrote that the major theme of the film was the reaffirmation of the myths and the legends of Star Wars. The irony is that the sequel, 'The Last Jedi' stands on the opposite end of the thematic spectrum. This film is all about the subversion and the deconstruction of the myths, the legends and the force. If 'The Force Awakens' is 'Stagecoach' or Leone's Westerns, then 'The Last Jedi' is a revisionist Western like 'The Searchers' or 'McCabe & Mrs. Miller'. We get to see some beloved characters as tangible, flawed human beings instead of the flawless idea of them as legends. Luke Skywalker's arc and storyline in the film is absolutely brilliant. Johnson doubles down on underlining Luke's dilemmas, insecurities and fears. To me, Luke's descension from the status of the legendary Jedi Knight/Master to being a vulnerable human being made him all the more admirable. Johnson deconstructs the character of Luke, but never disrespects him. But as a non-hardcore Star Wars fanatic, I can clearly see how my opinions regarding Rian Johnson's choice with Luke's character might not be the same as the opinions of a die hard Star Wars fan. For me, this is the first time that a Star Wars film has completely committed to delving deep in the murkiness that lies between the broad strokes of the light and the dark. I loved the explanations given regarding the origins of Kylo Ren's decisions. The film shows how a small moment of weakness viewed from differing perspectives can lead to misunderstandings and subsequently potentially devastating eventualities. I loved everything that Johnson did to connect the three characters of Rey, Kylo and Luke together.",0.11092592592592594,0.4672685185185186
"...is the fact that there were signs of an incredible Star Wars movie buried in this film. It's just completely lost in stupid decisions, dumb character portrayals, and ridiculous plot points. The only time I've ever been this disappointed by a Star Wars movie was after seeing Episode 1 in theaters, but while in my view that movie was just bad through and through, this one could have shined.
First of all, the humor. Humor is not a bad thing in a movie and, in fact, Star Wars generally has good flowing humor between the characters. The problem with the humor in this one is it's not character interaction so much as it is just cheap jokes. There's one at the beginning of the movie in which Poe is acting like there's a communication problem between him and General Hux which makes no sense whatsoever in this universe. In order for that joke to work you have to accept that their technology is no always reliable, but in Rogue One we saw that ships could communicate while in hyperspace, you mean to tell me that their technology may not work ship to ship while next to each other?
Second: Canto Bite. This sequence was so out of place, and it actually showed to be pointless to the story. I think my biggest problem is Canto Bite feels too much like Las Vegas but with people masquerading as aliens. Slot machines and I'm pretty sure they were playing craps. Come on. Where is the imagination here? It's not like you have to go very far, there are tons of references of gambling games in books and other media, but instead it's basically a standard casino from earth. Lame. Did I mention that this whole subplot had no purpose? Yeah, because it didn't.
I honestly could ramble on about this, but I'm just going to stop. This COULD have been an awesome Star Wars movie, but it was lost in some of the dumbest decisions ever made.

"Episode I filled me with dread as a Star Wars fan; The Last Jedi was worse because it ended my continuing status as a Star Wars fan with almost no hope of redemption. Episode IX would have to be an unprecedented movie miracle to repair the damage this movie has done to the Star Wars lore, universe and characters. The Last Jedi is an overly commercialized joke looking to milk the success of the franchise. It wastes or abuses the established characters in order to highlight the new, poorly developed characters. It features horrible logic flaws, ill timed humor, pointless subplots, terribly obvious and sloppy scientific flaws and characters who seem to act almost randomly at times with no consistent motivation. There was nothing about this movie which made me want to see it again and actually I would like to never see it again and erase it from my mind with a Jedi mind trick if I could. Virtually every scene was tainted by a serious flaw in character, plot or execution.

There's 3 main story lines which eventually come together to set things up nicely for the final instalment. Some characters like Snoke could've been used more plus a bit of a background story would've been nice. 
There's the usual spectacular Star Wars set pieces and lightsaber action and some of the dialogue is spectacularly cheesy. There are plot holes but hey ho it's not based on fact is it!!! It certainly isn't a stand a lone film and a viewing of The Force Awakens would be beneficial as TLJ carries on straight from the end of TFA.

However, as a reviewer, I must judge this movie based on how good of a MOVIE it was, not how good of a STAR WARS movie it was. The new trilogy spitting upon the expanded universe has nothing to do with how good of a movie this was. I loved the movie. Several parts could've been done without (such as the Kantobyte section of the movie; it was unneccesary but did not drag on for too long).

But I'm sure I also laughed hard just as many times, if not more. Nothing can prepare you for the emotional ride it takes you on. It's a truly epic journey that has enough plot twists for two movies.

I do believe some of the plot points and battle scenes could have been cut/shortened to reduce the film's running time to under 2 hours.
But the cast is great and the addition of Benicio del Toro (one of my favorite actors) and Laura Dern added a lot, for me.
I enjoyed the humorous parts, and the creatures and special effects were great!

"12/30/17. Finally got to see this in the theater. It was worth seeing on the big screen. While it doesn't break any new ground, it does manage to keep the Star Wars story going. Unfortunately, it does work towards eventually leaving the Star Wars universe with only the new and younger characters it has introduced in what is the third trilogy of Lucas's original concept.

"Picking up from the last one we are immediately thrown into battle and fight between Resistance and First Order. It is spectacular, massive and powerful to watch each scene and how fighting between 'good and evil' goes but in the end if you appreciate previous movies you will feel betrayed and probably get stunned by details but not in a good way. Return of our beloved Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) gives us a new way of confrontation which passes and gets you hyped enough to bite bait and focus on movie. On the other side there are characters that will make you wonder like Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and return of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) can get you real excited until further development or underdevelopment of characters goes through picture. Skywalker's contribution to story is pretty strong and mostly it feels constantly dragged toward his character. Discoveries throughout movie will keep it going and pull your focus to it with some stunningly scenes and landscapes because without any doubt it's one good looking movie. Now to get real with everybody there is so much need to tell you that movie gives some of the pretty laughable, ridiculous and stupid moments that if you really like movies you won't forgive. Rian Johnson, the director, man who also directed and wrote Looper which was fantastic, now gives every fanboy out there a material inside movie that will get them to the skies and beyond. Screenplay and directing done by Rian is fabulous without any doubt, it has some of the greatest fight scenes which look beautiful on big screen and you will definitely remember them. There is only one major criticism about characters is that Snoke got too little time and was so left behind and considering powerful man standing in his seat it could've been powerful performance. Overall experience of Star Wars: The Last Jedi without giving any spoilers that is very tough in such a movie is that it was well written and directed by Rian, followed by great performances but sometimes it felt that Johnson focused too much on fans of saga rather then to give us a more powerful story that he is capable of providing. 3/4 By the way Porgs are absolutely amazing.",0.17797336106159634,0.6446969696969697

The premise behind all the new films ( 'George Lucas ruined Star Wars; if we cut him out and let gifted people do it, Star Wars will be great again') therefore sounds false to me. That's fan fiction.

I'm only sorry Carrie Fisher died because they her character development as General Organa was really good and I wish we could have seen more of her. I like all the new creatures even the sea cows Luke milks on the island. About the plot yes, ok it isn't the most linear and there are few things that could have been handled better like Snoke (who the hell is he and how did he come to power after Palpatine was killed?

I thought this film was genius to make Luke Skywalker not the legend we thought he would be. Mark Hamill also gives the best acting performance of his entire career. I enjoyed the progression in Kylo, Rey, Finn, and Poe as well. Their narratives were unexpected but welcome as it helped them not follow the same tropes as the predecessor heroes from other trilogies.

First of all its the longest Star Wars movie clocking in at 2.5 hrs, add in the 30 mins of trailers and commercials and your investment is a long three hours. 
 Visually it was great, storyline was imho very forced and did not feel fluid. The script was just bad.
 There are some really lame segments in the movie. Finn's little adventure with new character rose was one of those segments. Just boring and unnecessary. Rose character is again a waste of time and shouldn't have even had a role. She feels forced, takes away from finn
Leia flying through the vacuum of space is one of the worst things i have ever seen in a star wars movie. 
The way snoke dies was pathetic.
The way luke dies is even worse.
Humor is forced and unnecessary. Unfortunately there is a lot of bad humor in this movie. 
Benicio del toro is a great actor, he did a fine job as a slicer, but was a waste of time on the big screen. 
Domhall Gleeson is a good actor, but he has not performed in the role of Hux. 
Rian Johnson might be able to shoot a great film visually, but writing a star wars script is not his thing. its as if he shoved too much info into this movie, and a bunch of it could have just been removed and it would have flowed much better.",-0.019092756836659286,0.5135661492978566
"I am much more interasted now with public reactions to new SW, then movies themselfs. First reviewers were unhappy with milking of old story,and now with sudden twists. So there is no way to make them happy. As they couldn't shoot exectly same story forth time, they had to let it go and trust someone with new plot direction. The rules were:1. stratch the soap opera as far as u can 2. disney PG12 3.general SW theme of good vs evil and so on.
And so Johnson did. Bold plot twists, some action, some mystery. On top of that he tried to add some depth to the characters,sadly that did not go well with fans. I wish people would let go their nostalgia and hopes to relive their youth and embrace changes. On the other hand 2.5 hours dint get us anywere. Same problem with all franshises - nothing or no one in this movie makes you care. And after watching it, still hard to explain what exectly the story was here. I realy dont like when they make big movies with soap opera standarts of cliffhanger instead of the finished story.
Basicly rebels just running whole movie and dont get anywhere. Leia still playes no real role and kind of a place holder of a character. Even Snokes death looked more like an exident and definitly lacked dramatism. Also movie for no reson changes rythm and tone several times. Could have better fights, better dialog, better everything.

This is a great movie. Star wars is better. The Empire strikes back is better. The return of the Jedi is also better. The Phantom menace is also better. Attack the clones is also better. Revenge of the sith is also better. Star wars clone wars the movie is also better. The force awakens is also better. Still this movie has great acting. It also has great story line. I also has great special effects. 7.5 is a good ratting. But this is such a great film that 7.5 is underrating it. This is a 9 out of 10. This is better the Rouge One. See all the Star wars movies. They are all good movie movies. Any one who like science fiction stories will like this move. There is some scary space monsters in this movie. See this movie.

"Now, I know I haven´t mentioned this yet but I alove the Star Wars movies, and, let´s be honest, who doesn´t love them, I know people don´t really like the prequels and a bit of The force awakens, but I still like all of them despite the Force Awakens being critisized by most people and Rogue One being my least favorite of the series. But now, is time to talk about The last Jedi.
The plot takes place after The force awakens where Rey is off to be trained by Luke Skywalker, meanwhile, Kylo Ren is I think dealing with decisions in his life if he either wants to stay in the Dark Side and kill his mom, or if he wants to abandon the Dark Side and join the good side, Finn is currently on a mission and Poe Dameron has to deal with a new leader after Leia gets injured. Fwww, that is a lot of plots for one movie, but I´ll talk about that in just a second.
Now, you might be thinking, why exactly is this in the good 2017 marathon, well, because it´s a pretty good movie, it has lots of good action scenes, the acting is fine for a Sci-Fi blockbuster, it does have some funny moments and does expand the world and characters of the Star Wars universe, like giving Kylo a backstory and having a galaxy centered around cassinos and horse-racing, yet still, while this is a good movie, there are still some issues: First off, the plots aren´t very good, for starters, Rey and Luke´s plot felt dissapointing, mostly because in the whole plot, Luke doesn´t train Rey as the trailers said he was and Luke is just portrayed as a grumpy old man who barely listens to what his young cricket has to say, granted, Yoda does appear in this plot but it´s not made up for the fact that this plot is extremely dissapointing, Kylo´s plot is also dissapointing because instead of Kylo joining the good side like the trailer said he would, he just kills his master and becomes bad again after a lightsaber fight with Rey, Poe´s plot serves no purpose to the story other than showing that George Lucas ran out of ideas, to have a repetitive moral of being yourself and to have a tense near death of Leia that says that Carrie Fisher herself isn´t in Star Wars, oh wait, she already died, so what was the point of having her come back to life in the first place, and Finn´s plot serves no purpose to the story either other than to come up with an inviormental message about not abusing animals and to deliver a romance that´s completely pointless other than to add the inviormental message. Another problem is that there´s a lot of filler in this movie, like, for example, the part where they were chasing the snow wolfs who barely appeared in the movie. 
To conclude, The Last Jedi is a good movie, yet it´s not enough to be recomended, while it has it´s pros, it´s definetly not what we expected since the announcements, if you want to watch it for yourself, then go for it, but I suggest watching it on Netflix rather than wasting your money on a Blu-ray or DVD.",0.17559393939393939,0.4275242424242424

Firstly it's beautiful. The film itself to look at is mesmerising, full of stunning scenery, and beautiful shots. Secondly, there are a few (and sadly only a few) amazing scenes. The opening scene with Poe, as well as the whole section on the salt planet Craig. Most of the film I will admit, is not what you'd expect (or want) from a Star Wars film. Confusion, too many plot holes, and a real feeling like the makers didn't know what they actually wanted to do.

There is good emotion, heartfelt, and the fight scenes with Ben Solo are gritty and angry and filled with a lot of passion. Overall, I feel that the creators and the actors put a real nice spin on this ball, giving the viewer and life-long fans, such as myself, closure on aspects of the this story which have been hanging there for decades.

I kinda thought this movie was better than all of the Star Wars Movies and after thinking through the whole movie there were some flaws in it that i didint mention there is a repetitive flaw with Rey and Kylo Ren and also Luke is not the same as he is in all the other movies i dont want to say more wise just more of an a-hole i guess and also another flaw is the ending with Luke if you know what i mean i mean its a great ending but not something i really wanted but it was still good anyway but not as what i was expecting. But those are the flaws of the movie there are so many good things though with the actors portraying Chewy and Rey and many more. I cant believe how good it got in this movie even with the flaws i absolutely loved the special appearance in it. It blew me away and made it so worth it and also the shock with the emperor and how the story unfolds with Kylo Ren its just amazing. Not as many light-saber fights though but still a great movie. So my Re-review is now an 8/10 with giving consideration now. Still a great movie.,0.40228571428571436,0.5418571428571428

He has masterfully constructed a genuis film in its own right while forming the bridge between The Force Awakens and the next installments, continuing to develop the mythology of ""The Force"" and in particular the relationship between Rey (Brilliantly portrayed by the exquisite Daisy Ridley) and Kylo-Ren (Exquisitely portrayed by the brilliant Adam Driver).",0.46802721088435373,0.6423469387755102
"The title sort of says it all in a fashion. There didn't seem to be much new about this episode, except that the audience is introduced briefly to some cute cuddly alien creatures, though even in trailer scene in the upcoming Annihilation (2018) has some even more startling creatures. The theme of self-sacrifice is seen over and over again and the same scenario is repeated like three times throughout the movie. The inclusion of the light charm and witty dialogue from the original Star Wars franchise (1977) is sort of like attempting to bring together the raw grit of Daniel Craig's James Bond's character from Casino Royale (2006) and Roger Moore's light-hearted James Bond from Live and Let Die (1973). There are also logical lapses in the storyline in order to maintain the pace and action, such a necessary delay in reacting to a lethal obliteration of the rebel cause or the cavalier ability of a single rebel fighter to take down a monstrous weapon. The movie sort of has cross between Karate Kid (1984), Gettysburg (1993), and the more formidable fantasy epic Excalibur (1981). The storyline is deliberately somewhat convoluted but for the most part predictable and Princess Leia (?)...well that's whole other quandary. David Lynch's Dune (1984) still retains a manner of sacrifice, convoluted mega-multi-planetary, galactic intrigue, evil power, and the relational bonding and betrayal all wrapped up into one movie while the Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (2005) retain the epic charm of a total immersion into a magical world along with betrayal.

"As a massive Star Wars fan, I, like many other waited with such great anticipation for this film, I loved the trailers and saw the film at midnight on the opening day, my initial reaction was OMG IMDB 1/10. I think the problem is all fans had an idea of where the story should go and it let many down simply because it didn't follow their own expectations. Lets get the negatives out the way, the ""casino scene"" dare I say, is the worst scene from any SW film in history (and that saying something with Jar Jar) ..the bit where BB8 fires the coins ..omg what were they thinking, like many dreadful BB8 scenes, trying to make it far to comical. The second worst scene in SW history is also in this film with Leia flying though space back to her ship! But enough of the criticism, what was good? Ive seen it 7 times now at the cinema, its grown on me to a point where I love it...why? This is a sci-fi film, there is no basis for faulting on whats possible or not as a Jedi, or on real science, in one of the last scenes when the Falcon is battling TIE fighters above a planet surface, the G forces on Rey would knock her out!, nor should you criticise characters actions, like Luke's reaction to Ben turning to the dark side and what followed...if you sit back and enjoy it for what it is and stop looking to deeply into everything you will like it....virtually ever film can be taken to pieces (apart from Alien). For me this film was made by Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren, which is just brilliant, climaxing with his battle with ""Luke"", aided by a great music score. Mark Hamill's performance comes good in that scene, you get the feeling his heart wasn't in the island scenes. Driver's stunning performance is what makes this film though, his Jedi counterpart Rey is likeable and Daisy Ridley's shone in a few scenes, but she doesn't have Driver's intensity, Finn and Poe both play good parts (sometimes with poor scripts and to many silly jokes) There has been a lot of nonsense spoke of the female characters , Carrie Fisher xx we love you and you will always be ""the princess"", Laura Dern as Vice Admiral was tremendous, I can understand the criticism with the Rose character though but given the script/scenes she had, even Liz Taylor would had struggled ! I don't get Phasma this is political correctness gone mad, why out of all the ""male"" storm troopers, Phasma is a ""female"" captain, where did she come from lol (she wasn't helped by her lines)...Anyway watch it again, sit back, enjoy and STOP looking so deeply into everything",0.1438034188034188,0.5480006105006107

"Wow, just wow. 
I am not talking about the movie, it was okay. Just another holiday popcorn sci-fi, no biggie.
No, what I am wowing about is this very awesome, and very original marketing ploy to sell tickets. Someone is a marketing genius over there
at Disney Industries. 
""Hey, let's start an online campaign that appears like fans are panning the 
movie. The 'actual fans' will follow blindly because that is what they 
do...and the next thing you know, we will have a juggernaut at the box 
office because EVERYONE will be talking about The Last Jedi.""
Well, it's working. People are flocking to the theaters to see who's right -
the gushing critics or the die-hard cry-babies.
I would not be surprised if this one breaks the record for profit haul. I am 
sure this idea has been thought of before, but not to this degree of 
success. There is a saying in show business: ""There is no such thing as 
bad press"". 
I am not sure this ploy was needed though. The Star Wars brand is going 
to do well at the box office anyway. But maybe the studio was worried 
about recouping their investment for whatever reason and concocted this 
online blitz idea to hedge their bets?
When the film is viewed in this light, it takes a back seat to an even larger, 
and arguably more interesting, story ~ the story of us, the movie goers.

"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi has been out for a couple of years now, and fans were mostly disappointed by the film. Some regarding it as the worst Star Wars movie ever made. It seems this movie's sole purpose is to set up the end of the trilogy, which is Episode IV - The Rise of Skywalker. The Last Jedi leaves a lot of questions unanswered, and many of the questions that were answered were underwhelming to most fans.

"What I love about this film is that it actually has the balls. It makes bold decisions and takes the franchise in different directions. Sure there are problems, but it's just a movie. It can't be perfect, I believe fans expectations for this film were insanely high. There is no possible way that they were going to do anything like Snoke being Plagueis or Rey being a Kenobi. While it would have been cool it makes absolutely no sense, and means nothing to the story. Not even Luke or Leia knew of Darth Plagueis. They wouldn't care, but the audience would. You shouldn't ever be making a movie for the audience, You should make a well made, and good film, for yourself. And it doesn't matter what fans think, but Disney didn't care at all about that aspect. This is an amazing, well made, beautiful film, with amazing action, humor, and insanely great character development. And I might be the only star wars fan in the world who likes this movie.

"Luke Skywalker takes center stage, returning to the screen (and the rebellion) after what seems like a lengthy hibernation in his family saga's long-awaited eighth episode. Of course, it's a creative wonderland, as all Star Wars movies are. Loaded with brilliant new settings, refreshing spins on old ones, wild unseen alien races and explosive action scenes, it retains its roots in an artistic sense. One particular scene, a lightsaber melee in Snoke's deep crimson throne room, sticks with me as one of the best-directed fights in the series. But there's much more to this picture than mere aesthetics. The Last Jedi constantly defies expectation, seemingly delighting in the chance to throw passionate fans off the scent. From character actions to fake-out non-revelations to the plot's relatively small scale, none of it is quite what I expected. More than once, I caught myself holding my breath, ready to be let down by a decision that seemed inevitable, and each time the film bucked me in a direction I hadn't considered. Sometimes that works to its benefit and sometimes it doesn't. It's a slower, more contemplative take on the franchise, particularly in the first act, which leads to a longer running time (longest of the entire series) without feeling too strung out or overly indulgent. Unlike The Force Awakens, Episode VIII uses its front-and-center returning cast to enrich and enhance the newer faces. Where Han Solo thoroughly dominated the screen, Luke and Leia use two very different methods to help Rey and Poe grow into heroes worthy of taking the spotlight. That's of crucial importance, and that it's missing from Finn's stalled character arc is a problem. Kylo Ren sees significant growth, too, successfully navigating a very delicate balancing act as his interactions with Rey, his light-side counterpart, gradually unfold. Not every gamble pays off, and it's hardly a film without faults, but I appreciate how often it was able to surprise me and its ability to wrangle so many threads together into a cohesive narrative. My first impressions have it a hair above the preceding episode, and on equal footing with Return of the Jedi.",0.13435353535353536,0.5468358585858587
"After being left on a cliffhanger (quite literally) during the late stages of Episode 7 'The Force Awakens', we saw the last hope of the Galaxy, Rey, meet with Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, on a green island surrounded by the ocean, named Ahch-To. This was filmed at Skellig Michael in Ireland. His appearance aged from the last time we saw Hammill in action and his character, who had been away from the Rebellion's business for some time, found himself with his old lightsaber handed to him from a scavenger he had never met before. Knowing that 'The Last Jedi' would entail a journey including the two, viewers enjoyed the comeback of an extreme legend of the franchise. Shortly after the destruction of Starkiller Base, General Leia Organa leads the evacuation of the Resistance forces when a First Order fleet arrives. In his rather bold and confident nature, Poe Dameron leads a costly counterattack, against Leia's orders, that destroys a First Order dreadnought. The remaining Resistance escapes into hyperspace, but the First Order uses a device to track them, and attacks again. This opening is very fast-paced, giving the sense of determination fro, the Rebellion and the constant, ongoing rivalry that they continue to impose on the First Order. Kylo Ren hesitates to fire on the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother Leia's presence on board, but his wingmen destroy the bridge, killing most of the Resistance's leaders. It is clear that Kylo Ren has insecure visions in his head, tilting his brutal nature and tampering with his service to the First Order. These visualisations hint at the possibility of Ren turning good, but he appears determined to serve for the First Order. Leia is dragged into space, following the bridge destruction, and a feature in silence, slowly sees Leia struggling, until she uses the Force and survives, regaining her place aboard the ship. While Leia recovers, Vice Admiral Holdo assumes command of the resistance. Running low on fuel, the remaining fleet is pursued by the First Order. On Ahch-To, we transition from the battle and conflict, turning to Rey attempting to recruit Luke Skywalker to the Resistance. Under self-imposed exile, Luke refuses to help and says that the Jedi should end. Luke seems uncomfortable on the subject of the Jedi and prefers his independent lifestyle, Rey's arrival is nothing more than an inconvenience, however, he is confronted by his old friend, R2-D2 who travelled with Rey, and agrees to teach her three lessons in the ways of the Force. Rey and Kylo begin communicating through the Force, which puzzles the, both, reinforcing the idea that they are somehow connected. Kylo tells Rey that Luke feared his power; Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that Snoke was corrupting him, which prompted Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order, answering for Luke's independence and ignorance toward the Jedi, Ren destroyed all he had left, all the future hope, he thought... Convinced that Kylo is easily turned and can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To. Luke prepares to burn the Jedi library, but hesitates, while considering his actions, the spirit of Luke's master Yoda appears and destroys the library by summoning a bolt of lightning. He, in all his wisdom, encourages Luke to learn from his failure. Meanwhile, Poe entrusts Finn, mechanic Rose, and BB-8 with a secret mission to deactivate the First Order's tracking device. Rose, to begin with, was extremely reluctant by Finn's suspicious actions and opens up to him about the loss of her sister, who played a pivotal role in destroying the First Order dreadnought, sacrificing her own life in the process. Maz Kanata directs them to the casino town of Canto Bight, where they meet with the hacker DJ. Pursued by the local security, they escape the city with the help of stablehand children and racing animals they set free, fitting as Rose admitted to being one of the children herself when she was younger. Finn, Rose and DJ infiltrate Snoke's flagship, but are captured by Captain Phasma. Phasma plays a subtle role in the Force Awakens, being the only person to spot Finn with his stormtrooper helmet off following Jakku, she is blanketed in shining, silver armour with a dark cloak on her back, her structure is the same as a stormtrooper, but her status means an alternative armour design. Kylo brings Rey to Snoke, who reveals that he connected their minds to discover Luke's whereabouts. Holdo plans to evacuate the remaining members of the Resistance using small transport vessels. Believing her plan to be cowardly and futile, Poe leads a mutiny. Leia recovers and stuns Poe with a blaster, allowing the evacuation to proceed. Holdo remains aboard the ship as a decoy to mislead Snoke's fleet as the others flee to an abandoned base on Crait. DJ buys his freedom by revealing the Resistance's plan to General Hux, and the First Order fleet begins firing on the evacuation transports, destroying many. Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke after shaping towards Rey, the two defeat his Praetorian Guard with her help. Rey hopes that Kylo has abandoned the Dark side, but instead asks her to rule the Galaxy with him. Staying loyal with the Resistance, Rey refuses, she battles him for control of Luke's lightsaber, bisecting the weapon. Holdo sacrifices herself by slicing through Snoke's flagship at lightspeed, crippling the First Order fleet. Rey escapes the destruction while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. We are confronted with numerous occasions of Ren being pretentious, for example, killing Han Solo was just a cover up to show is ruthlessness and dedication to the First Order, he wants to join Rey, but not in the Rebellion, yet, takes the Supreme Leader, suggesting that he doesn't know what he truly wants. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose; they defeat Phasma and join the survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn and Rose attack with obsolete speeders. Rey and Chewbacca draw TIE fighters away from the Millennium Falcon, while Rose stops Finn from sacrificing himself, knowing that there are other options. The First Order penetrates the Resistance fortress using a siege cannon. Luke appears from the distance and walks over quietly to confront himself to the First Order, allowing the Resistance to escape. Furious, Kylo Ren orders every single fire on ""that man"", but despite their try, no fire harms him. He then engages Luke in a lightsaber duel, another exciting, edge of seat, master v apprentice battle; upon striking Luke, Kylo realises that Luke is not physically present, but projecting his image through the Force. Rey helps the remaining Resistance escape on the Falcon. An exhausted Luke dies peacefully on Ahch-To, to become one with the Force. Rey and Leia sense his death, and Leia tells Rey that the Resistance can rise again. At Canto Bight, the stablehands recount the story of Luke Skywalker; afterward, one of them moves a broom with the Force and gazes into space. The death of Luke was ultimately caused by the power of the Force, the most powerful Jedi trait, signalling that he died a Jedi, one of the greatest. The very well directed Episode 8 sees the insecurity of Kylo Ren and his ambitions to rule the Galaxy alone. Rey is still unsure why the Force drags her and Ren together. The episode captures passion, sacrifice and desire from the Resistance, standing up bravely against the First Order.",0.11384424156701384,0.47650657922935175

"It's far better than the retread 'The Force Awakens', but there's still something awkward about this latest trilogy in the Star Wars franchise. It's a bit of a 'kitchen sink', where writer and director Rian Johnson throws everything he can at us, whether it makes sense or not, and should have tightened it up. The plot requires contrived delays in time, such as when Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) go off to look for the codebreaker. There are aspects which feel derivative, such as the aging master, Luke Skywalker, disillusioned and bitter - which also has Star Wars fanatics feeling disillusioned and bitter.

"I went into the film with goodwill, wanting to like it, but I also had modest expectations given some of the varied opinions out there. The film's first 20 minutes or so seemed really by-the-numbers and was not grabbing me at all, starting off with a routine space battle with no story build-up to get the audience invested, Luke saying he doesn't want to train Rey, and Rylo Ken/Ben Solo getting talked down to by his master, the Supreme Leader. Ho hum. But when the film started to get more into character driven stories than plot driven ones, the film really takes off. That opening exposition did set up some great character driven storylines, the most welcome of which involves a new character, Rose Tico, a mechanic working for the resistance who's sister was killed during that opening space battle. Rose's story as a low level true believer in the resistance getting caught up with main players Finn and Poe Dameron is terrific and a great hook for audiences to enter into the Star Wars universe with a fangirl of these rebel heroes. The main storylines in the film involve the rebel fleet fleeing the New Order while low on fuel and unable to jump to light speed, Rey trying to get Luke to come back and help lead the resistance while also telepathically linking to Rylo Ken and trying to draw him to the light side of the force, and lastly a secret plan by Finn, Poe Dameron, and Rose to sneak aboard a Star Destroyer to save the retreating rebel fleet. While those all seem very plot driven, writer/director Rian Johnson makes these stories dependent upon character and that's why this entry into the new trilogy really works so well. The last of the three plot lines, about sneaking onto a Star Destroyer to exploit a design flaw, is a very played out plot device for a Star Wars film, but Johnson plays against audience expectations and makes it work. Johnson also plays against expectations with the commanding officer of the rebel fleet being played by Laura Dern. It's unexpected casting, and don't get me wrong, Dern is a terrific actress, but is not someone who I'd have pictured in a Captain Kirk/Captain Adama type of role, but she commands the screen with power and grace. This being unexpected for me may be my male centric/chauvinistic perspective, but I want to commend the filmmakers for prominently featuring women in heroic/action roles throughout the film. ""The Force Awakens"" did this some by making Rey the main character, but ""The Last Jedi"" noticeably had more women as fighter pilots, on the command bridge, and in other leadership roles. This made me realize how male dominated the original and prequel trilogy were. The other character point that Johnson gets credit for is his development of Rylo Ken/Ben Solo. Johnson and Adam Driver make the character's inner turmoil between whether to embrace the light or dark side of the force seem very real and honestly left me wondering which way he will go. In the prequel trilogy, we already knew Anakin was going to embrace the dark side, so there was no suspense there, and the original trilogy had Vader as an out-and-out black hat villain for the first two films with no hints of an inner struggle, so having the Vader figure of the new trilogy palpably struggling with what direction to go is compelling to watch. Daisy Ridley also gets a lot of credit for helping make Rylo Ken's struggle feel more human, but Ridley deserves recognition for the strength of her own character as well, with Rey holding her own with such an iconic of character as Luke Skywalker for much of the film. It's also worth noting Carrie Fisher's final film appearance as Leia was given additional weight by her recent passing in real life. There's also a surprising supporting role by Benicio Del Toro, who is terrific as always. I'm really hoping his character returns in the next film. SPOILER ALERT! Getting to see Luke and Leia reunite, even if it was ever so briefly, is a great little moment. The other spoiler worth noting is Yoda's appearance and how excited I was to have Yoda portrayed by a puppet once again and NOT computer generate imagery (along with again being voiced by the great Frank Oz). Overall, ""The Last Jedi"" elevated the new trilogy and allowed it to stand on it's own. ""The Force Awakens"" was the fanboy movie I was hoping to see with the prequel trilogy and made me excited about the Star Wars universe again.

I absolutely love the direction taken with Luke and the different characters who support him. Again Johnson doesn't only take the force to a new level but makes the arc of Luke even more interesting as it already was. Great interpretation and writing of Luke's character showing a deep knowledge of the material.
Really well paced but at times the pace slows down in bad way on a little adventure of the new character Rose but afterwards comes the best part of the movie.

First of all, before I can even say if I liked the plot of the new Star Wars saga movie, The Last Jedi, a plot which most Star Wars fans simply abhorred, I'd like to address this as simply a movie. Let's start withy the script. Bad. Very, very bad. There are no good conversations in this movie, there is no character development and perhaps the worst of it all, much of the storyline makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever. It was hard to care about Luke, Rey or Po because you learn nothing about them. So look throws the light saber over the cliff. This is so stupid because we all new look as a thoughtful, kind human being who loved Old Ben, Toda and even his father, so now after this young girl comes all the way across the galaxy to find him and learn about his RELIGION, he treats her like crap. No development on this wrong choice. Suddenly a hero from the last movie, PO, the greatest pilot in the galaxy, becomes a problem because he makes stupid and reckless choices.

I can re-watch this movie just to see this scene - the scene of punishment of lost and betrayed apprentice. This is still star wars, and keep in mind that it just cannot be the very same movie you used to enjoy in late 70s and 80s. I love original trilogy as well and I love the prequels, the new Star Wars is to be loved as well, and I came well prepared for some changes, bit it still the old Star Wars we need, this is the story to see, despite millions of people offer their own plot and characters development. And what the score - this music just runs through your veins and gives you real goosebumps. I believe Disney will develop Star Wars universe and also bring another stories from old republic era.

"For a movie that is considered the most anticipated movie of the year, STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI is leaving a lot of its viewers split down the middle. The same thing was said about THE FORCE AWAKENS when it came out. Say what you want about either of the movies, but just know that they are and always will be part of the Star Wars series. 
 In this case, we got entry number two in the new trilogy, episode eight, The Last Jedi. Picking up where we left off, the film ventures into Rey following her destiny alongside Luke Skywalker ( the LAST of the JEDI?) We also follow Leia Organa as she leads the Resistance against supreme leader Snoke and Kylo Ren's First Order. 
 Now, I'll admit that upon seeing The Force Awakens and seeing the trailer for The Last Jedi, that they would copy a lot from the original trilogy.Particularly, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. For example the AT-AT walkers make an appearance on a planet that's white, the main protagonist trains with an isolated jedi master, and other parts that are spoilers. So there may be similarities there, but does it work well? Yes, it does.
 What I love about this new trilogy is that it allows a new generation of movie goers to experience the same fun that people in the 70s-80s got to feel when they saw the original trilogy in theaters. Luckily, the writers managed to put in some new ideas. The last jedi does have its moments that make it a Star Wars film. Yes, there are space battles, there are lightsabers being used in battles, and a ""i have a bad feeling about this"" saying. Let's be thankful that there are no scenes where people sit around and talk about politics. 
 I believe that every moment in the movie mattered, even the entire canto bight sequence. They kept the ball rolling through out the film and really developed the new characters of the series. Talk about letting old things die.

Luke could have been at least mysterious or wouldn't say anything at the opening scene ,how come this is a star wars when there is no one who believes in force and no Jedi to train someone that believes it.
This was without a doubt huge amount of waste but also Snoke didn't have a chance to do anything I hoped he could be another palpatine but they ruined too.
 It was a nice final scene , seeing another skywalker saves the day.

"First, I wonder why all the haters' user reviews are on the top of the others?...Disturbing this is...and unfortunate! :-P ...Probably, they don't have anything else to do, than stay online and spread their unreasonable hate...Ugh...No matter what, the Metacritic is the highest of all Star Wars!! Woohoo!!! Anyways, I found the movie all in all AMAZING beyond any imagination. It surprised me positively from the first moment and I loved the fact that it was a much different Star Wars movie. More modern, more subversive with a wider aspect of all things. A Star Wars movie for the next generations. I myself am a Star Wars fan since I was 12-13 years old and now in my 40s I didn't mind the change. I welcomed it with great applause and interest. I was impressed particularly of the Force capabilities that were shown and weren't mentioned or appeared before in the Star Wars Saga. I understand that some people found that annoying, but I found it somewhat cathartic...Like all this time we were able to experience only a tiny sample of the Force, forcing us to a certain point of view of the Force....But now, yes! That's it! That's how ""maxi big the Force"" is!!! Thank you, Rian!! As Qui-Gonn and Yoda once said about the Force, ""life creates it, makes it grow...its energy surrounds us and bind us..."" Just because we didn't see so far any other Force capabilities, doesn't mean these are false or crazy. This film showed us something new, something fresh and also something funny -as all the Star Wars movies have a great deal of humorous scenes, this one also had it in a ""healthy"" amount -only funnier! Something that comes to mind regarding the negative reactions, are the words of Palpatine to Anakin in Episode III, that we should embrace the whole aspect of the Force, not only the dogmatic, narrow view of one part of it....Well, ok, that sounded a little bit dark-sided, but you got my point hopefully!... We have to keep our minds open and welcome the positive change and continuity of the Star Wars universe.

"I finally got around to seeing The Last Jedi several weeks after its release and somehow managed to avoid any spoilers. I had heard that it wasn't landing well with fans but I just brushed that off as people expecting too much or being dismissive of a direction the story was heading; after seeing this movie I can see why they were so upset.
The best part of the movie arguably happens in the opening scene. Scrolling texts, rebels desperately attempting an escape, dynamic space fights and a bit of humor. It makes you feel like the movie is picking up where it left off and the amount of casualties and character interactions makes you feel like this movie has weight, sadly it doesn't continue on this path. The space fight sets up a scenario where all characters except the main 6 or so are nothing but pawns, just nameless bodies waiting to be killed with no real consequences for their deaths other than a sort of ""whoops, lost a few more"". They handcuff every character to just kind of stand around and it makes the whole movie feel stale, and the fact that so many die just makes it seem like they never really mattered anyway. 
The stagnant Rebel vs Republic standoff aside the interactions of the main characters are equally dull. In a movie that set itself up to seem like there would finally be answers to log standing questions, fans got none. We finally get an answer to who are Rey's parents, apparently they're no one important and they reveal that bluntly and with no real weight behind it. For such a major driving force of the first movie it didn't seem to matter at all. Luke is sad because he failed but still seems to have learned nothing from his experiences. Snoke is very present, and shows off very little power, and is killed without much resistance or conflict with no answers about his origin or motivations, he never fights, he just gets killed and now hes done I suppose. Kylo Ren is the only redeemable character in the story, we get a half answer about when he destroyed the temple and ran away from Luke but even then it left more questions than answers, and his big ""turn"" where he interacts with Rey is rushed and unfleshed out because of the previously mentions rebel plot being dragged along. Finn's entire side story just seemed like they didn't know what to do with him. He had no real impact on anything in the story, he could've been left out entirely and the main plot would not have changed. The final battle was inconsequential and anti climactic.

"It can't be denied that the original STAR WARS trilogy is one of the most iconic cornerstones of filmmaking -- an ambitious mixing pot of space-blasting action, alien cultures, and mythological nuances that has captivated so many audiences for years. The namesake suffered something of a stall, however, with George Lucas' flawed prequel trilogy, which, with the exception of REVENGE OF THE SITH, couldn't live up to the reputation of the original trilogy. In a bizarre twist of fate, Disney of all companies purchased the rights to STAR WARS, beginning work on a new trilogy with other movies to come in the subsequent weeks. 2015's THE FORCE AWAKENS, handled by J.J. Abrams, while perhaps too much of a copycat of A NEW HOPE, was nonetheless breezy, flashy, and entertaining -- a great love-letter to the trilogy (with the exception of one character death).

This movie plays like a Star Wars fan fiction written by an author that did not love or really understand, the source material. These characteristics made it hard for me to enjoy what the movie did have to offer. In my opinion, this movie is a typical and somewhat competent work of its time.

My idea is that we see things here.. certain circumstances and characters that are going to be much greater in the future. They showed that in The Force Awakens that Kylo was much weaker than Rey. In this film they showed that they are now equal when the lightsaber was broken in half. So what do you think? I loved Kylo and Luke's tension, it made the story ten times more intriguing.

"Have no idea why in the heck there are any bad reviews here. This movie imo was great, epic in scope, and lays the groundwork for much more 'epicness' in the final film in this trilogy...What Luke does at the end was imo one of the greatest displays of Jedi power ever in ANY star wars movie...The way they explained how the force works and what it is goes along so well with todays current theories on energy etc so it made it so much more believable to me than anyother explanation (like episodes 1,2,3 lol that was dumb) I honestly cant think of anything that makes this movie deserve a bad rating or flack from fans. The CGI was great, acting great, plot was good (maybe not great but good enough to deserve higher ratings than wut many are giving it) and that ending...WOW imo! lol Cant get over that ending part with Luke lol..Amazing! 8/10..Not perfect, not 10 worthy, but def atleast 8 worthy",0.3525641025641026,0.658974358974359

At the same time, however, it felt pretty shoehorned in and did not feel completely coherent. On top of that, the film was muddled with a few plot holes and a few cringe worthy sequences (green milk fresh from the teet and the notorious ""Carrie Poppins"" scene.) The film did leave me interested to what could happen in the next film, had decent acting, amazing visual effects and action, an always beautiful score, a thought provoking and meditative ending and it was fairly watchable the first time around. However, at the end of the day it was really a one trick pony, good for one time to watch and then the thrill wears off.

"A good sequel but I must admit I preferred Episode VII, simply because it had the better and more exciting story. DOnt get me wrong this new installment of the legendary franchise is still a very good film but I thought the approach of Riann Johnson in regards of making it too comedic at time that it felt like a parody of its own was not always the right way to handle it. I know its good that it doesnt take itself too seriously but the problem is that in some parts it felt like a skit and in other parts it actually DID take itself very seriously so I did not really think the mix worked too well. But yeah that is basically the only beef I have with it. I missed more twists, a la ""Empire Strikes Back"" but I guess they may save those for the last part. I also wasnt sure about the fate of some characters they built up so well in the first part. But anyway, I don't want to get into too much detail as I don't want to spoil it (but to be honest there is not much too spoil). 
Acting wise it was fine. Mark Hamill did well and had some really good moments throughout the film. The way he played Luke Skywalker is very different to the way he did before and that was interesting. A great development and the film left him some room to even further develope it throughout. Daisy Ridley was all right, however some scenes were a bit exaggerated. Carrie Fisher was great, and not only because of the bittersweetness of her appearance but they really gave her something to do here, unlike in Episode VII. Adam Driver was possibly the best of the cast, still at times monotone but mysterious and very twisted. I liked it. He also expressed the dilemma of his character excellently. Oscar Isaac more and more developes into Han Solo. John Boyega was tolerable. I really don't like Domhnall Gleeson in that series. Horrible performance. 
Good new addition of Laura Dern who also had a great character. Benicio Del Toro was great, I just wished has role had more significant. 
There is another thing that bugged me, it relates too much to the old films like the scenarios repeat themselves, there is nothing original nothing shocking. The structure is the same like an never-ending story. J.J. Abrams film could come over that, I hope he can do it again.",0.24801894826484994,0.5876210583587633

"All Stars Wars movies get so much hype and deservedly so! Star Wars is one of the most iconic movie franchises ever created. As soon as the trailer for The Last Jedi came out, it exploded everywhere. The excitement just kept building and building, but this movie completely failed to live up to the hype. If I were to rank the Star Wars films, this one would be in the middle somewhere. It's definitely better than Episodes 1-2, but not even close to being as good as Episodes 4-7. It's about even with Episode 3. This movie has so many problems though... The plot and sub-plots are terrible, the jokes aren't funny (thanks Disney), and the characters have hardly any substance to them! 
The plot literally consists of The First Order ships trailing and shooting at The Resistance ships from a distance. While that is going on for 75% of the movie, pointless sub-plots are developing. The sub-plot with Finn and new character, Rose, has no ramifications on the rest of the story. It didn't play in at all and went on entirely too long. The sub-plot with Rey and Luke on the island is left unexplained and just takes up time. The majority of that portion of the movie consists of Rey trying to convince Luke to train her/come back to help The Resistance fight The First Order. It doesn't lead anywhere at all and many parts are left unexplained or unfinished. Don't even get me started on Snoke. His character is the most confusing to me. The directors/writers/whoever have done a terrible job explaining who Snoke is. He is apparently some incredibly powerful leader who can just obliterate anyone whenever he wants (I didn't know that until I read another review). He is never introduced or explained in any way though. He's just thrown in the thick of the story and is the leader behind the First Order and ends up being killed off by Kylo-Ren after just a few appearances ??? It's really confusing and a terrible move on the part of the writers. As I mentioned above, the jokes were really bad. That's easily attributed to Disney's cheesy, children's comedy used over the years. It's a PG-13 action film, and it's like they tried to appeal to the 12 year old and under crowd with the humor. Not very smart.
The new characters are just not thriving as the old characters did in the original movies either. Han Solo, Vader, Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and more are all stand outs in the Star Wars franchise. But the new characters, Rey, Finn, Poe, and others just don't seem to be fitting in as well. This film made the characters even more shallow. The characters are spread out in different locations in the galaxy for most of the movie. So a lot of jumping around went on in this movie to get each character some screen time. But it was only for little snippets at a time. It's like you get a little insight on each character for a few minutes in a scene that has no point to the main plot, and that's it. The only character I will say they did a great job with is Kylo-Ren. Adam Driver, who plays Kylo-Ren does an awesome job. He plays his character very well, and adds a lot of substance to the movie. Other than that, you don't see a whole lot about the characters. The whole figuring out who Rey's parents are is getting real old too. They just keep dragging that crap on. Come on now. Are we really suppose to believe that her parents are some trash people from and irrelevant town? They kept harping on that throughout this movie, and it's getting annoying. That's basically the sum of Rey in this movie. If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll obviously go see this movie. But be prepared. You're most likely to be disappointed and/or confused.
With all that being said, I will finish by saying a few positives. There are some unexpected turns in this movie. I was very surprised on many occasions, and it really added some excitement to the movie. Also, as mentioned above, Kylo-Ren is a great character and is executed very well by Adam Driver. Overall I give this movie a 5/10.",0.031124947150228063,0.487357399155152

"When Disney and Abrams restarted the Star Wars saga in 2015 with Force Awakens, they gave us a delicious, candy-like confection that gave us everything we loved about the space opera: adventure, earnestness, humor, and lots of space action. Now, with venerated filmmaker Johnson at the helm, Last Jedi is something decidedly-less immediately pleasing, though undoubtedly heartier. The nature of good-and-evil, the import of passing-time, the difficulties of truth. Sure, it's not quite revelatory, but it reaches for it...and is plenty of fun along the way.
There's a whole lot going on here. Rey is being trained by Luke, and that stuff is great. Leia and Poe are trying to evade the First Order while leading the rebellion towards a new base, and that stuff is (mostly) great. Finn and newcomer Rose team up with an awesomely enigmatic codebreaker on a first-world planet, and that stuff is hit-and-miss. Kylo Ren struggles with his finding his place in a universe stuck in the past, and that stuff is transcendently fantastic. The design is beautiful, the cinematography is sweeping, the humor is strong and the fight scenes are among the best yet. It's all bold and kinetic and flawed and jagged and fun. In other words, a Star Wars film.
Luckily, unlike the overstated claims that Force Awakens was just a nostalgic reboot, Last Jedi is very much its own beast, working in a mold while consistently finding ways to break it. Director Johnson has managed to walk into a money-making machine and put his personal imprint on it.

It was a collaborative effort between Disney, JJ abrams, Rian Johnson, and the thousands of people associated to make it the way it was. At very least it was interesting. To me it was genius. I knew it wasn't going to be the movie people wanted it to be when Luke tossed the light saber. People think that just because it wasn't the move they expected that must mean it's bad. It wasn't. It was a great film, and if you can't see past your own expectations then maybe you should stick to the prequels lest you encounter any change in your life.

"Second ""Star Wars Holiday Special"". Last jedi is a cartoon for small children. Colorfull parody of Empire Strikes Back.

Its hard to say if this is the worst star wars movie since ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" (its very similiar in structure and idea of making star wars comedy for children), because ""Phantom menace"" & ""Attack of clones"" were also very bad movies.

"First off, I'd like to say that I loved this movie. I saw it five times in theaters and each time I noticed something new. I loved that Poe called Hux, General Hugs, and that BB-8 stole the walker. This is the type of comedy that Star Wars needs. It needs to be funny, to keep the audience interested, but not too funny because then you have, well, Jar Jar Binks. This is my favorite Star Wars movie, and I agree with most of the bold choices they made. It did start to get old after four and five times but you can't only see this movie once. I think two or three is the golden amount for a Star Wars movie in theaters. A lot of people said that it didn't live up to expectations, but I had just as many expectations. At the time of this review, I have watched the official trailer (ya know, the one that starts with ""when I found you"") 703 times! This was an incredible movie, and it makes me excited for the future of Star Wars. I think Star Wars is in good hands and Disney will take it places.
 Enough with the overview. Now I'm going to talk about what I loved and what I'd rather them change. I, like many other Star Wars fans, loved anything that happened in Snoke's Throne Room. It was unexpected and very cool. I also liked the reveal of Rey's parents. It shows that Star Wars doesn't have to revolve around the Skywalkers. It shows that almost anyone can use the force. Even though, I think Crait was underused and the chase through space was overused, what did happen on Crait was cool and true to Star Wars spirit and the chase in space added urgency to the situation that makes a Star Wars movie that much better. I think Luke dying added to the story. It showed that it is time to pass the torch and stop pestering over the original movies I, and many others, watched all those years ago. I liked how they had him die peacefully watching twin suns after sacrificing himself to help the rebels escape just like Old Ben did in the Death Star many years before. But every movie has problems, so now here are the things I didn't like about this movie. Number 1 is Leia Poppins. Even though the score in this scene is awesome, the scene isn't as good. It proves everyone's point that main characters have a protection shield. It would have been more powerful and a lot better if it showed her floating there while playing the soft Leia theme and just crossed out the part where she twitches and floats back. Number 2 is Canto Bight. I have no problem with Canto Bight, in fact, I think it's pretty cool. If you're skeptical over Canto Bight, read the Canto Bight novel by John Jackson Miller, Mira Grant, Rae Carson, and Saladin Ahmed. It's really interesting! Anyway, the reason why I didn't like Canto Bight was because it felt forced and out of place. I think they should have reserved Canto Bight for Solo: A Star Wars Story which will come out in May. I think it fits better in Solo than it does in The Last Jedi, considering Han is an avid gambler and smuggler. It would be a cool easter egg, though, if Canto Bight was where Han won the Falcon. Number 3 is Finn. I don't mean the character, I like the character, I mean his ""death"". I think it would be better if that whole part was cut or Finn sacrifices himself. It is a really powerful moment when he goes in for it, but Rose saving him, again, is rally dumb and feels like a main character shield. Either he sacrifices himself or doesn't even try. It feels like the story team was sitting around a table and they couldn't agree, so they compromised and that compromise is really bad. ""It's not fighting what we hate, it's saving what we love."" Yuck! This is Star Wars (emphasis on the Wars), what do you think this is, The Space Between Us?
 Overall, though, I loved this movie and I personally cannot wait until it comes out on Blu-Ray and Digital.

I've gone over this more in my Force Awakens review, but I mentioned that before Star Wars was made, most science fiction films were scene as fun little B movies that, while having an audience, didn't have a lot of respect when compared to classics like Citizen Kane and Ben Hur.

Go back to 1977 when Mark Hamill was our teen hero as Luke Skywalker whose journey as teen to a Jedi is scripted in subsequent sequels as we grew up.Today as I watch the latest -'Star Wars the Last Jedi' film with my son in 2017 at age of 56 I almost feel what Luke must be feeling interacting with young Rye who is not at all blue blooded but a child almost sold off by less gifted parents.Still she shows the will power to face the brute dark forces and takes over the mantle of the Last Jedi.The film is a new revelation which will hopefully lead to new sequels as the old from my generations are wiped off or disappear giving the fight against the dark forces to gennext.

"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is a decently good feature. Acting is a plus, highlighted by an inspiring performance from Hamill and intriguing acts by the main leads. The central storyline is therefore quite pleasing. Great dialogue is present during various emotionally heavy scenes concerning these characters, enhancing the film's intensity and meaning. Unfortunately, the other subplots of the film are deeply unsatisfying. Character insights are highly poor and the introduction of new characters fall flat on various fronts. The themes attempted are utterly frustrating and cringeworthy. Ultimately, the entirety of what occurs apart from the main cast is highly questionable. Between the slowness of what happens to the ridiculousness that ensues, the conclusion to the subplot neither feels like a payoff or can redeem the poisoning plot holes created. The supporting cast simply was not written into the story well. Fortunately, the visual effects and sound are stunning throughout. The central plot saves the feature, presenting wonderfully choreographed combat scenes and intriguing newfound abilities. In particular, the resolution is epically awesome and at least leaves the feature on a satisfying note. Overall, this was an oddly disappointing, yet fulfilling film that had amazing pieces nearly set off by the poor writing that at times befalls it.",0.11340909090909093,0.5194588744588744

"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a direct continuation of Star Wars The Force Awakens, but with a difference, the direction and script were in charge of Rian Johnson who amused fans with a lot of fanservice but failed to deliver a grand sequel to the new trilogy. Usually the second film is the highlight in a trilogy, but in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, director and screenwriter Rian Johnson was unable to maintain the grandeur of the universe that was presented to us in The Force Awakens, leaving shallow characters that were presented to us in previous movie. The only ones that were well developed were Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), the others were not treated as in the previous film with depth having two layers with a background that made fans create theories. Starting with Rey and Kylo Ren, where Rey was reduced to a girl who can't do anything on her own, unlike the fearless girl who solved everything with her own hands, not forgetting that they summed up the character's past with just one line from the villain. Kylo Ren is a difficult character to deal with, and now with the outcome he had in The Last Jedi it only gets worse, we don't know if he's a villain or a future hero, we don't know if he's powerful or if he's just a spoiled brat. Adam Driver's lack of charisma on paper was masked by the character's grandeur and characterization, and that was deconstructed early in the film. Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) were also downplayed by side-quest assistants who are of no use at all, while the ""powerful"" Leader Supermo Snoke was just a CGI doll (very well done by the way) spoke only using sound words. A villain worthy of Star Wars who was left out without even telling us who he really was. All of these negative points are in the account of Rian Johnson who gave us a confused film, with many script holes, with a confused edition, and moments that border on Marvel Studios jokes, and as a Star Wars fan, this was not what I expected. What was shown during the release of the film was something different, more dense and serious, remembering that The Last Jedi shows the Rebel Alliance being decimated, with our hero Luke Skywalker needing to use force again to save the few that are left. But the film was not just that, it also featured scenes that touched those in the cinema, and full of fan services that pleased those who saw the session. This is very pleasing, since we are fans of Star Wars and we always want the best, I really expected much more from this continuation and thanks to the Force, director JJ Abrams returns to finish this trilogy that has everything to bring new fans and please longtime fans .",0.05600118835412953,0.46766191325014855

Thank George Lucas for creating a universe that is very hard to get right, and for personally demonstrate how horribly wrong it can all go when one strays too far from the winning formula of the original trilogy (by creating the lamentable prequel trilogy). Disney has struggled so far to tell a compelling new story while remaining on safe ground: episode VII captured the tone perfectly but felt like too much of a reboot in terms of plot, while Rogue One tried something new and got bogged down in a dour mood peppered with weird fan-service.

"The Last Jedi did not have to do much to be an improvement over ""the force awakens"" - it pretty much accomplished that goal when someone other than JJ Abrams wrote the script.
But still, the improvement is great, and in no small part this is due to the film's not-so-subtle criticism over its predecessor: For example, early on, Kylo Ren is chastised for being just a silly guy in a mask who got beaten by a girl who had never used a lightsaber, addressing (at least in part) one of the many ridiculous points of tFA. Then the film pokes fun at tFA's last scene (and some other plot points). But more importantly, it has 2-3 major twists that seem to be direct refutations of what Abrams wanted to do with the story - I mean, perhaps these were planned all along, but I somehow doubt that master-copycat JarJar Abrams intended to have Snoke die so quickly, easily and ingloriously. I doubt he intended for Ray to really be a nobody from nowhere. The latter is a really good choice, the former can be criticised to a degree (we learn next to nothing about who this extremely powerful Sith is, where he came from, etc), but it is a bold decision: it says enough with the master-apprentice Sith duos, we have seen more than our fair share of those.

"When I heard that Disney was taking over LucasFilm - the thought that crossed my mind was: How are they going to continue the canon (storyline) of the biggest franchise in American Cinematic History? I answered that question myself: In one word: INCREDIBLE! Not the word that comes to mind when you have been a Star Wars fan for almost nearly a century and a half. 
 You know there is a little big of the light and the dark side in every one, but when you really think about it - it is so surreal to really fathom at the thought that this could be the last great franchise in cinematic history. I would have to say that, without a shadow of a doubt, that no matter where we are or what we are doing, Star Wars will live in all of us until we meet our destiny. 
 The Last Jedi raises too many emotions to really even write about due to the fact that we lost someone extremely special to us. Carrie Fisher, was by far the greatest actress of the last few centuries and even decades. Her legacy and her name will never be forgotten even if and when Star Wars is no more. So I guess, this is more of a tribute than a movie review, because in so many words you can't even describe how this movie has moved and touched all of us. 
 I mean, come on, there is no way, that I could even begin to describe how The Last Jedi was, in so few words, incredible and amazing. But I know for a fact, that J.J. Abrams is going to do a hell of a job incorporating the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy and the new trilogy and tie everything together for Episode IX (9). 
 I have loved every minute of this franchise. To be quite honest, I was not a fan in the very beginning, but a good friend of mine got me hooked, and now I am hooked for life.",0.22726162726162727,0.4646617271617271
"I frequent IMDb, but I have yet to submit a review. This film however left me no choice but to exercise this feature. ",0.05,0.15
"When it opened in 1980, the Empire Strikes Back was not the universal success that we now think of it as. Audiences were mixed, accusing it of being both too different from Star Wars and too similar to it. It was said that the film was too serious, and ""machine-made"". Many bemoaned that Empire and its creative team had missed the entire point of the original film. The final reveal of Luke's parentage by Darth Vader was not unanimously well received either, as many rightly pointed out that it contradicted the facts laid out in the previous film. While George Lucas wrote and directed the original Star Wars, he neither directed nor wrote the Empire Strikes Back. Much like some of the negative responses to TLJ, many who weren't expecting what ESB brought made a big stink about how they ""missed George"". But Irvin Kirshner, Leigh Brackett, and Lawrence Kasdan made a far better film than Lucas could have done. In case there was any doubt about that, he drove that truth home with the comparatively juvenile and disappointing Return of the Jedi (which saw Lucas regain creative control). 
Some warmed up to Empire soon after its controversial premiere, while others needed to see ROTJ to fully appreciate Empire for what it was. In any case, it's now generally considered the indisputable classic of the Star Wars franchise, while its sequel is largely seen as a disappointment. What a difference time makes. 
Now here we are in 2017, and similar things are being said of The Last Jedi. Like Empire, TLJ is a more complex and challenging film than its predecessor. As such, it will take time for some fans to come around. And, like Empire before it, The Last Jedi bucks many of the expectations that the audience had for it. You can witness the seething rage of those dashed fantheories in many of the negative reviews for the film currently on the web. Few discuss the film itself. They tend to complain about things external to the film (politics, racism, Disney's business practices, the fact that the film didn't incorporate the reviewer's fanfiction, how much the reviewer hates Rian Johnson's previous films, etc.). But those initial reactions are primarily an artifact of the time we're in. The movie has only been out for a few weeks now. When the dust settles - when the trolls get bored and go to complain about how Black Panther has too many non-white actors, and the fans come to grips with the curveballs that the film throws - The Last Jedi will be remembered as one of the great Star Wars films. 
The Last Jedi, like Empire, pushes the franchise into new territory. Some were angry about Rogue One for this or that reason, but it was mostly uncontroversial popcorn fare. We already knew that story. Similarly, we already knew where things would end up in the prequels. This is the first new territory for a Star Wars film since Return of the Jedi. For once, we don't already know what happens to these characters. As such, many of the answers in the film will not be the ones people were imagining. But this is a film that will be remembered fondly for what it has done, rather than what is hasn't done (which has dominated much of the negative response so far). The things that it didn't do will fade, as always happens with sequels like this one. People no longer complain about the stuff that Empire didn't do (except Joss Whedon, who can't stop whining about the ending). When Empire was all potential, it could have been anything. Now that potential is gone, replaced with something real. Similarly, The Last Jedi must overcome not just the expectations of following up TFA, but of following the entire Star Wars saga. That's a whole lot of potential. It has 40 years of Star Wars nostalgia to reckon with, while also trying to chart new ground (something TFA didn't do much of, as it was mostly a nostalgia trip). That Rian Johnson manages to do that so well is not just impressive, but inspiring. 
As a lifelong Star Wars fan who remembers when the prequels hit the theaters, The Last Jedi is a treasure. It tells a new story that is familiar without being rote or tedious, and weaves characters both new and old throughout. The ingredients are recognizable, and the film is true to its universe, but they are rearranged in ways that keep things exciting. Every time TLJ looks like it's about to give us a carbon-copy of a scene from the original trilogy, it does something far more interesting instead. Luke Skywalker may be older and scruffier than you remember, but that's what 40 years will do to you - especially if you spend many of those years as a hermit on an uncharted planet. And he does right by his legend, even if it doesn't happen in the way some expected. Rian Johnson even does the impossible, making Kylo Ren (a.k.a. Ben Solo) into a sympathetic character while simultaneously forcing the audience to take him more seriously than ever before. And for the first time since the original trilogy, the struggle between Light and Dark actually seems like a real struggle, and not just a prolonged lesson in good and evil based on lines arbitrarily drawn in the sand. The failure to make Anakin's fall believable was the cardinal sin George Lucas committed in the prequel trilogy. There is more believable tension and inner conflict in Rey and Kylo in this film than Anakin had in all three prequels combined. And it makes this story far more compelling for it. 
This film will not give you everything that you expect. But if you're open to it, it will give you what you need. And in time, this film will stand alongside Empire as a science fiction classic.",0.12270351599619893,0.5026237989652623

"Star Wars Episode VIII is a very different film for the star wars franchise. It ditches some of the classic themes of good vs evil to tell a different story. The film once again focuses on Rey who wants to convince the older Luke Skywalker to join Leia and the Resistance, to fight the evil First Order and it's devilishly evil leader Snoke. At the same time, Leia and the rest of the Resistance, including Poe Dameron go through their own troubles while trying to flee from the First Order. The entire cast from Star Wars: The Force Awakens returns, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac and Carrie Fisher in her final film role. Mark Hamill has to singled out, his performance as the legendary Luke Skywalker is well, legendary. Luke is broken and fragile in this film. He has a very little sense for hope, something that angered many fans of the character. I think that this was a very brave move that turned many ideas about the franchise on its head. Daisy Ridley is also very good at showing the youth within her character. She is filled with hope and believes that with Luke's help they can win the fight against the First Order. Rey is very naive, something that a Mary Sue really isn't. What really surprised me about The Force Awakens was the treatment of Kylo Ren. This is continued in The Last Jedi. Kylo is treated like a main character, who has his flaws but who doesn't really come across as this evil. Kylo simply is a human being who made a decision, the line between good and evil seems to fade away. Carrie Fisher who thankfully received a much larger role in this film than she did in The Force Awakens, enlightens the screen with hope, beauty and joy. She simply gives the best performance of her entire career. Same thing can be said about Hamill. This film isn't entirely flawless. Without spoiling anything, the side plot involving Finn and the new character of Rose felt stretched out and almost pointless. The arc for Finn seems rehashed from The Force Awakens, which is unfortunate as this arc could've easily be given to his partner. Kelly Marie Tran's performance is good, however her character feels rushed. Same thing can be said about Vice Admiral Holdo, played by Laura Dern. Dern is a terrific actress, who is good in the film and the lesson she teaches is important however the way her character was written seemed a bit weak. So overall I really loved The Last Jedi. It did feel 30 minutes too long with the Finn and Rose story. However everything else involving Rey, Luke, Kylo and Poe was really interesting and it expanded the Star Wars lore. I think Star Wars fans need to let this film sink in more. After all, episode V was divisive for its originality however that is now seen as the best film in the series.",0.1710914918414918,0.5772567432567431

"So I had to to see this twice to fully appreciate anything about it. 
When I first saw it on opening night in 3D (NOTE: don't bother with the 3D). I thought it was weak. Just like with The Force Awakens the hype is not lived up to. It's not great it's just good and I'm expecting it to be great. It starts off OK, but then the second act is too long and scattered. Your expecting Empire Strikes Back, because we know it's the second in the new trilogy. It tries to be episode five without trying to be episode five, and in the process, too many stories are developing at once (and it's too much). We need to concentrate on ex-storm trooper finn's buffoonery, as his attempts to run away like a coward from the first order leads him on a mission with a new character, Rose to a part of the Star Wars universe we don't see that much, the land of the rich and the powerful. While Poe and Leia Organa are having conflict on how to handle the first order when the rebels are out matched by a first order destroyer. Meanwhile we also have to focus on Rey trying to become a Jedi, by a Luke Skywalker who seems uninterested in the idea all together (Now I see what Mark Hamill is talking about how he did not like what they did to Luke, it was not the guy I was expecting at all). To top it off, how Kylo Ren is integrated into the Last Jedi part of the movie so much it makes it a story on it's own to have to concentrate on. Then the last part of the movie reminds me of Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King so much, that even though it's a great part of the movie , I could not wait till it was over.
The second time I saw it, I did like it...Slightly better. The Disney version of Star Wars is a little too humorous, and that humor was annoying the first time I saw it, but more amusing the second time. Yet still, the humor fells like it was inserted into the film (possibly to insure a two billion dollar net like VII by appealing to international fans). You could have easily taken a lot of it out and still made a good movie that was not as long. This was a problem for the movie. We know it's not the end, we know we have another movie that will technically end the Disney Trilogy. Yet whenever you felt that it was time for the credits to roll the film kept going. It was like it was trying to over compensate for the lackluster ending in the greatest film of the Star Wars franchise, by having dozens of them.
That's my long (unending) opinion. It's good, but it's not great. I don't want to see it a billion times , I'm happy to see it twice. I'm sure this will not stop anyone from going to see it, It's just a warning to keep your expectations down, and hope it will seem better than I'm making it out to be. So I'll just end this by saying, so far, Rogue One was the best of the Disney era star wars films.",0.2457679473304473,0.4918786075036075

In this Last Jedi movie, I can feel the sense of perfection of sci fi movie by the sci fi director legend, JJ Abrams. I follow Star Wars since my childhood and also watched his other movies and series such as Star Trek and Fringe, so for me the Last Jedi is just perfect. The effect, sound, story plot, characters, ending, etc, there is no small mistake that I can found, nor I can criticize. Thank you JJ Abrams for making this Last Jedi the best Star Wars movie in my mature age that I can still feel of being Star Wars movie again and again. I can not imagine when Star Wars is not longer directed by JJ Abrams, it is like American history without Abraham Lincoln or World War II history without Adolf Hitler. Love this movie!!

"Every major scene is so poorly written and loaded with plot holes - did the writers all work independently of each other? Did anyone bother to check continuity? Luke says: ""I wasn't afraid of this power then... I am now."" Except we see in a flashback sequence he tried to kill Kylo out of his fear for his power. This is just a minor plot hole compared to the others. Even the technology used in this movie seems dumb. Missiles in zero-gravity space that have a decided ballistic arc. Spaceships with bomb-bay doors dropping bombs like WWII. People and ships flying through shields like they're not there - until the shields are there as a plot device. Opening a door into the vacuum of space? Why not. Rebels dig into trenches on their last holdout planet - to fight off a fleet of spaceships. Enemy decides not to use its fleet of spaceships to fight them and instead gets down on the ground to fight them hand-to-hand. Hux, the enemy commander, withdraws his Tie fighters that were literally on the verge of obliterating the Rebel cruiser - why? ""We can't cover your fighters from here..."" It just goes on and on.

"As a lifelong fan of the saga, halfway through TLD after flirting with disappointment in the movie I decided to stop comparing it to the originals or waiting for a classic moment on par with say, the Death Star attack in A New hope. There is so much to enjoy about this new trilogy; the whole franchise hinged on the casting of Rey and in this movie (as with the last hour if FA) she comes to life. In fact the whole suite of new characters all hit home for me aside from possibly general Hux who feels a tad one note. Kylo Wren must surely be one of the best characters in the entire saga. The way the move keeps you guessing throughout which side he will choose is a masterstroke. Whilst there is undoubtedly flaws (certain scenes/characters feel completely out if place in the SW universe, a questionable comedy balance) the final hour is pure Star Wars heaven. As for our heroines, I'm struggling to understand the fan criticism of Luke's character developments, it feels like were seeing the result of 40 years of growth and I for one thought this was the most rounded version of Luke we've seen. Leia is treated with the respect you'd expect and Chewbacca chews plenty of scenes up. I understand certain criticisms from SW fanatics but I for one am happy to go with this new version of our galaxy far far away and cant wait to wee where the journey ends.

His unpredictable plot and storyline elevated this story to the level of one of the greats, almost comparable to the caliber of Empire and Rogue. 
Seeing Luke once again in lightsaber battle was mesmerizing. The humour of Chewie and what I've been calling the gophers on the Falcon was actually humorous, like the dialogue of the droid K2 in Rogue One, removing the cheese from the humour of the earliest droids and the silliness of the non-humour of Jar-Jar. 
I would have scored this a 10, but I didn't find there was a scene that caused my adrenaline to race, such as in The Force Awakens, when Rei, engaged in battle with Kylo, becomes calm, embraces the Force, and becomes the stronger of the two combatants. 
One other element of script writing and realization by Rian Johnson that is worthy of mentioning is in relation to his ability to create flashbacks to earlier films in the mind of the viewer.

You can actually watch TFA and TLJ as a 5-hour film and I'm not complaining about that!",0.20325630252100843,0.3455182072829131

"I went and saw this today. I read reviews and they were not stellar so I went to see for myself which is the ultimate individual test. Hmmm. The magic is definitely lacking both Disney and Star Wars magic that is. However the viewer is in need of magic-wanting badly. What happened here? The characters are not interesting, the tired plot is the same and with all this technology people still fight with hand guns? Even jumping to light speed is old and boring. There were so many we are running out of time scenarios that one wonders why there is no time management? What really woke me up is two scenes where they show the cockpit of a fighter with toggle switches that go click? When Luke Skywalker the hero of all the old-time Lucas movies finally comes on screen I was expecting some really nice mastering of the Force that even puts Yoda to shame. But alas, the Force appears to be tired, lacks motivation and even when they wish each other the famous phrase ""may the force be with you"" after watching Luke I wonder what good is this to wish for? We need someone with vision to step up and really use the force that we all know and love and grew up with. To the credit of the film, it will bring in 1 billion or more and set-up Star Wars themes at the Disney Parks but for how long?

"It's in the title and emblazoned all over the trailers; Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi master, declaring the need to end the Jedi order and bring balance to the Force. And for much of the film it looks as if it will keep this promise to explore the darker, twisted complexities of both light and dark side, and finally deliver a conflict that isn't merely the next generation of different coloured lightsabers clashing. That was one of the main criticisms of Abrams' revival, that we had seen it all before (and better). The Last Jedi barely allows any time to muse on the poignancies in the long gaze between the weathered face of Luke and his daughter (or so fans pleaded and speculated). Unceremoniously, he tosses the ancient weapon over his shoulder as if he was throwing out the trash. Immediately Rian Johnson signals a changing of the guard - there is to be no Obi Wan mentoring here, no Karate Kid style montages. Luke sees a deep pit of darkness within Rey, and for once it seems more than just vague menace and funny helmets. ",0.008771929824561405,0.4429824561403509

I am writing the review for Star Wars The Last Jedi out of respect for the late Carrie Fisher who tragically passed away due to a heart attack on 27 December 2016. Her legacy will forever be immortalized in this film. I also want to say that I'm a big fan of Mark Hamill who plays the iconic character Luke Skywalker of the Star Wars franchise. This marks his fifth appearance following Star Wars The Force Awakens(2015). I respect him very much. He was my childhood hero - and still is.

"I have to say in the words of Yoda! (Yes I was surprised to see the wise little jedi master) ""It is good to see you Luke Skywalker"" and I hope we will see him again in part three, please because we lost Mrs. Fisher whom we will always miss, so please let him be in a significant part of the film. There was a part where Kylo Ren is so convinced that we must let go of the past (yet I am still waiting the Return of Han Solo in part 3 do not disappoint us, did I mention that Mrs. Fisher passed away and that we will always miss her and that there is an ache that can't be filled in her absence.) But I have to give you a snippet from this review : A Lesson in Ageless Thinking From James Bond ""Age is no guarantee of efficiency,"" the quartermaster says. ""And youth is no guarantee of innovation,"" Bond replies. Quite true. Please be careful that you don't disrespect the elders in your midst while seeking to carve a name for yourselves. Whatever you do to the seniors amongst us you do to yourself and later when your own handiwork returns to the hands of the masters seeking the same fate for you that you handed out in your youth. It was also George Lukas in an interview (I cant remember which one) one time whom mentioned the old saying ""old sins cast long shadows"", I think the best way is to respect all life, all things as Jedi Master Skywalker tells Rey on the first of three lessons he gives her and I add to forgive and forget, seek to heal old wounds with the balm of kindness, gentleness, good will and honest diplomacy. This does not mean that evil will not raise its ugly head, as Skywalker said there will be evil it may be here to stay for now but it doesn't have to be here forever, cruelty, hate, war, violence, can go away and we can find the way together, hand in hand as Rey tries later with Kylo Ren who refuses in his quest to destroy everything and start anew which we can't do, you destroy the good with the bad if you do that and we cannot do this as Rose Tico (a rebel fighter) tells Finn's character ""we fight for what we love"", which hit me like thunder when she acts out of love for him in a special scene which should bring a tear to your eye or atleast leave you with a lump in your throat. Moving away from the philosophical, I have to say that I wanted more at the end, that I was at first dissappointed with Skywalkers behavior at first but then realized that yes after so many years of fighting it takes it's toll on anyone but I need to see him again in part 3 triumphant in every way as he was when the first films came out because it does a heart and soul good to see him one in the force, one with the force! Lastly I would have like to see a more exciting sword fight, like the kind in Phantom Menace with Obi-wan and Qui-Gon vs. Darth Maul which is one of the greatest fight choreography I have ever seen (along with the fight scenes in Ipman part 1 which are incredible). Also if this movie is some 20 years later shouldn't the technology be more advanced, the space ship that Laura Dern's character (was great although too rigid, but good to see you back laura) is in towards the end seems advanced but other technology seems the same, for the next and future films and yes there should be a follow up to Rey's character she is just exciting as a jedi, her youth and please her purity must remain intact as the years pass to light and gui de the rest through the darkness that surrounds the jedi universe and I am excited to see new Jedi and hopefully alien ones like Asokah Tano from the animated clone wars. Hopefully Star Trek (the competitor) will not go Rated R but remain PG-13 but follow many of the same advice I gave above especially with the elders, while enhancing the story and action. I would like to see William Shatner make a significant Cameo alongside with John Luke Piccard (yes Kirk LIVES! As in the self written answer to his untimely death in the time traveling storyline, hey he could appear before that story line, just have him and the rest of the surviving cast appear to pay them tribute and satisfy age old fans and show respect), p.s. Chris Pine is great as the young Kirk, he has grown into the role and is very charismatic. I would love to see some new droids and more aliens and alien creatures a jungle planet would be awesome to see and a great back drop for a great battle scene as intense as you can make it with hundreds of resistance/ emperial fighters making their stand. By the way the 3D Effect continue to disappoint because although there is depth perception in some scenes, the whole idea is that the scenes need to POP-OUT at you and they don't. Come on guys get this done to really give us a real experience like no other, during some of the regal cinema promos we get the regal cinemas logo POP right out to us in TRUE 3D but that's it, can you guys get this happening, I mean we're paying a bunch of money to go see it in Imax 3D just for this (once again yes the depth perception is well done).",0.22572070786356502,0.524262642119785

"Let me be frank, I ran for A New Hope and Empire once I was done watching this over-inflated film. BUT, I can't help but feel it was attempting to tread on new territory and build on what was already established. Unfortunately, it carries the burden of a 7 movies before it, so a LOT of comparisons will be drawn to it. This is very much like Empire. She goes to train with a reluctant Jedi master as her friends are fighting to stay ahead of impending doom. We even get Lando's doppleganger in Benicio Del Toro. If you ever wanted to get a sense of Lando and Han's relationship...this seems to be an echo of what may have transpired.
I don't blame Star Wars fans for blasting this. The jokes are pretty much parody of itself. The characters do dumb stuff. And lead characters are separated. My guess...to introduce more people into the new universe. Why am I giving it a favorable review?
It's so well made. Much like the Spielberg/Lucas teaming, you can tell Rian Johnson makes...films. Rogue One seemed to be movie by committee. Though I don't think Johnson has the pixie dust buoyant touch of JJ Abrams, I can tell he is adding much more academia to future episodes. So this is more about the hope of better things coming up rather than what I've seen. Take that for what it's worth. As a film, there are heartbreaking moments that I won't get into. But it tugs at your memories in a good way. You sense Han Solo's presence, but...it seems so long ago. And how they handle Luke and Leia made me misty for the ol' days. Forget the underlying political junk of this era if you can. To me when we age out, it's always a sense of moving forward.",0.1885606060606061,0.4360353535353535

Even though that this is the longest of the Star Wars movies, I still think that this one comes out on top. The cast is terrific. I love those little porgs on Luke's hidden island. And this one has a great backstory for Rey as if she wants to find out a secret about her parents. The visuals are top notch with non-stop action. And yes of course, more of BB-8.

"It is important to preface this review by saying while I am a Star Wars fan, I'm a film fan first. The sheer negativity and hatred I have seen arise from this film was enough for me to type out a review on this site, and I rarely ever do that. The Last Jedi was a very good film and an even better Star Wars film. Yes, I can feel your anger, strike me down with your lightsaber. But after two viewings, I can definitively say that this movie was all that I wanted and more, even with notable flaws. 
Luke Skywalker's character arc:
Many people when flocking to hate this film, bring up how Rian Johnson destroys what made Luke Skywalker so compelling in the Original trilogy. He, even for a brief moment, plans to kill Ben Solo when looking into his mind, chucks Anakin's lightsaber, after Rey hands him it, and wants to the Jedi to end, seemingly going against his character. 
Well on the first example let's look into Luke contemplating killing his nephew. In the Original trilogy, Luke throws aside his lightsaber when being forced (no pun intended) to kill his father. This is a moment people continuously bring up to discredit this film's depiction. But let's go back to that original scene. Luke, hiding in the shadows, hears Vader say, ""If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she (Leia) will"". At this moment Luke lashes at Vader, cutting off his arm, and putting his saber towards his father's neck. Had the Emperor not have come down his throne to taunt Luke, it would seem likely Luke would have killed his father. In Luke's character, he doesn't want the dark side to manifest in his friends and family anymore than it already has. Now let's look at the Last Jedi scene. Luke, as he mentions in narration had looked into Ben's mind for months to see his alignment, he saw darkness but tried to brush it off. With his dark dreams continuing, Luke knew the dark side had already taken effect on him, much like his father. In that moment, Luke, making the same hasty decision as he did in Return of the Jedi, ignited his lightsaber to put an end to the darkness, but he corrected himself in the same way as well. So in other words, it fits the character.
Secondly, Luke throwing aside his father's lightsaber, was an effective way to communicate to the audience that Luke is done being a Jedi, it's a visual and even comic way to explain where he is in his life. Which leads me to the third problem people have with Luke, and that is his belief that the Jedi must end. In the originals, until the very end of Return of the Jedi, Luke was never a true Jedi. Most of them train from young ages, to even full on adulthood. Luke only had a year or so training from Yoda. He was just a boy, who never knew the full ways of the Jedi. After Yoda's death, the only means of his knowledge was learning from the sacred texts, not from a master (unless the force ghosts made regular appearances). This is a pivotal device in Luke's arc, as he is basing his entire belief system on old, non-page turning, books. This as well as the recent tragedy of Kylo Ren, was enough to push him into this way of thinking. He single-handedly destroyed his sister's family, and brought destruction, to the galaxy, it's no surprise he'd want to shut himself out. It isn't until Yoda returns (It's implied he hasn't returned to Luke in a while), who burns down the tree containing the texts, telling Luke that the Jedi are meant to evolve beyond the old Knights. He also tells him that his failure, is part of life, and to teach people how to go beyond that. Not being an all powerful Jedi, but telling others to move past their failures, by being a symbol of hope for the rebellion. Which is what Luke does in his last scene.",0.07789617486338797,0.4430096679277007
"My main problems with the film are that C-3po, R2-D2 and Chewbacca are being left out constantly throughout the film. They're the characters we want the most! BB8 might be a great addition but if he was actually working with R2-D2 on the missions then he'd be even better. C-3Po got a satisfactory role in the film and yes he did get one odd scene where Poe, who stole his role, told him shut up. R2-D2 didn't even get out the millennium falcon. He and Chewbacca were literally the only two characters who you knew were gonna survive because they stayed in the plain and did nothing. When we see our three heroes return, they need to be the main characters, not Poe Dameron. At least the ending hints that they may do something but it looks doubtful.

"This is a different movies, by far passes everyone other Star Wars movie before except of course for Empire. Yes this is a different Star Wars movie. ""Things are not going to go the way you think"" Many of the reviewers on the site are salty that their theories didn't come true, and that Luke was a hermit to begin with and not a Grand Master Jedi that the Expanded Universe originally wrote him as. Although, yes he is that, but that comes before this movie. Before the sequels (Although the flashbacks do help show that) Luke is now ashamed for what happened to Kylo, he feels responsible, and hurt. He feels like he let down Leia and everyone else. He has taken full responsibility for it all, he has gone to the island of the first jedi temple to simply get out of the way and die. But that is until Rey find him, at first yes he is unwilling to teach he, but then he agrees, now I cannot wait to see him return in Episode 9 as a force ghost and see Rey take over, who is the true last jedi, and teach a new generation of Jedi. She has the books, Lukes saber, and she is ready to take the screen and fulfill her destiny. Yes at first glance Snoke is a bit of a waste. Most people salty that he wasn't Bane or the Emperor, but it doesn't really matter who he is, or if he comes back or who he was. Kylo Red has overpowered his master, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, but Snoke was arrogant, and didn't count on Kylo betraying him. Adam Driver did a fantastic job at portraying this. You think he will turn and help Rey, but he tricks her, and try to turn her. All I can say is this film was fantastic.

"After reading a lot of bad reviews and media about the PC element to the film I actually didn't bother watching it until recently. I was really surprised how good it was. I literally felt like an 8 year old again durring some of the scenes. I did notice what felt like a mostly female cast, its hard not to, but even the stereotypical useless General was a women, and the Black Male was made to look like a coward and stupid, so all in all it wasn't politically correct in the typical sense it was actually really well done and didn't look to promote any particular group, in-fact it was open season on all of them, and although noticeable did not impede on the story, but it is enough to make it the topic of what a lot of people talk about after watching it. I think the story line is very clever and really makes you wonder which way the story is going to go. Some people have written that the story is direction less, but I think they are just accustomed to watching movies where the storyline is obvious and easily anticipated, this movie is very difficult to predict. There is nothing shocking about any of it and in the end it makes perfect sense. There are a few bits that are disappointing where you want the awesomeness of the force and Luke to save the day - when actually its just a mind trick, seriously if they had given the audience what it really would have like to see on this then people would have been out their seats cheering in the audience, how they resisted to do it that way is an absolute mystery and shows some restraint, but I guess they wanted something unpredictable and nothing that could be cheesy . The special effects were also spot on.

Where were the scenes with Luke we saw nothing of him in the movie only some rubbish scenes of him Mark Hamil is an excellent actor this is not his fault its Disneys and Ryan Johnson and Kathleen Kenedy they have no idea what star wars is really about. You kill off the one character that everyone was waiting to see for sooooo sooo long you ruined star wars for all of us fans we are heart broken and upset star wars is finished and done you guys have destroyed classics and the magic of it. Many scenes felt like it was from Harry potter like Rey standing in front of that stupid mirror and clicking her fingers what kind of rubbish is that ? And when she is sitting on the rock and feeling the force the grass growing and all that was so stupid and felt like an earth movie. The only character that was excellent was Kylo Ren played by Adam Driver he was amazing and the only scenes that were good were with him and rey i wanted to see more of them and them actually ending up together in a relationship. Where was Anakin and obi wan as the force ghosts ? how can you just put yoda and not them? Anakin is his father hayden christensen should have been a force ghost, Disney you have made a mess im so dissapointed the only person who is good at this is George Lucas the father of Star wars you will never make movies like him. It was not a dark movie at all too much humour in it.

The main problem was Rian was extremely cautious in his main themes and tried to be ambitious in the ancillary parts, but this created a disconnect making the side quests and extra characters seem pointless and underwritten.
The whole script was quite weak, but that's never been Star Wars movies' strongest points in fairness. The whole movie did need tightening up though, the whole middle section was baggy and unmemorable.
In contrast a movie like Rogue One was safe at the edges but ambitious in it's main theme. The Force Awakens was safe in most ways but introduced several interesting characters. Both these movies were superior to TLJ in my opinion.",0.15739999999999998,0.4602666666666667

"I thought it was average. After the travesty that was the prequel trilogy, everyone clamoured for "" more Star Wars "" and that was exactly what Abrams gave us, down to a virtually cloned episode 4, but that was what was being called for. Thankfully, this was not another Empire, much as I like that movie. This was well thought out and well executed, with an ensemble cast who, for the most part, can actually act out good dialogue. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and this , together with rogue one, is making the prequel trilogy a distant memory, thank goodness !! People can say what they like about Disney, but they DO know how to employ people who can actually write a coherent script.",0.22401620370370368,0.3907407407407408
"I can't believe all of the backlash for this movie on this site. I thought this was the one of the best Star Wars movies, if not, ""the best"". The acting was superb and the movie aesthetics were incredible. The plot, along with all of the sub-plots, made the climax and the ending of this movie epic! And sot since Empire Strikes and Return of the Jedi have we seen a Star Wars movie with some great and intense emotions in it. Finally, we have Star Wars actors that can produce real tears in ""convincing"" emotional scenes. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are great actors that portray their characters beautifully with deep and convincing emotions. This saga really centers on them two and I think it is fantastic. Their scenes together are some of the best in all of Star Wars, and that climatic sequence towards the end in Snoke's chambers was amazing - never before has that happened in Star Wars before, making it just unbelievable. And how the movie ended with Luke was fantastic as well. **SPOILERS AHEAD** Luke projected himself on a remote planet (Crait, which by the way is the best planet ever created in Star Wars) to confront the Kylo Ren because he was doing what Yoda taught him in Empire Strikes Back, and that is ""a Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack."" I'd say Luke did that against Kylo Ren better than any Jedi in all of Star Wars! The only other Jedi that ever came close to fighting the enemy in that fashion was when old Ben Kenobi fought Vader in a New Hope...and he became one with the force after too! You also have Rose saying to Finn a few sequences before the Luke and Kylo scene that ""we will win by not fighting with hate but saving with love"". Luke didn't fight Ben Solo with hate (at all actually), so maybe that is Luke's first step in trying to save Ben's soul...maybe Luke's Force Ghost connects with Ben Solo on a spiritual level in Episode 9 to help turn him back to the Light Side? Episode 8 was a great second act in what has been a great new Star Wars trilogy so far. Episode 9 is shaping up to be the most epic Star Wars yet with everything dependent on what happens between Rey and Ben Solo! How someone can watch The Last Jedi, and not ""like it"", is mind boggling. Even if die hard Star Wars fans don't like Luke's character and/or how the Force was used, the film still deserves at least a 3 out of 5 stars for great acting, movie aesthetics, character development, creativity, intriguing story, and fantastic emotional and action sequences!",0.283160552897395,0.5396331738437
"Having just come from the theatre, the one thing I think tarnishes this film most is the product placement.

"Went to see Star Wars The Last Jedi, I always get sucked in and end up regretting. This one is no exception to that rule. In the words of the immortal Princess Leia, the spark is gone although the budget is still more than handsome and the cash registers are singing happy returns. We know what that means, another sequel to the sequel or to the revamped series after the original and the prequel. It's a sure fire money maker so why bite the hands that feeds you, certainly not George Lucas.
There is one word which kind of sums it all up for me: debris. Lots and lots of debris, especially in 3D it's coming right at you that plus three strands of a story which do not coalesce into a satisfying whole.
One theme endlessly repeated: the light and the dark and who will conquer but meanwhile let's all enjoy the neverending war. Apparently there were cameos of people I missed Lupita N'yongo, Gwendoline Christie plus a wasted Benicio del Toro, an OK. Laura Dern looking suitably gungho and severe in an appropriate outfit.
Still there was something bittersweet knowing that Carrie Fisher's bright light had dimmed but she will be remembered forever here even if the movie itself was a thorough disappointment. Maybe I'm just not a Star Wars fan or I've simply outgrown it. In the end I found it overly long and boring. Once they start shooting each other out of the sky it's hard to tell who the friends and foes are and frankly my dear I don't really give a damn. Reviews have been mostly positive but with all the hype surrounding the release and the hush hush scenario it's not all that surprising. I did enjoy Adam Driver's performance, definitely can hold the screen and one's gaze. His Modigliani face is hard to look away from. My grade: C+",0.1813574520717378,0.5835322613894043
"Impressive,most impressive.After 37 years(The Empire Strikes Back) Star Wars is back.Star Wars:The Last Jedi is a nearly perfect film full of jaw-dropping action scenes,stunning visuals and huge twists and turns.
 The film is awesomely directed by Rian Johnson,who achieves to depict his own vision of this beloved universe.The action scenes never miss a bit due to his directing.The film's plot is really effective. lot of things happen that even the hugest Star Wars fan couldn't think of.This movie expands the Star Wars universe and adds new ideas to it in an original, fascinating way.The risky direction that the film takes make it a pure delight.
 The performances were really good.Mark Hamill was better than ever,Adam Driver was excellent and generally the whole cast did a great job.The relasinonship between Ray and Kylo is well-developed and although some people
found Fin's and Rose's adventure boring or insignificant,but I found it fine.
 The third act of the film one of the best moments in Star Wars history.Character's collide,the screen bursts with breath-taking scenes and a lot of questions are answered.
 The only flaw was the humor.Despite the fact that I laughed a lot,I have to admit that a lot of the jokes were presented in a way that looked like the film was making fun of itself.But this,in my opinion,is a flaw of minimum importance.
 All in all, Star Wars :The Last Jedi is amazing.It's a film to remember.A film which proves that Star Wars is and will always be a part of our history.But,even if it was bad or a failure,It wouldn't worry me at all.Because,as an old master once said:""Failure the greatest lesson is"".",0.3139069264069264,0.5327651515151515

I won't list every positive and negative because honestly, the negatives so outweigh the positives by, to quote Threepio in ESB, ""three thousand seven hundred and twenty to one.""

For example in the beginning theres a scene witth Hux and Poe that felt like something an SNL sketch would do. It felt a bit out of place for this universe. Also, a lot of the casino scenes (and characters) reminded me of the prequels. And by that I mean it was kind of kiddish. Like, you remember how silly Jar Jar was.....kind of like that. The porgs. Yes, they are cute. But they literally serve no purpose except to sell toys. I could be okay with them being created to sell merch if they at least did something in the movie. They honestly do not add anything and the runtime could have been shortened if they just cut them out. There was also a dumb scene with Leia where she basically became Starlord for a moment. It probably would have been better if she had just died in that moment or if she got injured in some other way. The scene felt kind of silly to me. Those were my major gripes.

Luke's badass move at the end of this movie reminded me a bit of Return of the Jedi, when he shows up at Jabba's all calm and collected, knowing he's going to take the place down.
Although I have to say, I was disappointed in Rey. She missed a big opportunity to take over the galaxy by turning down Kylo Ren. He would've been putty in her hands.

"Star Wars: The Last Jedi makes for an entertaining watch - if you can abide by some very poor screenwriting. The hype is definitely misleading. To the detriment of the series, this instalment ultimately does (irreparable?) damage to its own mythology, leading many ""hardcore"" fans to rebel and call for the episode to be struck from the ""canon"" - a call answered by more than 70,000 incensed audience members. Although I wouldn't go so far, I can't imagine exerting myself very much in defense of the story and the characters' motives. Sure, I enjoyed my cinema experience. Would I suggest it to others? Likely - if exclusively for an effects-heavy ride through intergalactic space. For an intensely emotional experience, I am inclined to direct one to Revenge of the Sith. The Last Jedi has its strong moments, but the worse ones dominate the better ones. Abrams surprisingly set up an exciting, fresh premise in The Force Awakens, and Johnson (curiously applauded by Disney for his less-than-amazing work) promptly tore most of its framework down again.

"I had a few issues with the other 7 Star Wars movies but very few compared to this film. First massive issue is the sub plot, surely going very slow in space isn't the best they could come up with? Second was the other sub plot, Canto Bight looked cool but the story of Finn and Rose there was boring. I like Finn and I didn't mind Rose but give them something more interesting to do. Other issues with this film : 1. I like Rey but we still don't know why she's even force sensitive or why we should invest in her character, 2. Kylo is the more interesting character and he is under used the whole film. 3. Luke is far to different to the old films, his character change makes no sense. 4. light speed crash made no sense to the lore of Star Wars, why would you need a death star if you could crash a ship into a planet? 5. Snoke, if he is actually dead I have a huge problem with the scene, why build up a character to get rid of them for no reason, this isn't game of thrones... 6. most of the ""jokes"" human characters made are totally out of place. 7. super Leia - could have made sense but they didn't explain how she could do that... 8.

There were questions during the last movie left unanswered which left me longing for this one to get answers to these questions. This movie seemed to provide a very bland explanation and those questions had no relevance to this movie (for example, Rey's parentage).

The movie chooses to go off track, violating every single one of the plot lines set out by the Force Awakens to the point of trolling, and rips out all of the mystery and stuff that makes Star Wars so Star Wars. Instead of filling this now gaping void with an original, rich new plot line as it should have done with this approach, you are left with a sea of painfully underdeveloped characters, weak Marvel-style humor throughout and a desperately pathetic plot-line clawing to break its excessively long run-time. 
The characters of Rey and Kylo Ren had their potential butchered without mercy. Instead of training to become a Jedi Knight, Rey is subject to watching Luke milk a spacecow and comically trotting around an island trying to hide from her. Instead of ascending to a deadly Sith Lord, or even rejoining the light side - Kylo Ren remains an emotionally unstable teenager with 0 development and has a temper tantrum every 2 minutes. The trade federation is honestly more intimidating than Kylo Ren. ",-0.09770150484436198,0.6036745001030716

What a piece of junk! You have seen the end of the Jedi, you will now witness the end of Star Wars!
After watching Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi, the least I can say is: its an epic adventure with all you want to see in a Star Wars film presented with all you don't want to see. Here is my list of 13 reasons to hate TLJ and 3 to live with it.
1. The script is full of plot holes. Without good lines, but the ones taken by previous films, the screenplay is always going against the wall and then turning back, either because the character can't die yet or the mission is failed. The writer doesn't decide if it's a drama or a comedy. We even ear Yoda and Luke saying it is time for the Jedi to die, and then ear Luke say I will not be the last Jedi. Where is the coherence?
2. Is it sci-fi? No, it's a sitcom. When the fake phone call of Poe Dameron to General ""Hugs"" starts in the beginning of the movie, most people thought they where in the wrong room, watching a parody. I believed it might be another advertisement for Star Wars products. But it went on with a battle of an X-Wing against a Star Destroyer. And what happens after Luke receives the light saber from Rey in the end of TFA? He dumps it backwards like he was joking about it. For me, Star Wars was always very serious, as it should be, but with a delightful humor, not the nonsense jokes of a comedy. Every good scene in TLJ tends to finish with a joke. Sometimes it looks like the Muppets show. 
3. Leia flies in space like a Holly Spirit or Jesus Christ. After the first battle, you see Kylo Ren deciding not to shoot at is mother, but then the other pilots destroy the cockpit killing her. Then we see Leia in space being able to fly like Super-Woman or a deity like Jesus Christ. Some fans recall this is a bubble made by the Force in the books. That's a reason why I don't read the expanded universe. It goes too far for me. And now they've gone too far. The Force never made deities.
4. The mission to the casino planet is pointless. Finn and Rose (a character created to increase success for Disney at Asiatic markets where Star Wars doesn't sell) go to a planet to find a hacker to help them decode a system that allows a Star Destroyer to follow the ship through hyperspace. They fail to get the hacker, return with another hacker and fail to complete the mission. You were only loosing your time watching it.
5. Who dies? Everyone dies, only to survive next, just to get memorable moments of heroic death. The screenplay is always on the verge of a climax and showing someone having an heroic death. But then, because they don't want to loose the characters, they get to survive, when it could be rewritten. It happens with Leia and with Finn who wants to sacrifice himself against a cannon. 
6. Snoke's background is not explored. I actually like the scene in which Kylo betrays Snoke. It was unexpected. But I'm very sad for not having a background story for Snoke. And I don't want to ear about it in the expanded universe.
7. The cave scene is meaningless. What could have been a great moment, the cave scene of the middle chapter, turns to nothing. In ESB, Luke fights Vader only to see his face under the mask, meaning that by facing Vader and killing him in hanger would make Luke evil like him. Now, Rey sees herself and it's revealed to her that she's alone. If she has no lineage in the Skywalker family, why making it a point? It's a no-fact work.
8. The main plotline is a star destroyer following a ship, but being unable to destroy it. Forty years ago we were introduced to a galaxy where a star destroyer followed a freighter, collected it with a tractor beam and invaded it. If any escape pod was released they would destroy it if there where life forms on it. Now the star destroyers are bigger and they can track a ship in lightspeed. Cool! But they can't destroy a ship straight ahead, because it's smaller and lighter and has a shield? Really? And this creates tension for hours. And when transports are released from the ship, they don't notice? Poe alerts about that, but Haldo and Leia disagree. I'm with Poe on this one! The First Order needs a code breaker taken by Finn and Rose to tell them that the transports are leaving the ship straight ahead? It makes no sense at all.
9. There is no art of creating worlds and creatures. For me Star Wars is art creation. In all Star Wars movies we see great worlds created with new creatures. That was Lucas! But they got it in The Force Awakens and Rogue One. Now all revolves around the Jedi and troops in space, the worlds are places for them to stop. And the casino planet doesn't impress at that level. I collect the books Art of Star Wars for each movie. What can it be found in this one?
10. The line ""You have no part in this story"". Is it a Mel Brooks flick? At the height of the fight with Snoke, Kylo tells Rey she's nobody and their parents aren't from the Skywalker family. I'm Ok with that! But then he says ""You have no part in this story"". No character in this movies ever said this was a story about the Skywalker family or the word part. I thought he was going to look at the audience and smile, like in a Mel Brooks flick, making a parody to Star Wars like Spaceballs.
11. The Galactic Alliance disappoints to help the Resistance. The final battle is a remake of the snow battle from Empire Strikes Back and the battles from Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit of a mine under the mountain being attacked. Ok! But then the screenplay remembers the Resistance to ask for help to their allies and friends in the galaxy. And they don't reply. What could have been a show of friendship and freedom fight, like in LOTR and The Hobbit, becomes an ungrateful task for the Resistance to fight for a galaxy that doesn't deserve them, that doesn't care about the fight. Then again, we learn from the code breaker that all this war is for the rich to make weapons for the bad and the good guys, so the morale is why fight? Anyway, we can also say that all this Star Wars are for Disney to sale toys, so why watch it?
12. It disappoints all expectations generated by The Force Awakens and Rogue One. This movie is all we feared from Disney when it took Lucasfilm, but then they gave us TFA and RO, we believed in them, they where good, we wanted to know more about the characters Snoke and Rey. It's even worst to destroy those films.
13. And there are the porgs. These stupid creatures have no role but to give quick laughs at the end of each scene. They are worst then Jar Jar Binks or the Ewoks, at least he had a role to play.",0.047128334628334635,0.5420630809519699
The Last Jedi is certainly an improvement over the shallow Force Awakens. It's a far more textured affair all round and there is plenty here to get lost in. The effects are stunning plus the surprises are many and unexpected which makes for a good viewing experience.,0.20809523809523806,0.6138095238095238
"Terrible. I don't think of myself as a super-fan or a geek but I've loved all the previous starwars. I felt let down by TFA. But with this film I felt empty leaving the theater and after an evening of discussing it with my brothers we all found a profound sense of frustration and anger. 
What could have been an incredible and epic movie was stifled, muted, and disjointed. They took the single greatest distinguishing handful of aces that the Star Wars universe possesses and left it unused: The Force(The struggle between selfless justice and selfish injustice IE:Jedi and Sith) This should always be the center plot point for a Starwars main episode. The reason StarWars is so much better than many other Sci Fi creations is due directly to the epic struggle to keep justice using the force(JEDI) while others seek to use this force for their own personal acquisition of power(Sith) Star wars needs to have a pure, powerful, evil villain to be at it's best. I believe if Kylo had Killed Hux it would make him much more menacing and powerful, I hated him after TFA but now he's the most likable character for me. These movies should be exploring the Jedi and the Sith more in depth and with much better Sith/Jedi character development. Just to give you a taste of my own feelings on star wars: I do think the originals are the best. I loved most things involving vader, the vader-luke-emperor scenes in TROTJ(also almost all the original characters had great depth), Loved the duels at the end of revenge of the sith were(yoda and palpatine with the lightning hands and Anakin vs Kenobi), I loved the darth maul mystique and his duel with Qui gon jinn and Kenobi. However these recent movies made Anakin and Padme's performances actually seem decent comparably. I LOVE the Starwars universe and when I heard they were making more I hoped for movies more along the lines of the Knights of the Old Republic cinematics and storylines. That's perhaps hoping for too much. But this utterly horrible movie destroyed ALL gravity and emotion I had tied into Starwars. I can't consider this canon and don't know If I can even watch any more down this storyline. I have always loved all the Starwars for the universe in which it existed, I could even Ignore Jar-Jar as a one off and appreciate the good parts of the phantom menace. But this this is a horrible array of flat characters and dead end storylines that make me want to see everyone die except Kylo and possibly Rey.
I could go on for hours about the physics problems: gravity bend on lasers, open space with the bomber pilot wearing no space suit, all the ships accelerating at the same rate for a permanent chase, weaponizing light speed, the first order can't jump in front, etc.
 Also: Lando was Amazing one of my favorite characters,I also Loved Mace Windu however on the flipside: I've wanted Finn to Die since he risked everyones life like a selfish immature idiot in TFA. I've loved Leah and Also Rey so far but the Holdo was just a horrific leader. Were they supposed to wait and follow her order to do nothing as everyone and everything they loved and gave everything for was destroyed? Obviously you can't follow ANYONE blindly, so their duty to their cause demanded action and recourse,(obviously use the light speed trick with your other ships or at least once you're the last one on the ship, An Admiral of her caliber would be thinking way ahead.) 
Finn and Rose were useless and pointless character wise and story wise.
They destroyed Luke, and tarnished his heroism. His character and personality were completely ruined by Rian Johnson and Lukes decisions didn't make any sense. This movie destroyed all storylines and character lines of any original characters. They destroy any buildup of character and questions of origin constructed by Abrams in TFA. I hate most of the new characters and I hate the lack of exploration of the Jedi and Sith arts, they aren't some hokey religion they are real disciplines with secrets and nuance and Millenia of history Dark and Bright. Instead Rey picks it up overnight. UUugh. Last note: Yeah lets free the animals(fine) but leave the slave children who will be beaten or killed for letting them go. (WHAAAAAAT??!!!) 
I could literally go on for hours and have already. It's just that the Starwars Universe has practically unlimited potential and in a couple of movies(especially the latter) it seems to have been smashed and shoved into a money making heartless adventure-less characterless cookie cutter. I've always loved Starwars and this is utterly lazy, terrible and clearly written by people who do not care for it as so many do. 
Obviously these are just movies, but they're some of my very favorite and most dearly beloved and I feel as if they've been defiled. Someone who doesn't know the story or care about it is telling it and it's all so wrong. Truly truly frustrating.",0.11899539882240764,0.5888834132137705

"The last Jedi is, like the previous movie was a copy of star wars 1, in many aspects a copy of the empire strikes back movie, there are so many similar elements.

On the other hand, there was enough originality here to make the film compelling, although at 2.5 hours, it's hard to not keep checking your watch after the first hour. Tips for Ep9: less Finn, less Poe, less Kylo, MORE REY. She and Rose steal this film, truly. Acting wise, maybe this is a minority opinion, but Adam Driver is just a waste of celluloid. He's cringeworthy every time he tries to act. It's a shame Carrie Fisher died, because it would have been nice to see her emerge in Ep9 with Rey and other strong female characters.

"First of all you're gonna watch the movie so don't bother reading reviews just watch it.
I personally liked it, unlike most of the people I know that have watched it.
Their main points are that things differ too much from the previous movies, i.e. how the characters react. Then again most cried about the last Episode which was, and I quote, 'too similar to A New Hope'. I completely understand why some feel this way as I too felt a bit disappointed back then, what I do not understand is why the same people are currently upset because too much is different. And they are not even correct in their points. I.e. why Luke went into exile following his ""failure"" as a master, when we saw the exact same thing with Yoda. One of the few points I can agree with is that Rey just seemed too strong without any training, that being in combat with a light saber and her control over the force, but that is intertwined with the concept of building a new ""hero and villain"". Anyways I could go on but I have no intentions of addressing each and every point someone has made.
The other main thing that that people dislike is all the forced comedy, to that I can only agree. I'm pretty sure they just wanted to sell some merchandise after seeing all those unnecessary scenes.

But that also doesn't mean it's automatically successful. That's why it's called a 'risk'. Most of the time you fall flat on your face...like this movie.",0.1548184769775679,0.5479609405745769

But at a time when the devoted are scathing other films for not being long enough and feeling rushed, my feeling is that this film could have done with a closer shave(if you get that then I've found my audience) quite easily 30 to 40 mins could disappear from this and I don't think anybody would have noticed, it then truly could have been the equal of if not the best in series.

"""Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi"", from ""Looper"" director Rian Johnson, is the latest entry in the ""Star Wars"" franchise and does it live up to the hype? For me, sadly, this 8th episode was a bit of a disappointment. Sure, it offers some good performances from Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill and Adam Driver, it has some pretty cool action scenes,the score from John Williams is expectedly good and in my opinion slightly better than the score for ""The Force Awakens"", the CGI is decent, there's some good camera work and for the 2 hour and 32 minute run time the pacing is not terrible. For me what made ""The Last Jedi"" a bit of a disappointment was for one thing that it felt all too safe and family friendly. There were moments throughout the film where I thought the filmmakers would take some risks, but just ended up going the predictable and at times cheesy route. There were even a few times where I remember thinking to mysely ""Wow, is that actually going to happen?"", but then it didn't or something else happened and possible major events were avoided. There wasn't all that much tension throughout the run time either and I left the cinema rather underwhelmed and the film failed to leave an impact. Despite really wanting to love the film considering I'm a ""Star Wars"" fan myself, I just couldn't really wrap my head around the overly long 152 minute run time and the needless sub-plots, especially the side quest with Finn that constantly slowed down the pace, took up way too much time and overall just didn't need to be there. The comedy doesn't always work and is mostly child-oriented, especially the introduction to the creatures found on the Ahch-To island known as ""Porgs"" that are basically there to boost merchandise sales and don't really play into the story much at any point. Another thing that surprised me was how much Princess Leia Organa, played by Carrie Fisher (Rest In Peace) in her last portrayal of the character, didn't have to do with the story. Aside from 1-2 short scenes, Leia was, in my opinion, kind of wasted and could've been utilized a lot more. Talking about the supporting cast, there aren't any standouts, the best performances are definitely those from Ridley, Hamill and Driver, the rest just aren't as strong, new characters don't leave an impact and returning characters were more enjoyable to watch in ""The Force Awakens"". Negatives aside, I still think you can watch ""The Last Jedi"", it isn't a complete failure, it has its entertaining moments and is enjoyable to watch (especially with friends and/or the family) if you're not expecting too much and there are definitely some funny moments and homages to the older films that will probably make fans crack a smile. It's clear that Rian Johnson is a big fan of the franchise and wants to make the best kind of ""Star Wars"" film that he can, but in comparison to J.J. Abrams's previous effort, I think ""The Last Jedi"" just doesn't hold up. All in all, I'm kind of disappointed with ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"", maybe it was due to the high expectations I had for the film, but it just didn't do it for me. It felt way too family friendly, the subplots are mostly unnecessary and could have been easily cut out, the film isn't that rewatchable and it just seemed a bit rushed to name a few things. The scenes between Rey, Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren were definitely the most interesting to watch in the entire film and those actors definitely gave the best performances. The action scenes were also entertaining with the decent camera work and CGI, but I feel the majority of the film was overall still just rather lackluster and played it too safe. The supporting cast isn't as strong as the main cast and some of the interesting plot points established in the previous film, for example where and who Rey's parents are, feel like they are just thrown away in this sequel. Although not quite as terrible as the prequels, this is definitely not one of the best ""Star Wars"" films to ever come out and I would say it's pretty much as good as ""Rogue One"", if not, a little better.",0.1682878554059109,0.4761326225215114

This movie was the biggest disappointment I've viewed on the big screen in a long time. Questions and plots from Force Awakens were ignored or used as the setup for punchlines. I get the general feeling the writer was trying to be smarter than the audience by fooling us at every corner. That's okay but you can't ignore logic. And having almost every previous characters in the original trilogy and force awakens flip their character arc180 degrees with no character development to throw the audience off is just lazy. Star Wars fans are fans because we care about going on a ride with characters that are compelling. I re-watched the original trilogy recently. What they've done with the original trilogy characters in this movie made me lose the magic in watching the original trilogy. Like re-living watching your favorite teams win championships only to find out years later they were all just cheaters and the game was rigged. A complete let down in the previously established legacy. So I guess this movie has ruined the original trilogy for me.

"First of all sry for my english.
I liked the visuals and the music but I dont see any more good thing about this movie.
The movie was too long and feeled in some parts like a parody of Star Wars. Especially when Leia is flying through space. That was very cringy and I didnt get how she can do that because she's not even a trained jedi as far as I know. Its too op and I didnt like it.
The first order is a joke, especially General Hux. In the original trilogy vader would kill him after his second mistake but snoke doesnt care... hm kay
The humour is horrible and destroys serious moments.
The character development was bad and Luke feels like a completly different person. He lost hope and wanted to kill ben because he saw the dark side in him? Luke was the ONLY ONE who saw the good in vader!!! Luke had always hope and he would never try to kill Ben.... And why does he have to milk that alien thing and drink it in front of Rey? Should that be funny? Thats so horrible.
The whole plot with Finn and Rose is so unneccessary and only because holdo didnt want to tell what the plan is. 
Porgs suck.
There are very unsatisfying answers to the huge questions of Episode 7. 
RJ throw the things from JJ away. Reys parents? Nobodys! She is so good in everything because the plot wants it. I thought they will come with an answer for her being so damn good at everything but actually no, shes a Mary Sue.
Rose is annoying and oh what a coincidence that they find another codebreaker in their cell. I thought Maz told them that there is only one person who would be good enough for that...
The casino planet doesnt feel like star wars. They get arrested for parking wrong. Really???
Why can holdo fly through snokes ship with hyper space? That destroys so many things in star wars. They could have done that with the death star too, why didnt they do it back then using an autopilot.
There are so many unlogical things and unsatisfying moments that I really couldnt enjoy it.
I could say so many more things I didnt like such as Phasma being a throw away charater like in the last movie or kylo Ren not realising that luke is tricking him and stuff like that.
This movie nearly destroyed Star Wars for me.
Rey is still a Mary Sue, there is nearly no training on that island.
Leia can fly through space with the force without training.
Because? They are woman? I dont want to discuss that further...
The last jedi isnt respecting the old films and characters, The last jedi is horrible and I couldnt care less about this movie. It also doenst feel that new, there are a lot of inspirations from the old films such as Rey seeing the good in kylo ren and then goes to him (Ep. 6) + there are also many quotes from other star wars movies. Kylo Ren sounds lie his grandfarther, together we can rule the galaxy blablabla I thought this movie wants to try something new but I was wrong it only disappoints...

"Following on from a poor, uninspired rehash of A New Hope ( The Force Awakens), The Last Jedi puts the final nail in the coffin of a once cherished movie franchise. The plot is bizarre, erratic, but ultimately fairly dull. The acting in the movie is generally poor, with Daisy Ridley delivering lines about "" the force"" that genuinely made the me cringe and wince in my seat. A Star Wars film without a lightsaber fight is like a comedy film without jokes (What's the point ?). I found myself genuinely not caring if Finn killed himself by driving into a laser beam. A sentiment I shared with all the characters in this film. The trotting out of the old cast (Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher) once again demonstrated a true lack of creativity and imagination.

"Ok, its hard for me to write this review. Its really hard for me to dislike a STAR WARS movie, i am somewhat positively biased against STAR WARS. The first time i saw the movie at the premier i was stunned, and shocked on how poorly written and how ridiculous the plot is, i however, hoped that in a second viewing i would come around and like the movie just a little bit more, so i could forgive the poor story choices. But in my second viewing i noticed much more writing and creative decisions that dont´t make any sense, story-wise, character-wise, logic-wise, starwars universe-wise.

"People giving movies these low scores should be given a criteria to mark against. The special effects alone are worth a better score than three. If they are not happy with the storyline then they can mark it down. The acting, costumes and music deserve a few points so already we have at least five. Just the atmosphere at the Star Wars with the history and characters make non sci fi viewers like Star Wars. 
I saw the very first one when my children were young so each one evokes memories for me. I did enjoy the movie and it was a family celebration which made it special. Was it the best Star Wars film, well obviously not, but it was also not the worst one.
Would I recommend it to others, of course, go without huge expectations but look for the Star Wars themes, costumes, much loved characters never to be seen again, music and the overall emotional aspect that brings back Star Wars fans again and again.",0.11351095993953136,0.4435752078609222
If you want space battles and special effects only I guess this movie would rate ok for you. If you want good storytelling as well this movie is a mess. It tried too hard to give new characters screen time without giving me any reason to care for them. The whole casino mission was a waste of time for what it didn't add to the movie and what could have been added to the Luke training Rey storyline. I understand the torch needs to be passed to create new stories but you don't need to basically give the finger to the original movies to do that. Even Luke's change of character could work if it was set up better. It's a cop out to say all the fan backlash is because The Last Jedi wasn't the movie the die hard fans had in their heads and you will never satisfy everyone.

I am not going to give a detailed analysis of the movie here. It is obvious that people have loved and hated it in equal measure. I am just here as a casual viewer, who has not read these comics and was only mildly keen on watching this movie, until I went and saw it the day it released. I couldn't resist the Force (sorry). Even now, four days later, it is all I can think about. I did not read any review before booking the tickets and thank God I didn't cause I would've missed a great movie. The movie had me glued from the theme song and I did not want it to end. Every scene was beautifully shot and performed, especially the Force Bond ones between Ben/Kylo Ren and Rey and my favourites were the team-up and Luke's ""deception"". The light speed explosion was visually stunning. Kudos to the visual effects team. I must congratulate Rian Johnson and all the cast and crew for taking such a huge risk and pulling it off tremendously well. Haters are going to find faults anyway and although I have read some of their views, they fail to mention why exactly they hated it, and frankly, I don't give a damn. For me, The Last Jedi is the movie of the year (sorry, Diana) and an epic sequel to the Force Awakens in terms of character and story development. I am very excited for Episode IX.",0.06311728395061729,0.633641975308642
"This films honors the complexity of characters, especially those deemed ""villains"". Character is not sacrificed for skeptical, which I think is often the case for the JJ Abram star wars films.

"Okay just the title ""LAST JEDI"" hits me like a wall and I am still reeling from a huge patricide scene in ""Force Awakens"", a movie marketed to children on pasta boxes and soup cans. I was born in 1970 and the STAR WARS stories I grew up with gave me an unusual amazing hero who said, ""I will not fight you Father!""
To remain positive however I want to thank Disney for their huge Jedi party foul because it serves to remind so many of us how great were episodes 1-6! (Yes McGregor, Christensen and Portman gave us great performances!) I am not saying writers have no right to write new STAR WARS stories. Just the opposite. I want to thank JJ Abrams and company for inspiring me to write my own STAR WARS stories that have very little to do with theirs. 
Yes the tragedy of Ren can be felt and hope can endure as Luke can live to 500+ years and in the company of several last Jedi who survived the Clone War years and come out of exile with their children and students...that's the way I write it.

1) Why the build up of Rey's parents, if they were nobody?

"When I walking out from a theatre in 1977 after watching Star Wars I was happy to see a film I can relate to. When the second film came out, I was really excited and couldn't wait to see the third installment and care for those enthralling and beloved characters I learned to love.
When the trilogy of prequels came out. believe me, I was OK with them. I know that George Lucas really tried too hard to please hardcore fans. I have respect for the man because he allowed fans to create a big and expanding Universe for the saga. And then... Episode 7 and 8 hammered everybody's head. This new episode in particular, was an insult to me and to other fans of this beautiful universe and was a spit in the eye of Lucas and to the legacy of the main characters. The writers and director of this film stomped on all literature, comics, animated series, and videogames that always had the decency of protecting of the canon. That was the only rule imposed by Lucas to anyone wanting to create a fanfic or a novel: Never to break the canon. And what's the first thing Disney did? They broke the canon and sent the Expanded Universe to the trash bin.
After the film ended a man asked me: 'Oh, good sir, are you crying because Luke was killed?'
I replied: No, Mister, I cry because they've killed an entire saga.",0.19672865013774105,0.47028236914600546

"No, seriously, ""defying expectations"" seems to be the only thing they wanted to do in this film, and you can take that in just about any context you like. Serious scenes had gags, lighthearted scenes had serious casualties, ""the one thing we need to do"" was several ""one things"" that never happened, the ancient Jedi religion wasn't so important, the entire mission with the new character was a misdirection, Luke was rumored to go bad (and didn't), Rey was supposed to learn the Force and her history (she didn't), the showdown with the Sith was both brutal and slapstick at the same time (and not in a good way like Army of Darkness), and a significant portion of the movie (and the casualties) could've been avoided if the senior Rebel leadership took 20 seconds to explain the plan to key leadership.

"This movie is already being criticised and largely hated as people declare ""Disney has killed Star Wars' ""This isn't the Star Wars we all love"" I myself was sad watching the movie, not because the movie was bad but because I knew people wouldn't understand why this film is so important and what a genius thing Rian did with the universe of Star Wars as a whole. Yes this is the end of Star Wars as we know, and the bold new step into something new and exciting. It's no longer just the dark side vs the light this film ingeniously throws that black and white morality out the window in one harsh move and declares that Star Wars is evolving into something deeper. This is a movie that can very easily be spoiled but the spoilers aren't superficial like someones parentage or secret name instead the spoilers are the things that set off this change in vision. This is all summarised in Kylo Ren who in this film evolves into the most fascinating Star Wars villain we've ever seen it's as he said in the trailer ""let the past die, kill it if you have to its the only way to become what you were meant to be"" and thats what Rian Johnson does here, he lays Star Wars to rest only for it to rise again more spectacular than ever. The old Star Wars bows out in some of the most beautiful scenes we've seen in the franchise with Luke and Leia both having their finest hour. It was indeed time for the Jedi to end and for something new to be born and continue the legacy of the galaxy far far away. Let's just hope they find someone a little more interesting than Rey to do it because unfortunately she is the biggest weak link and any semblance of character she had is dropped and she is now the Mary Sue we all feared her to be, this is a negative in an otherwise wonderful cast of interesting characters. In conclusion Last Jedi is not the best Star Wars film but it will be the most important one for decades to come and I sense that all the backlash it's getting for having the courage to do something new and controversial will one day turn into the admiration I and many others feel as we see this movie for what it is.",0.17687137330754352,0.6303513862024499

The skywalker legacy has been thrown away like garbage.... the character development of Rey and Kylo Ren (Ben Solo) also wasn't in the movie at all.. Rey getting 3 tiny lessons and becomes powerful.. or as luke said 'I've only seen this raw strength once in my life' ... The side quest Finn & Rose had, was very unnessacery, if they left that part away, it wouldn't make the movie any better though, but at least it would've saved me some time... halve way through the movie, I almost fell a sleep, it just couldn't make it interesting for me... one positive thing though, the visuals.. and the 'action' was pretty cool.. But next to all the cliché stuff though... it's so lame, so predictable.. they might talk so 'good' about this movie.. but I dont see it... the choices that were made were wrong, and I dont see how this movie got praised so much.. it's a true shame that this movie is called 'star wars' JJ abrams has a huge thing to do with the number IX, but I do believe a lot of people have lost interest already in this franchise, some might call it 'bold' decisions Rian made, but I acan't stand behind them.. it's unfortunate to see the classic characters fade away like this.. especially Luke... Though Leia was the worst of all, how she can blown up and then flew back to the ship, was just out of character and to a point so disney-ish and hilarious, I laughed out loud when I saw they did that... after 30 years she felt the force and flew back to the ship? give me a break...

Ben Solo wanted to be the new Darth Vader... and that´s what he made all the way. 
On the other side, the movie shows us that ANYONE can be a hero, because each person thinks different. A fighter pilot wants to take out the enemy and survive, even that he loses his entire squadron, if the mission is completed, it was a great mission and the losses are normal. For an Admiral, there are other options and even that nobody cares, it need to hide from any enemy or spies, until the end... even that it costs people lifes but saves much more. That´s something that people tend to forget and want do see victories and defeats. 
Only the ones that survive can say they where there and lost less than the ones that died. 
All the movie is based on that. On the 4 acts, that´s the main point of the entire story. Anyone can be hero since everyone wants do survive but only the ones that are cautious can do it and will lose many on that escape.

"The Last Jedi was an absolute thrill ride of a film, and really sets up an amazing finale for Episode 9. The movie was well cast, and the pacing and excitement builds and flows to its ultimate and legendary climax. The space battles were top-of-the-line Star Wars, and the addition of Laura Dern and Benicio Del Toro really gave the film that extra ""kick"" it needed. Kelly Marie Tran also surprised many in her heart-warming role as Rose Tico. The new planets were incredible, especially Crait...and I can't say enough about Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley. Their chemistry is amazing, and it will be a treat to see how their stories end up in the next chapter. Well done, Rian Johnson and Disney!",0.2962566844919787,0.6159536541889483

"I find it odd that people think this movie is so bad. I think it was because viewer's heads were on a swivel the whole time. The expectations for this movie were too simple, original, and based on fan theories. When people didn't get what they wanted, they called it the worst movie ever. I agree I wanted Luke's role to be stronger, Finn and Rose to have a more meaningful part, and a Snoke backstory, but it is what it is. I think because this took a step away from the textbook write up for a Star Wars movie people are hating on it. I am sure if people understand the point of the movie to move forward in the story instead of more cameos and the same lines, there would be much more appreciation. I myself did not like a good number of what happened in the movie, but you have to understand the reasoning behind it and realize that, it had some killer moments in there that made people amazed. I hate how this is tearing Star Wars fandom apart, but there will never be satisfaction. TFA was too similar to the originals, and it was criticized, now the TLJ is not that similar to the original, and is being criticized. Just recognize the good aspects of both and lets wait until 9.

"Starwars never has to be brilliant or artistic. it was interesting because it bring new concepts for epic stories in new ages, so we dismiss the series weaknesses before. this new, so called, saga first chapter ""force awankens"" was exactly the ""new hope"" but at least we have some duels, some sithes and some jedies. but this one, we have a puppet of Luke Skywalker, and no fight, no new great sith- kylo ren is absolute kickass, like kids we bullied in the first grade, everyone, exactly everyone beat him, and Snoke is a mummy which you can really omit him from movie without any damages to this movie- in return you have lots of jet fighting scene whihc realistic movies with plane fights are far better in it, so here is the question for the director, writer and the company: why have you made a starwars?????
this movie along with "" rouge one"" are really bad movies from top to down, starwars has already been bad movies without plot and characters development and so on, nut they were new age kong-fu movies with new concepts and ideas, but these new ones are all the before without those good things. result: don't other even watch.",0.16916579588993386,0.5132270985719262

"This is almost the opposite in everyway to The Force Awakens. While JJ Abrams brought a very fast-paced energetic but very familiar and safe feel to The Force Awakens, Rian Johnson brings to The Last Jedi something that is slower, patient and refreshing new and unexpected. Johnson isn't too concerned with trying to satisfy every Star Wars fan but is very invested in swinging big in every direction that is risky but for most of it really pays off. 
Using a very meta-type of narrative to go against tropes one would expect in Star Wars, Johnson makes the audience question the identity of this space opera franchise that has been going on since the 70's. The film delves on the flaws of the past, religion, teachers, authority and idolized heroes and asks what is worth sacrificing during times of war. And just when you think the movie is ending the way you would expect; it takes a hard left turn to deliver a great third act.",0.20410984848484853,0.37564393939393936

"I waited a long time to do this review to calm down again after the abhorrent bad taste in my mouth from Episode VII was only covered over by slightly less distasteful VIII. After the reboot Michael Bay version of Episode IV that J.J. gave us in VII this was actually a little better and actually had a few original parts. My big problem was how they somehow had not one person explain how the laws of motion work in a vacuum to these people. Really, it's a space movie people, c'mon!
When it was announced J.J. was being put in charge of IX I knew it was partly because of all the whiners over VIII. Its because of those fans crying over the prequels that the people who actually appreciate Star Wars and understand Lucas now has to endure the insult of Disney owning it, putting J.J. in charge to ruining the franchise. VII was an insult and VIII did little to make up for it and if they would have just had a little input form Star Wars fans older than 40 it would have still been just as big but actually made sense and not appear as if they tied a hack writer to a chair after he watched Episode IV once and then held a gun to his head and told him to write a screenplay in a day.

"Yes, I believe that personally, the last jedi is one if not the best of the Star Wars movies. Now at first walking out of the theater I had a ton of questions. I had a lot to process and I wasn't even sure if I liked it or not. But, after I watched it a second time, I found I was enjoying myself and I was sucked in by the beautiful imagery and epic conclusion. Now I will admit this movie does have flaws, no doubt, but I think when you look at this film through a bigger scope it will begin to make sense. Remember a lot of people didn't like empire strikes back at first. When it first came out people were confused and weren t sure what to make of it. Not until Return of the Jedi when everything connected and the story was complete that all the 'plot holes' or mistakes in Empire began to make sense and it became a classic. I think this movie can do the same. I also think many of the reasons this movie was so divisive was because of the twists and turns. I loved many of the twists upon second viewing, they were crazy and original and I never would have guessed them. I think because of all the speculation on the internet about this movie, with people coming up with their own theories was what caused some people to be disappointed. I think some people didn't expect what transpired in the movie and their theories didn't come true so they were frustrated by the fact that it wasn't the exact thing they wanted. If a movie had all the twists and plot that you expected it would be boring, right? So congrats to Rian Johnson on making a movie that was so beautiful and intricate and that contained so many big twists and turns that he can call his own. ",0.1899292149292149,0.5127520377520378

Good:
. Rian Johnson creates a film that is distinctive in tradition and humour to the rest of the franchise which is interesting to see
. Performances are brilliant, particularly Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill and Adam Driver
. Visual effects are still awesome(It is Star Wars obviously)
. Good messages and themes of atoning for ones mistakes
. Brilliant action scenes, if not as innovative as the prequels and originals.
Bad:
.Humour is sometimes overused, which sometimes affects the emotional weight of the film
. The plot is lacking and contains some plot holes particularly inconstencies with the previous installment.
. Finn and Poe's subplots are lacking
. Some characters lack development
. still asks more questions than it answers
Overall, I would recommend this film to any major star wars fan and sci-fi fan, however this film will not agree with any star wars fan but my advice is just to give it a shot and see for youselves.

The acting was great all around, especially from Mark Hamill and Adam Driver. The special effects were superb and the filmography was the best in any Star Wars Movie. This is a beautiful movie. Rain Johnson has a unique style that worked so well on smaller budget projects (A few of the best Breaking Bad Episodes, Looper) and explodes with splendor here. The plot is unexpected and perfect, not only for the overarching Star Wars mythos but also for the era and circumstances surrounding this movie. This is the Ninth feature length Star Wars movie. If you want the same old tired rendition of this space opera you have eight other movies you can watch. The Last Jedi is fresh and exciting and pumps a ton of creative energy into the series, on par with Lucas at his prime.

Literally every movie ever has plot holes if you nit pick it apart and most of the plot holes I've heard people complain about in this movie can be rationalized through internal Star Wars logic or by the filmmakers choice on direction.

Poe's conversation with Hux over the comms was clearly a stalling technique, even pointed out in the movie. the hyperspace tracker, though explained clearly through canon sources after the OT to be in development, still didn't stop lots of fans from trying to pass it off as lazy writing and impossible to do, apparently in fantasy relms it's possible! The ""Mary Poppins"" thing clearly showed how the force was connected to Leia. And just recently i read one about Luke's metal hand disappearing when he died, that was weak even then, turns out the scene was so far away you couldn't even tell if it had or hadn't.

"DISNEY decided to turn the franchise into a MARVEL movie, devoid of any of theory and depth. But the worst part of watching this film is the weak and childish script:
1) The ""universe"" is not consistent. Magical Jedi powers spring out of nowhere to support cringe-worthy twist plots in outer space(!) and are used by people never to have shown such competence in the Force. 
This means that anything can happen which also means that it basically forces the audience to only focus at the visuals because consistency, story line don't really matter and anything can happen.
(2) It's all a huge joke. Humor was always part of the SW saga. But now it's all about situational comedy with some chasing in between.
(3) As the middle part of the trilogy, it fails to deliver. Not to go ""ancient Greek theater"" on you guys but a trilogy is all about (a)Good guys are on the rise, (b) Good buys suffer/bad guys win (c) Good guys win. This film is an unsatisfying combination of b+c, where good and evil fight forever after. Honestly, there is no underlying important reason to film the next movie. Nothing to expect!
(4) I start to be annoyed by all the political correctness and forced diversity out of Hollywood. The choice of a female hero combined with a black co-lead was courageous and worked well in the previous film... because it made sense!!!. Now
(a) it looks as if Disney said that we need an Asian woman in the mix and wrote a boring and outlandish sub-plot that took her from being a guard, to being Steve Jobs and then a pilot. The whole plot can be thrown out and the story does not change!
(b) I get ""girl power"" (and I loved Rey in TFA!!) , but at a point when you are watching war scenes and almost all secondary characters (pilots, commanders, generals etc) are women, you have to say to yourself that this seems forced and intentional. I once knew war is tough and physically challenging.",0.02888982732732733,0.5317567567567567

"»The Last Jedi« (TLJ) is the »Empire Strikes Back« (ESB) of our days. It proves that Star Wars is not bound to endlessly recycle its predecessors' nostalgia focus nor retread anything the original trilogy (OT) did. The OT movies are a special case of lightning striking. Rehashing what they did would be fruitless, but rethinking why the achieved what the did is exactly what TLJ is doing. It pays reference to the greatest and most foundational theme in Star Wars: Hope. And it develops, in Kylo Ren, the most complex villain ever, and with Rey a hero that chooses to be a hero - not unlike Luke Skywalker in the very first Star Wars movie. It is a divisive movie for some, but it approaches you with an open heart and if you approach the movie just like that, you are in for a ride of a lifetime. TLJ is doing for Star Wars today what ESB has done for Star Wars back then: it gives it a future beyond its past.",0.21450892857142861,0.4435267857142857

"The Last Jedi is simply amazing. It is universally aclaimed by critics and concidered by many one of the best films of the year and the best in the franchise since The Empire Strikes Back. Unfortunately, there is a group of fans that are outraged by the film because it is original and dares to take the series to new places so they say it doesn't feel like Star Wars so the imdb rating for the film is criminally low(7.6 at the time I wright the review) Offcourse, I respect other opinions and thoughts about the film. 
 Story:
The Last Jedi is original and shocking while it honours the rich legacy of the Saga. It has twists and revelation that will keep you in the edge of your seat. Despite it's runtime it never feels over-long or boring and it's totally necesarry for the characters to be fully developed. The tone is very dark and gives you a feeling of despair. Overral, the film is unpredictable,dark and has some wisecrack humor (that may feel a bit forced but it never fells flat and doesn't affect the dark tone) and is filled with great characters.
 The characters:
As I said the characters really stood out . I won't get to any spoilers but the film did a very good job with making it's characters complex and developed. Rey may be concidered by some Mary Sue but in The Last Jedi she is more human and flawed. Kylo Ren really steals the show by being one of the most emotionally complex and lovable villains in recent history and his character arc was impresssive and it showed the conflict of his character. Luke on the other hand is way more dark and sarcastic than the original trilogy. Some people didn't like that because it ruins their childhood hero but for most critics and for me that change in character was very well explained and it showed a more realistic side of his character. The supporting characters were also very good. Poe, Finn and the new addition Rose had personalities and a lot of chatacter building moments. 
 Rian Johnson:
The writer-director of the film is one of the greatest new filmakers that directed indie and smaller films like the Brick and Looper and he also made some of the best Breaking Bad episodes. His script was simply phenomenal and his direction took the film and the whole series to new level. He made one of the biggest blockbusters of the year into an amazing film with artistic feel and quality something that most recent big budget films don't have because they focus to much on action, stars and bad cgi. I would dare and call it the biggest arthouse movie. (I don't say that modern big budget films aren't artistic. i.e. Blade Runner 2049 , Logan, Wonder Woman, War for the Planet of the Apes.) 
 Star Wars:
As I've mentioned the film takes the series to new places but also honours it's legacy. All those things above made me as a film geek love this movie but the lore, the references and the whole asthetic made my inner Star Wars fun love this film even more.
 Flaws:
I don't want to sound like a fanboy and I recognise the flaws of the movie. There is a whole sequence in the 2nd act in Canto Bight that felt a bit forced and it wasn't as good as the rest of the film. The first few minutes were also not that great. The humor felt a bit out of place and annoying some times and I wished that it wasn't there but it was funny.
 
The Last Jedi deserves your attention. It is mind-blowing. I don't want to insult people that didn't like it and I respect their opinion but for many and myself this was an amazjng experience.",0.1550559947299078,0.46696805006587616

"I'm personally writing this review to show that there are fans of TLJ. I found it a fresh of breathe air and in my opinion the risks pulled of better than I thought.
First my main complaints. Yes the writing for Rose and Holdo wasn't good, I understood why they were there but they didn't add that much, Rose was just unnecessary but no where in a galaxy far far away as bad as jar jar, and Holdo is a character I feel would have had development in a previous movie but just wasn't pulled off right, bit swapping he rout for akbar wouldnt fix anything, in my opinion it would have detracted from the film. And the casino sub plot was unnecessary and it could have been put to better use by building the character of phasma, but its only like 20 minutes in this 2hr long movie so on 2nd viewing it didn't drag like I first thought.

"I don't really get why so many people hated this movie. As a Star Wars entry, it's pretty decent. 
I only have one complaint: it needed more aliens. Star Wars is a space opera. A big part of the magic of the first movies was being transported to a universe bursting with alien species interacting with each other and humans being thrown in the middle of that endless ocean of space oddities.
This movie is too human-centric. Where are the Yodas, Jabbas, ewoks, etc....? (yes, I even almost missed Jar-Jar Binks... almost). Even Chewbacca was relegated to being a f...ing extra in this movie. I'd be surprised if his total screen time exceeded five minutes.
Star Wars is not Battlestar Galactica. Bring back the magic! Make the next one more epic!
Like I said, this one was a decent Star Wars. Better than the prequels, not even close to being as good as the Empire Strikes Back though, despite what's been said by some idiotic critics. Could've been better but it was nowhere near franchise-destroying as some would have you believe.",0.11055555555555555,0.5075

"So,when I heard that Star Wars The Last Jedi will be release this year I really wanted to see the movie and to see if it will be better than Star Wars The Force Awakens.And it is as good as the prequel,not better and not worst than it.
The thing is that,if the company as well as the directors of the upcoming Star Wars movies will continue in this direction than the hole Star Wars franchise will soon be ruined and hated by the fans.
What do I want to say by that? Well,by that I want to say that if the directors of the upcoming Star Wars movies will continue to kill the major characters as well as the minor ones from the old Star Wars movies,than the franchise won't survive with the characters from the new Star Wars movies.
They already killed in just two Star Wars movies 2 major characters from the old Star Wars movies and those are Luke Skywalker and Han Solo,not to mention that,got rest her soul,Carrie Fisher died just after she finished filming for this movie.
So be ready in the 9th film to see her character,Leia Skywalker to die and with her death we can say goodbye to the major characters from the Star Wars movies,except C-3PO,R2-D2 and Chewbacca.
But let's not despair,there's still hope for the new Star Wars characters like Poe Dameron,Finn,BB-8,Rey and Kylo Ren to become the next big Star Wars character,who will become almost as great as the old characters.But that will take a lot of time and it will depend on the directors of the upcoming Star Wars movies.
Overall,I enjoyed watching this movie and I found it as being just a good SF movie and almost a good Star Wars movie. I think that what I didn't liked was the fact that Mark Hamill's characters was undervalue by the director of the movie and i think that Mark Hamill's character deserved more than we've seen of him in these 2 movies:Star Wars The Force Awakens and Star Wars The Last Jedi.
Again,in the future I hope that both the company and the directors of the next Star Wars movies won't repeat this mistake again or they should be ready for what will come next,if they'll do it again.By the way,I think that the only great thing that didn't make this movie to be bad is the great performance that Adam Driver is doing with his character,Kylo Ren.",0.20912433155080212,0.44659090909090904

2. Speaking of Poe.... He's supposed to be the ""Han Solo"" right? Was Han ever that big of a... wad? (I don't know what the language restrictions are here.)
3. We watched Obi-Wan confront his dark side padawan. Watching Luke do it with Ben is not riveting.
4. Finn is a loser of epic proportions. I don't know how they expect a franchise to succeed with him in it. Also don't know why Rose is hated more than that loser.
5. Speaking of Finn and Rose, they wasted time and resources on saving a ship that was destined for destruction and got the resistance killed. Who's writing these stories now? Depressing much?

My problem with The Last Jedi is not in some small details. The biggest problem for me is with the direction the whole saga is heading to. Star Wars is slowly becoming a Christmas movie that parents go and see with their kids. I know it's a money printing machine, but Disney should think twice before the next release... By making it easy-to-understand typical pop-corn movie they are missing the main point of Star Wars. It's a story that must show the battle between good and evil in it's full spectrum. The movie should be darker, more intense, mysterious, philosophical in some sense. If it's easy for a 8 year old to fully understand it, then you are doing something wrong. Making Star Wars too shallow is going to destroy the franchise. By watching it we should feel scared, inspired, losing hope, getting it back. We should go trough different emotions and I mean real, extreme emotions. Even the evil guys are not so evil - this Kylo Ren guy is like some new-age confused punk. Just an example of how shallow the characters and the plot is becoming. Disney, please be brave. Go to the extremes, make us go trough emotional roller-coaster when watching Star Wars .

"As with the Star Trek films JJ. Abrams has a few blind spots amidst all that storytelling genius. And it seems that Rian Johnson shares a couple of them. Result? Action heavy, depth light. They both operate on a formula that says, offer action first, then explain who the characters are later, or at best try to explain them in snappy one-liners. It doesn't always work. It's much better to care about the characters before putting them into danger. It makes the danger real and draws the viewer into the action.

So they collect all the ingredients and blend it all together and make a hamburger out of it for the consumer society. Star Wars wasn't really ment to be a blockbuster movie for merchandise sales. Honestly, it's a bedtime tale for geeks who wish to connect with the world. The magic was never in the Millenium Falcon, the Deathstar, the props or the tools used. The magic was in the story that told tales of good and evil and the wisdom of knowing what they are. It had characters you could relate to and cheer for. Tragedies that ment something because you understood the nature of those it happened to. It was never grandiose, that was just a wallpaper in the background. It was always small, and personal.

"A vicious, cruel deconstruction of the very core of the Star Wars Mythos. Rian Johnson seems to have been hell-bent on destroying everything that I love about Star Wars. This movie is tragically flawed on many counts, an empty copy of Empire Strikes Back, absolutely lazy plot construction, bending the rules of the Star Wars universe to fit his desired narrative rather than crafting a narrative that conforms to 40 years of Star Wars history, and the most gawd-awfully contrived and forced plot twists that they become so repetative that when really good twists show up..my only reaction was.. okay... another twist.. 
But the true crime of this film is its near sadistic treatment of Luke Skywalker, and the Original Trilogy. for 34 years I've waited to see the answer to the question of what happened to Luke after the Battle of Endor. I'd read several EU books which certainly got Luke's character pitch-perfect even if I wasn't always fully enamored with a particular plot.. at least it was Luke.. but with Disney wiping away the EU I was looking forward to seeing my childhood hero facing new challenges.. creating a new and improved Jedi Order, facing down new threats, internal or external.. instead Rian Johnson felt it more appropriate to break Luke. Literally break him. Turns out that after saving his father, bringing balance to the Force and restoring Hope to the Galaxy, Luke's life then became a veritable hell.. leaving him so crushed, disillusioned, consumed by guilt and self-loathing that he exiles himself, cut off from the Force, spending the rest of his life waiting to die while consumed with unimaginable guilt and bitterness. 
Then, if that's not enough, by the time credits roll, RJ has literally wiped away the entire Original Trilogy. Not an exaggeration. Virtually everything that our heroes fought, struggled, sacrificed and persevered for is destroyed.. completely.. and totally..
Rian Johnson's vision of Luke Skywalker is cruel. It is mean. He takes the central tenant of Star Wars, where idealism, perseverance, sacrifice and heroism can win the day against tyranny, that basic idea of staying positive and fighting evil even when the cards are against you, can eventually win the day.. and replaces it with a nihilistic shrug that the struggle against tyranny is destined to fail.. that the good and the moral are destined to be defeated
Lost in all of this are some truly great ideas.. new story fragments which flutter in the shadows are actually quite interesting and compelling.. the confrontation between Rey and Ben are executed in a shockingly clumbsy way, but at their core are actually interesting and engaging.. yet completely lost in the sloppy mess that is the attack on everything I grew up admiring and loving.
Disney, Kathleen Kennedy, and Rian Johnson have succeded in doing what I once thought impossible.. making me not care about the next chapter.. there is literally nothing left for me to care about, or root for.

"STAR WARS IX TLJ REVIEW: 
*WITH SPOILERS*",0.0,0.0
"To begin I was lonely one day and when the age of 32 in 1976 I joined friends from the physics department of Washington University to go see this movie. They insisted I would enjoy the time spent...at this time I had a broadcast pay TV station and obtained 3/4 inch master of the movie. My children now 47 and 50 can recite the entire movie...Now the point of this review...I see many amateur reviewers telling me why this is junk as well as some of the professionals giving it a thumbs down. I really do find it amazing that those reviewing individual movies have missed the point. This is something that was very evident in the first three chapters...But these days because many of the reviewers were either to young or not born yet and missed the beginning of the adventure...This has been a visual novel created for over 40 years..When someone gives criticism, no matter how well intended they are just talking about one chapter of a very long book and have yet been able to view the completed project. The benefit they receive it is visual and they do not have to spend months reading and trying to figure out who did what to whom...To those who say the chapters do not follow the theme I do really wonder if any of them has ever bothered to read a novel... when chapter 3 was released for the most part those who have negative comments seem to have missed the totality of the project.... This has been a 43 year adventure in story telling and if those who judge this series poorly get off your lame rear ends and do it better, yeah those will be some fine productions...heh in closing I recently read another poor review by a young woman of the age of 22 who created an account just to tell us how bad this chapter was, I did find her evaluation amusing. Maybe I just like a good story and enjoy movies and am not an unpaid critic. Do you go to the movies to have an enjoyable time or to sit there taking notes on your 6 inch computer screen annoying those sitting around you, you are worse than a screaming 3 year old in the front row",0.09780864197530868,0.4787191358024691
"I can say , not a bad at all movie, but... as i grew older, became more cynical and start to like sf. more related to our planet than in a galaxy far, far, away... 
Valerian and Star Trek , are in my view relating more to me than some flying penguins and some ugly nuns from a Jedi's Scottish island. 
 Valerian with its new and fresh faces, was way better done , more so when we know now that the greek boy stole many ideas from them and John Carter ...Also, Star Trek does change the style and substance from one movie and tv show to another, so , it's also fresh and challenging . 
That being said ( written...) i enjoyed the acting of these new actors ; like the old ones, i believe we will see more of them... 
The CGI where as i expected, also the direction was really good. 
I gave only eight stars, maybe for the reason of tiredness. 
It's time to finish it and start something else. 
Maybe a challenge to humanity while emigrating to other stars ? I mean something serious , scientific, and with a big budget .",0.15728535353535358,0.5512752525252526

Ah, good things... great effects! Hmm. I'm sure I'll figure out something else and fill it in later... Ha, just kidding! 
I don't think I've ever been so frustrated with a movie. I wanted to find out more about how they try to resolve their problems, about the force, Sith lords, etc. Every single one of my questions was answered with a gun/lightsaber fight. Hey, tell me more about the Sith lords! PEW-PEW! Aaah, I understand. Thank you.
I have no new knowledge about their world, except that the space cows have green milk. WELL, THANK YOU! HOW COULD I HAVE LIVED WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION! STAR WARS IS NOW OVER! I HAVE LEARNED EVERYTHING I WANTED TO KNOW! 
And killing off all the characters just so you could continue making 500 new movies with new jedi. Cha-ching! Right? You've destroyed so many superheros and movies. YOU COULD HAVE LET THIS ONE SLIDE AND MAKE US A GREAT MOVIE! Evil creatures!
And come on! Luke wanting to destroyed jedi because he thinks they shouldn't exist anymore? Suddenly, after existing for thousands of years, Luke gets to decide the fate of the jedi. SO, being the last jedi suddenly grants you the wisdom that none had had before. Pff. Producers and writers, HAVE YOU EVER WATCHED STAR WARS?! Luke would never do that! Never! 
And Luke's hologram? I don't even want to get into that... I will carefully step over that and move on...
And great job on the Ray's training! She had climbed so many hills! She is definitely ready to use the force! And her trainer - the rock. Best jedi ever!",0.24083563311688308,0.5287676767676767

"Wow! I remember walking out of the theater thinking ""That movie took everything I thought was going to happen, and gave me something even better""! Here's what I expected to go down.
I did expect that Luke would be a grouchy old man at first but would soon come around to help the resistance. I loved this and thought it added even more to his character. His thoughts of attacking Kylo I found even better. Luke always had a connection to the Dark Side. Especially shown when he battled Vader on the Death Star. However, just when he was about to go too far, he realized that what he was doing was wrong. I found this moment reflective of that scene and showed a more human side of Luke.
The throne room scene caught me completely off guard however. I expected that kylo would hold off Snoke so he and Rey could escape and regroup with the resistance, leaving Snoke tone the leading villain of Episode IX. When Kylo ignited the lightsaber and KILLED Snoke my jaw hit the floor. The film lets us believe there is hope for him yet, until he says, Rey, Join me and we can rule the galaxy. It's heartbreaking but it just seems right.
Luke's death I found very appropriate. He went out saving the cause he believed in and the final scene before he fades away is beautiful. He looks out into the sunset as the wind blows through his face, calling back to where he was in Episode IV, showing how much he has grown since his youth on Tatooine. It's a beautiful scene that I think many overlook.
The hate on this movie is absolutely ridiculous. Rian Johnson made a fantastic movie that easily rivals the Force Awakens and opens the door for so many possibilities. The Canto Bite sequence, while it slows down the movie, is nowhere near as boring as the Senate scenes in Phantom Menace. For this film to have only 7.2 stars on this site is ridiculous and shows how butthurt fanboys can get.",0.12336860670194004,0.6091710758377424

I think another problem with people already creating a story in their heads was that it made them biased, and they refused to see the movie for what it was, but instead point out all the tiny little detaails that people disagreed with. People were not regarding the movie as a normal film, but instead a ""Star Wars movie"". They were not open to seeInch new ideas play out on the screen, and instead, let their bias ruin a perfectly fun film for them. Also, people who watched the original Star Wars films as children watched them through pure, innocent eyes, looking only for wonder and fun.

"Star Wars VIII: The Last Jedi is the second installment in the third trilogy of nine mainstream Star Wars movies that started back in 1977 with Episode IV: A New Hope. Back then, there was no such thing as CGI or 3D. So filmmaker George Lucas invented technology to make his vision come to life. His films were groundbreaking and laid the foundation for some of the greatest advances in cinema. Episodes IV, V, and VI were movies that changed how movies are made. They were ahead of their time and still hold up forty years later. In 1999, Lucas went back to tell us how it all began with Episode I: The Phantom Menace. CGI technology had come a long way, but it wasn't perfect. For his original trilogy, Lucas invented new technology to create what he saw in his mind. He received heavy criticism for Episode I as he seemed instead to settle for what technology was available at the time. He listened to the critics and scaled it back for Episode III, but it still lacked what made the original trilogy so special. In 2015, JJ Abrams and Disney joined forces (pun intended) to release Episode VII: The Force Awakens and it was the perfect blend of technology versus actual characters and actual props. Episode VIII continues Rey's (Daisy Ridley) Jedi training with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).",0.20590318772136953,0.36578118850846125

Oke so to be clear i think this was already the case with the other 2 movies before this one but it has to be told. The prequels were at least original in contrast to the first star wars movies. But this is just making more money out of those frist movies by putting old ideas in a new coating. It looks amazing thats true. But it is so predictive that i could have left after 20 minutes and regret nothing. If it wasn't for the 4dx i choose i would have been really disapointed. I will never go to a star wars movie again before there are enough reviews that tell me that it is new and fresh because at this moment it is a wast of money. Maybe it is Disney that does not dair to change it too much because they only care about the money and don't think about making a good original movie.,0.20514354066985643,0.4816188197767146

"The new trilogy is a departure from Star Wars in many ways.
But to say it is bad...?
No, it is not bad. I have seen all movies and have appreciated them all.
There are bad things in TLJ, sure, but there are also good things.
I have read several die hard fans review, and I will say a few things about the most disliked issues:
1. Too little character development. Partly true, there is no classic development, with defining moments for all characters - all action paused for the audience to understand the moment. But the characters grow in real time. There are many new characters, which is normal if you think of it, and the movie cannot be paused for all of them.
2. Bad subplot with the codebreaker. Well, shockingly as a fan of SW, I enjoyed it. Always knowing what happens, it kills the suspense.
3. Too many build ups not used. Yes, they were many. But I fell for all of them. So in my opinion, they were well used. Not being sure what comes next, I would say it was refreshing for the SW franchise. It is what was missing in parts 1-3, where we knew how they end. 
4. Snoke died too soon. Arguable I would say. This levels the field and allows a range of endings. And it is in the spirit of the entire series. Both Jedi and Sith were defeated by their arrogance. In a way, it made a lot of sense. As we did not think it was possible, because Kylo Ren was young, and inexperienced, probably the sith thought that as well. 
5. Lack of real romance between characters. Sort of. And is love always shared? Finn has 2 ongoing possible relations. I would say both are not for him. He cares about Rey, but their relationship is kinda platonic. Same with the other girl (don't remember the name). My bet is he did not meet his partner yet. Rey fits well with Kylo Ren. Not sure that they don't end up together in the end. But the movie was very fast, so it is true, you can't build romance @ that pace.
6. The First Order not making a small jump to catch the rebels. Yes, you have that right. I agree. Did not think of it myself, so I enjoyed the movie.
7. Luke's development. How is his withdrawal ruining the series? Why do you expect a man with all the answers? You assume that wisdom implies action? Sometimes, wisdom implies inaction. And his emotional scar was indeed deep. To train his sister's kid and be so close to killing him? That was a difficult decision to take and such a thing can break a man. In a way he ran from the consequences of his actions. He knows he is to blame, and that fixing things can lead to making them worse. In a way, he does fix them, as the force comes to visit him, and reactivates him. He was once again needed. 
I could go on, but I will stop by saying this:
A departure from known paths is a risk, but so is staying in the same mindset. For me, the most difficult thing to accept was the new setup with a First Order so strong. It really did set a dark tone to the new trilogy, and I disliked that it made the efforts of all characters in the original trilogy to be for nothing.
But as I rewatched episode 7 now, without watching episode 6 before, I think that judging it on its own, it was not bad. So episode 8 was also not bad. A bigger departure from Star Wars than all other episodes, but in my opinion, something the series really needed.",0.08749278499278497,0.5280274797666101
"It looks like Hollywood is no longer betting on anything unlikely and the big master Disney that now seems to run the industry of entertainment is turning conservative even more. Star Wars Episode VIII is the latest quintessence of this new order. Where there is just a small room getting thinner for risk. Along with all Marvel movies, sequels, prequels, spin-offs... a new trilogy (the third one) of the once rule breaker George Lucas universe was set to be produced. The formula works, a massive phenomenom with such a fandom behind would bring thousands to the movies. The nostalgia invades the room and creates new generations of followers. Episode VII, released on 2016, was such a shameless self-copy that I wonder if it is an unofficial remake. This time, we may be talking about a different kind of drama, the drama I call 'none'. Someone asked me about what this new movie was about, expecting a long and developed answer, and I could not give more than a five second response. The movie is, get ready, about the rebels escaping from the First Order (once known as 'The Empire'), that is it. Two hours of just the same with a different name, a plot so simple and so predictable that it even gets boring. The lighting and bombing space spectacle is guaranteed, that is for sure. Mark Hammil and Carrie Fisher (rest in peace), were brought back to life from who knows where to play Luke and Leia, and looking at their interpretations, they should have remained as legends for the sake of Star Wars epic, but hey Disney, that would bring more people in, right? The old background drama feeling was far gone with Episode VII, but this one has spit on its grave with cheap jokes that turn The First Order into a bunch of clowns. Han Solo, we miss you so much. Overall, I have to be honest, I enjoyed the movie because I include myself in the fandom, but it is sad how Disney is shrinking the drama and turning Star Wars into a light and fireworks performance, starring the Rebels and the First Order.",0.10193259121830552,0.5053554249982821

Rather than drawing the same plot structure, per se, he looked to Empire for inspiration tonally. He needed to write a story that brings these characters to the edge of what they think is possible, including those still alive in the original cast.
Within the familiarity of the archetypes, comes a lot of quirkiness. There are the porgs. There are all the other fun creatures that beautifully inhabit the various planets where battles ensue. There's the witty banter as people young characters try to be heroic, with mixed results.

"When I walked out the movie theater with my friends and we discussed what we thought of the movie the first words out of my mouth were ""I thought I bought a ticket to a Star Wars movie, but halfway through it turned into a Harry Potter movie"". The scene I'm referring to where the franchise really ""jumped the shark"" is where Rose and Finn break those animals out of the stables and ride them out trying to escape. And that to me is the big disconnect with this film. On a very surface level, there is no denying that it is an entertaining film. Big space battles that blow stuff up? Check. Lots of laser blasts from one batch of toys fighting another batch of toys? Check. Great sound and special effects? Yeah this movie had it as well. But at the end of the day, the plot, acting, and everything else about this movie was something I would have expected from a Harry Potter movie not a Star Wars movie. I'm not saying that as a slight to the Harry Potter films at all (I enjoyed them), but that's not what I want from a Star Wars movie. But sadly this is what we should all expect from Disney's future direction for this franchise. And as long as these films make oodles of money at the box office (which they will since they are Star Wars after all), Disney will feel justified in making these decisions. I'm just incredibly sad because I thought this franchise was going in a much better direction a la Rogue One (an incredible Star Wars film in my opinion).

"I can't fathom these people who cant appreciate a movie just because it didn't cater to their wishes. Leia did not fly. She used the force to briefly keep herself alive in the vacuum and used the ship like a tether to pull herself toward it; not flying. She has 30 years to master or at least learn more on how to use her powers.
 As for Luke, just because we never saw a Force user use that power doesn't mean it isn't possible to project an image of yourself over several light years. Who knows what he has dealt with until the scene with Ben. He might have seen nosalvation and had a moment of weakness. He's not a God and not infallible. He still wasn't going to kill him. 
 The bombs dropped in the dreadnaught could-have contained incredibly destructive powers. We saw in ANH how an X-Wing can avoid the numerous turrets and laser batteries to attack a larger ship. 
 Yes the casino segment was stupid and boring and why didn't one of the First Order shops just jump to light speed in front of the Rebel ship? We were also cheated with Snoke's background ( for now ). The movie wasn't perfect but incredibly entertaining and certainly a Star Wars movie all the way. 
 Grow up people. The movie wasn't made for you specifically. As a pure SW fan for 40 years; I loved it and do did my family. I have seen each movie dozens of times and all the animated shows.

"What's bunch of nerd whiners!!! Fantastic movie with great action set pieces!!!
 Leia did not fly children. She used the force to pull herself toward the ship and survive the rigors of space for a few minutes. Luke projects an illusion of himself to fool Kylo. The ultranerds would have you believe that this is impossible because we've never seen it before. This is a made up power so now we know they have this ability. See.....logic and immobile sense. Also Leia supposedly NEVER showed those powers. Stupid nerds; that was 30 years ago. Who knows what she's learned and how powerful she's become. 
 So the dreadnaught gets destroyed by oh powerfully constructed bombs. We've no idea what they're made of. You but the logic of adamantium don't you?
 Luke who for all we know changed tremendously in those 20 years. So he had a weak moment because he felt the darkness in Kylo ( much improved performance BTW ). He still wasn't going to through with it. Rey's parents turned out to worthless nobodies. Great twist. Vader's Mother has no powers either. So don't go there.
 No light saber battle. So what? A fantastic battle with (one can assume ) extraordinarily trained guards. Rey saved Rylo but he dispatched most of them. Snoke is his arrogance and self assurance didn't sense the lightsaber about to kill him. I could go on forever. Now there were some bad parts. The whole Casino subplot sucked. They should have let Finn die. Phasma was again a nonentity and Gleeson as Hux was way over the top. Leia in space was a stretch but these are minor quibbles.

Here I could see a lot of things happening, but 80% of that never really made any sense. It's like watching a bunch of ads in a chaotic order. This also means that there were enjoyable 3-4 minutes if I could completely ignore what happened before and after that little window. So I can say I generally liked 30 mins of the movie in appr. 10 little sections, where the in-between has been filled with various nonsense (lousy space battles, bad acting, mindless action, fun-killing stupid jokes, ok, the later could be enjoyable for someone below 12).
Finn and Rose. Why??? Stupid story, bad characters, lost potential. Their travel to the ""Casino World"" totally lame.
Poe? Not bad, if he got shot to the head after the first 10 mins because he disobeyed orders. Or just get thrown out through an airlock by some comrades. Sadly he survived and kept doing things, which resulted in the further loss of rebel forces. 
Wait... Rebel Forces? Again? Didn't they defeat the Galactic Empire and founded the New Galactic Republic? Or what has happened? Any tiny bit of info? Please? ...

"Star Wars used to be an epic saga built up from an almost Jungian archetypical level. After all, Lucas was heavily influenced by ancient mythology, by Joseph Campbell's classic on mythological archetypes and other spiritual influences. A lot can be said about the second trilogy, but even those still retained some of that magic, albeit hidden behind all the CGI and the end-of-the-republic politics.
Not anymore with the new films, or almost not anymore. Since Lucas sold SW to -I thought- Disney, it's become a franchise. Other people -no doubt not as heavily immersed in ancient mythology as was Lucas- now write and direct the saga.
This becomes very apparent with the latest films, Rogue One, The Force Awakens, and The Last Jedi. 
It's not that it's bad, it's just not how Star Wars used to be. There is almost no spiritual and archetypical element anymore, or what is left has been reduced to -admittedly often great- grandstanding about the 'power' of the Force and of lightsabers. But beneath that, it's now become a series endlessly rehearsing staple SW ingredients but then without the deeper spirituality as its genuine base. 
Without this, SW is little more than action packed (American) Science Fiction: it's a profane money-maker using all the old elements without truly feeling through the, so of course the old sacred vibe is gone.

"I'm 39. I grew up watching Star Wars on UK Christmas TV, and later on VHS. I wouldn't say they were the be-all-and-end-all for me (like some of my childhood friends), but of course they were a real treat and gave me a taste of a future love; sci-fi. This film transported me right back there. I loved it. There's so much goodness packed into it, from the brilliantly dark characters, to the genuinely funny comedy, awesome fight scenes, vibrant colours and lovely cinematography from faces to landscapes. It really is a triumph and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Some of the close up shots somehow feel so 80s, and nice touches like focusing on feet movement etc like old samurai flicks. The story had me engrossed throughout. The whole cast did a stellar job. Adam Driver I was unsure of having only seen him in Logan Lucky, but he did a top job. Yes.. more like this please! Don't let the 1-3 star reviews from the ""heartbroken"" and easily offended take away the awesomeness of this gem. ",0.3080853174603175,0.5191964285714287
"The other reviews on this page really do seem dramatic, with such low ratings and claims like ""Disney ruined my childhood"" and whatnot. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but it seems many reviewers are focusing only on the bad of the movie. So in this brief review, I will discuss in detail a few elements I liked and some that I didn't.
What I liked:
The direction in this film is wonderful. Ryan Johnson does absolutely everything that he can to make the script come to life, and I feel that he really utilizes his resources well. Every shot feels important and vibrant. While the rest of the Star Wars movies are primarily story based with generic direction, this was the first in the series that had a beautiful cinematic aspect to it. Colorful images and beautiful landscapes kept my eyes entertained and took me back to the wonder that I first experienced when watching Star Wars in my childhood.
Rey is wonderful in this film. Daisy Ridley is the most beautiful woman on the planet, I'm convinced, and MAN can she act! In this installment, we see a lot more of her struggle with the dark side of the force and her character flaw is put into full light; she is naive. Ridley pulls off this character, who is barely learning that everything she thought she knew needs to be questioned, and it's absolutely enthralling to watch. For those who felt she was a ""Mary-Sue"" after TFA, Disney heard your criticisms. There were points where it genuinely felt like she would give in to the temptation to join the dark side, and you could really feel the confusion along with her. The narrative of Rey is by far the best thing about this film.
Aside from that, as always, the saga continues to handle death perfectly. Each death of major characters throughout the series has been hard hitting, and the deaths of Luke Skywalker and Supreme Leader Snoke absolutely lived up to the standard. Very intense and emotional deaths, respectively.
There are some weird things in this installment, and some of those things really work. For instance, the use of flashbacks is not cheesy or gimmicky at all, which is what I expected when I heard this device would be used. Rather, they are packed with intensity, and it's actually a great storytelling device that's used properly here.
Ultimately, we see characters rise into who they really are. Luke finishes his life a good guy, like he's always been (though he lost himself). Rey ultimately chooses the light side, showing her true colors. Kylo Ren shapes into the full evil that he is, proving that he cannot be turned anymore. Finn overcomes his cowardice. And so on. There is very little wrong with the character development or their portrayals.",0.2021384803921568,0.5914215686274509
"You don't go to a Star Wars movie to see a 20 minute blaster battle... the last 4 minutes of rogue one, EPIC!.. Light Sabers for Christ's sake!!! When Luke called it a 'laser sword' I about drove to Disney to burn it to the ground. Stop overthinking this basic kid emotion with replacing it with PC casting, a villain who I think I could kick his ass with a cane, and ridiculous cameos from stars who want a paycheck. You are RUINING STAR WARS FOREVER!.",0.09791666666666668,0.4583333333333333
"This movie is seriously over hated. I understand people's complaints but to my eyes they're mostly contrived in my eyes. I agree the casino planet was wack but the thing is the film is 150 minutes an it takes up only 20 minutes while other plot lines are happening. The first half of the movie dedicates most of it's time to Rey and Luke which is the best part of the movie to me. A lot of people despise the movie's portrayal of Luke. I love him in this film. He's a truly broken person. People hate that he tried to kill Ben but here's the thing: Luke is not a perfect person. He never has been. He almost killed Vader, HIS OWN FATHER in ROTJ, even when he saw good in him. Now imagine what he would do if he saw evil in someone. Back to Rey and Luke. The force scenes are beautifully cut. This movie's visuals are gorgeous, and I love Luke's redemption arc, it's brilliant paced and executed. The Poe and Holdo plot line is decent but bot outstanding like the Luke stuff. Holdo is an iffy character and people hate her cause she didn't share the plan, but it's pretty obvious she didn't tell cause Poe just caused most of their fleet to die. Makes sense why she wouldn't trust him. Later when Rey goes to confront Ben, it is built up greatly with all the conversations they share in the first act. People hate that Snoke is killed without any explanation to who he is but don't complain that until the prequels the emperor was killed without any explanation of who he is, so it's kinda hypocritical. Why can't we just say he's an ancient powerful Sith Lord? His death shocked me and got me hyped for the rest of the movie. The throne room fight is neat. The ramming scene is beautiful and makes sense in the universe cause even in the first SW movie ever we're told it's dangerous. The idea of admiral Ackbar doing it is stupid. The Salt planet battle is cool and Luke's final confrontation is very powerful, and I love his death scene. It uses the force theme beautifully, starting his story and ending it with that beautiful score is great. Overall, a great film with great themes and ideas, not perfect but got me excited for Episode 9, too bad that movie sucked.",0.09446540880503143,0.6465408805031445
"For me however it worked on all cylinders. It's fast, fun, flashy, beautifully directed (some great wide shots), great acting (Mark Hamill is amazing), John Williams is on point, it dives deeper into the force, taking many risks all while keeping quiet on Rey's lineage to keep us guessing until the third installment or maybe never. I still don't trust Kylo when he said what he said about Rey's parents, I think he'd say anything to get Rey to join him.
 This film played with ideas that haven't yet been seen in other Star Wars films and I believe that's what the majority disliked about it. Myself and still many others enjoyed the change in plot formula instead of retreading old ground. No it's not perfect like anything else, but it works. 
A familiar face pops it to teach Luke about failure. The failure he speaks of apparently ""ruined"" a lot of fans childhoods. Some will accept this and some won't, there's no right or wrong answer but I do believe Luke is human like the rest of us and makes mistakes. Similar to the mistake he made when Vader spoke of his sister and how Vader wanted to turn her to the dark side. As we know Luke didn't like that and out came some anger filled aggression against his father cutting off his hand and besting him to the ground almost killing him. So in my mind Luke has those tendencies and what he almost did to Kylo to save the greater good didn't bother me but like I said everyone's different. 
TLJ has more to say than previous SW films. It dabbled in Hope again a couple times and that's okay, that's what these movies are about...ragtag teams joining forces and believing/hoping they'll be able to defeat what lies ahead of them. In the same vein the last scene of this film was unexpected but very welcomed. I Hope the next episode is as good as this one.",0.12458471760797339,0.48086932447397573
BOOOOO it would have been empire with JJ but i would have perfect it that way,1.0,1.0
"This is the first time I have written a review but the film was so bad that it has forced me total up 'pen to paper'.
I am long time SW fan- I saw Ep 4 in 1977 as a six year old with my mum. I have loved- lived and breathed SW all my life. I enjoyed the prequels as they showed the slow corruption and undermining of the noble Jedi by the Sith and gave a great rounding out to Palpatine, Yoda, Obi-Wan and Anakin.
I thought TFA was OK but played fast and loose with the established order of the SW universe. I thought killing off Han without the opportunity of the three original heroes to share one last scene together was a travesty. I thought Rey was Ok, but never understood Finn's motivation for turning so quickly against his former friends. Phasma, a junior level officer- why does she have her own armour? Why is she singled out as being special? Her betrayal of the FO in TFA made no sense at all. The Resistance- what is that? How can the ruling power in the universe be the 'Resistance'- it made no sense. The Resistance also felt very unmilitary- compare that to the Rogue One and the Rebellion in Eps 4-6; it feels, looks and conducts itself like a military. Here in TFA, there seems to be no structure and everyone can speak up and contradict orders. The new characters are not likeable and have no gravitas. General Hux is too young and over the top in a moustache twirling manner- he scares nobody and is a joke.
Soo it was with a degree of trepidation that I attended TLJ- it could hardly be worse that TFA could it? Well it was and by a long way. Many of the other posters here have recounted all the problems- the misplaced humour, the illogical plot, the stupidity of the entire middle act on the casino planet, the sudden Force powers of Leia to survive space, the ability of a pipe cleaner (Rose) and a stormtrooper (Finn) to be able to pilot ancient aircraft and most of all the absolute betrayal of perhaps the greatest Jedi of all time, Luke Skywalker.
To think that George Lucas personally trusted and selected Kennedy to continue with his legacy. She has spat on it and with the selection of minnows such as Abrams and Johnson to play in his universe, has trashed his creation.

"Star Wars The Last Jedi is one of those movies that you wait with animosity that is epic and ends up leaving you with that emptiness that I miss something that never came, the film has a luxury casting, Daisy Ridley as King, her performance is incredible, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren at the end of the characters has a clear definition of what he wants to do with him, Oscar Isaac as Poe and John Boyega as Finn is better noted his place as characters in this film, Mark Hamill is certainly a great actor and sad that they want to pigeonhole it on just this character, as Luke presents a rather interesting side of the Jedi side and Carrie Fisher (peacefully rest) does an excellent role, all this great cast and still does not have a plot solid enough to be epic and this leads to a problem, the same problem that is noted in thor ragnarok, going from a moment that was epic, to one that they want to be fun and I do not think it's a problem of the director Rian Johnson who in looper showed that ue has talent to tell a story with incredible details and is present in every visual detail of the film you can tell that he knows this world of star wars, has sequences that keep you entertained, the soundtrack where John Williams is self-homage is incredible, but no more that, there is no that makes star wars love us so much, it is a film for fun and the option to see the weekend and the following week, it is not totally bad, but if you are a fan of star wars maybe you leave somewhat disillusioned, in conclusion the film sins of trying to be like the empire strikes back and ends up being like the return of the jedi",0.2775862068965517,0.43591954022988494

New characters they put in, without propper development, fantasy film elements - like in ""Harry Potter"" make it seem like a childrens movie.

"When I was in the cinema getting ready to see this movie, I was worried because I've never seen a movie get so much negative backlash of a movie in a while so I was worried but I was genuinely satisfied with it. While it doesn't have problems, it's mostly a good Star Wars movie that is mostly good rather than the polar opposite. To start off with the goods, shall we? The score is incredible which is the standard for these movies but it's still brilliant which is definitely applied to 'The Battle Of Crait' which as IHE said juggles around many themes which I highly appreciate. The cgi is also fantastic which again, may be the standard for these types of movies but it's great so who cares, man? The acting is superb with Mark Hamill's triumphant return to the role of Luke Skywalker which is one of the best things about this movie, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega have totally outdone themselves this time by doing even better than there superb performances in The Force Awakens and Kylo Ren being played masterfully by Adam Driver one of my personal favourite actors at the moment who plays probably the most interesting thing in the franchise at the moment. Another thing I love is the way the film separates our heroes and villains by putting them in separate situations which lets you understand where each character is getting at and what they want. The action, while being massively helped by the use of cgi, is very exciting and gripping which is yet again, the norm for these but they are still very good. The cinematography is also fantastic as always and the way the two big plot points merge together at the end in the big battle of Crait is very admirable. Lastly and probably most importantly, I appreciate how Rian Johnson slightly changes the norm of these movies by changing usual plans of past heroes and putting them in that situation and it is usually executed vey well. However, all of this doesn't mean that I think this movie is a ten out of ten masterpiece as there are problems which I am going to now point out. The humour is decent at best and while it does have its moments, it mostly didn't really work for me. The character of Rose is a very polarising character which I can definitely get behind as she wasn't necessarily bad but certainly not good either as I never once thought 'Oh yeah, she's the new gold standard for a Star Wars character!' because she kind of just appears quite early on and we never get a chance to sympathise with her. While those two problems stick out to me a lot, I can't help but admit that I really am a fan of this movie and while it's not anything that special as while Johnson could of gone further with the innovation, he is definitely on the right track. It's a shame that it's not looking like he isn't going to direct the next one, hopefully he's given more chances at massive budget movies because he really is a talented director who deserves even more time to create movies.",0.25694911895616124,0.5068430278641547

Not to say it was all unfulfilling but a lot simply didn't pay off with as much impact as the characters deserved. (Luke's fate being chief among them) Overall, Luke's arc finished with him appearing to be a whinny crybaby and his actions since Kylo's defection seemed overblown and snivel-like in nature.

I won't blame Disney, as these days, it's going to be next to impossible-unless you're Marvel, who seem to be the the only one's who can get it right-to please everyone.

It's funny that one of Rian Johnson themes is failure because he completely and utterly failed to convince me of them. This is how I felt about movie, it was a good idea but execution was extremely lacking and downright atrocious at times. Unnecessary humor, every joke felt forced, it's like Disney thought we could not handle the serious moments. I felt confused and empty when I left the theater, I was literally speechless but in a very negative way. Felt the explanations for why these things were happening was extremely elementary and not well thought out at all, I can live with small plot holes but major ones just can't be overlooked. Rian Johnson was clearly not the right guy for the job, script and pacing were issues though out the film. Rey is still a Mary Sue to me and this is not a criticism of a lead female character but a reflection of poorly written ones. So I really should say that Rian Johnson is the real Gary Sue in all this because he is the one to blame for allowing this vitriol to be put on screen. ***Spolier***I didn't mind that Luke died and that was a pretty good parlor trick he did but it's just another example of a good idea but flawed execution. I knew it wasn't really Luke on the salt planet, he looked completely different from the rest of the film, I call it Luke's Just for Men moment. Hint Rian Johnson you change one or two small things and not three or four major things if you want to convince me of your deception.

""But why are you rating this movie 9/10 stars?"" you might be asking me. 
The movie took some time for me to digest. It wasn't until I understood the Motif of the movie that I started to understand why Rian Johnson went the direction he did. As Kylo Ren/Ben Solo says twice in the film: ""Let the past die, Kill it if you have to.""
This is the theme of all the decisions made in and for this movie.
In the movie, we see several characters from the original trilogy die. This is one of the more literal examples of this theme. But the theme also describes the direction of the movie itself. Rian made changes to the traditional Star Wars formula. For example:
-This is the first main series movie that does not feature a lightsaber duel.

"I just finished watching this movie a second time and find it to be one of the best in the saga. After two years of fans taking to the internet, complaining about the tired formula that The Force Awakens had ripped from previous entries, Rian Johnson inflates the new trilogy with a breath of fresh air that is refreshing to say the least. Although it isn't conventional, The Last Jedi is undoubtedly a Star Wars movie, with a few minute flaws that have been blown out of proportion. Yes, Canto Bite was difficult to watch, but upon my second viewing, was begun and ended much quicker then I had remembered, and much to my surprise, was a much more bearable once I knew it was coming. Again, a bit jarring, but I feel as though there is so much I love about this film. The moments between Rey and Luke always kept me intrigued and on the edge of my seat. Luke ad changed so much since the original trilogy, but rightfully so. His personalty traits ran more akin to Yoda on Dagobah after facing the fall of the Old republic. Luke is clearly damaged, and perhaps a bit misguided. It has been thirty years. He's not going to be the same person we know and love. The death of Snoke was tense and satisfying. I'm appalled at the reaction towards it. In my opinion, Snoke was the least memorable part of The Force Awakens. He was always a plot point, and the shock factor of killing him off so soon is incredible, and the plot device is putting a new twist on Kylo Ren's character that I'm very excited about. Honestly, it's difficult for me to defend Snoke because I had a hard time caring about his character and back story. The internet theories were just getting to be too much that the truth would've been disappointing anyways, so Rian Johnson just killed him, and it took balls. The climax is also one of the most jaw dropping, spectacular twists since 'I'm you're father' and it gave me chills on both viewings. Overall, The Last Jedi is one of the best chapters in the Star Wars saga in my opinion, and certainly surpasses The Force Awakens and Rogue One.",0.12306793585202674,0.46165141676505317

"Going into this movie I had one wish, I thought ""Please don't be a repeat of Episode V."" The Force Awakens mirrored A New Hope, and while it made sense to reassure returning fans, and give any new fans a fantastic story to start with, it disappointed me a little how safe they played it. The Last Jedi took all the expectations I had going in and threw them out the window.
 Now most people are upset by this. They wanted all their questions answered more or less the way they were expecting. I feel the exact opposite, and yes I am a long time fan of ALL the previous movies, not that I should have to qualify my opinion with that. This movie was exhilarating. I can't remember the last time I turned to my friend in the theater with my mouth open in amazement because I'm so shocked about what just happened. It made the movie exciting, and the stakes higher, since I no longer felt completely sure about anything that was going to happen. Movies are ultimately just entertainment, and it certainly succeeded in that regard.
 The visuals, acting, spectacle, sound, etc was phenomenal. The entire scene in Snoke's throne room made me want to cheer.

Well, I think that I don't bother too much in analyzing script. While the movie stays in reasonable limits (like much of Vin Diesel films don't do), I just go and see it. Well, this was the case. The actors are really fine, technical aspects are an orgasm and, like I said before, most of the time I was thinking... Will it be a happy ending? Or at least something near it?

"First of all, since I had such a low expectation going into the movie, I was not as disappointed as I'd expected. I thought the previous installment (Episode VII, not the Rogue One) was bad, and that this would be even worse. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't, but it just didn't feel so. Not that it was awesome or anything, it was just OK to watch. At least I did not roll my eyes so very much like I did two years ago.
 
Having said that, as The Force Awakens was a collage of all the previous movies, this was mainly a collage of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Nothing original was in there. Just some old gimmicks, familiar cliches, and all-around action. Despite all these, there were some spectacular scenes in there, mostly thanks to the CGI team and in some instances to the cinematographer(s). Otherwise, it was Episode V + Episode VI + CGI = Episode VIII - Originality + Plot Holes. And if you can get past all those magnificent CGI scenes, you could also see the shallow points in the plot. By that, I do not mean the use of excessive humor and many jokes in such an epic sci-fi drama. Contrary to many reviewers here, I was not that much offended by the humor since it was not delivered by the main characters (as was the case, for instance, in Thor: Ragnarok) but rather, by some of the side characters and accessories*.",0.10099747474747478,0.46356060606060606

I was intrigued to watch this ""disappointing"" film. Guess what? It was amazing. Not perfect, but creative, complex and yes fun! What Rian Johnson added to the Star Wars universe was a much needed jolt of realism and complexity. I think the major reason most people dislike it is that they don't like to feel uncomfortable or unsure, but they are willing to watch the completely unoriginal ""The Force Awakens"" and left satisfied?

"There is no doubt that fans will recognise and relate to the Star Wars universe and be happy about it. However, I find the story confusing. The story lines of all the Star Wars movies up to now have been crystal clear and pertinent to the title. E.g. A new hope - the empire has taken over and the rebellion gets organised. This one does not seem to have sense of purpose. Is it the end of the Jedi? Is it the begging of a new Jedi order? The contours of the new order are fuzzy and so are that of the rebellion. 
Don't get me wrong, there a many positives for which I have given a rating of 7. But sometimes you get a feeling that the motive of was essentially commercial - to create a transition from the old to the new and lay the foundations for a new number Star Wars movies including television series and spinoffs. In the process they forget to tell a good, old fashioned story - which I believe film making should be about. 
I also do not understand the need to have broken the flow of everything that was set in motion in the episode, The Force Awakens. It feels like the producers, directors and script writers have had a good fight about where to take the franchise thereon. 
The promise of a new lead that takes over Luke in the first series and Anakin in the second is not fulfilled. Rey, that was such a powerful character in The Force Awakens seems to have lost her clout. The attempt to pick it up in the end, to me was not enough. The most exciting question after The Force Awakens was her origins which had a very lukewarm treatment in the sequel. The love plot fizzles out. We see no remnants of the Republic that was supposed to have flourished after return of the Jedi. The training of Rey is nothing compared to that of Luke in the Empire strikes back and lacks the many spiritual layers of Yoda and his Dagobah refuge. 
On top of that, The Last Jedi introduces so many elements that do not deliver, the code breaker, the dark level of Luke's planet, the vestige of the Jedi heritage, Snoke's death, the planet promised to be special where the rebellion goes to take refuge. 
On a positive note, it is the Star Wars universe all right and leaves a good aftertaste for a fans like myself. But a feeling of incompleteness and a flawed attempt to make a film with the DNA of the Empire strikes back just as The Force Awakens was made of the DNA of a New Hope. 
Let's say I found the film good in form but lacking in substance. I would agree with the critic who said ""I am not sure if I saw a good film or a bad one.""",0.17442443919716646,0.4660599501508594

"After The Force Awakens, I pretty much take it as just another movie that uses the title and story background of Star Wars. As the descend of Han Solo in the previous one and the glimp of Skywalker at the end of the movie, I was expecting Luke would play a role more or less like Yoda in the orginal series. I should claim that the difference between the movie and what I expected is not the reason for this score. 
As we all know it is not easy to stick with science as movie serves another purpose. However, there are some amazing scenes in this movie that simply blowed my mind into the galexy. At least on IMDB, it is not in the category of Scifi. Despite the acts that main characters survived all those explotion, huamn can survive exposing to the spacing without helmet and suit (especially Leia)?
As well, the story was full with chaos and confusions that lead the audience to nowhere. The conflict of Luke, the conflict of Rey, too overwhelming in 2h30min.
One thing appreciated is at least the movie did not bore me during the whole time. Only left a mess mind of no impression of the story.",0.07708333333333332,0.4891071428571429

The Last Jedi picks up where the last film left off and solidifies what is going to be the tone and structure of the new trilogy. Homage is a strong word but the Last Jedi continues to use the foundation of previous trilogies, but where Force Awakens used the original trilogy to get off the ground, Last Jedi uses it to elevate the story and themes. This was the most thematically heavy of the Star Wars movies, spirituality, theology and repetition build into a story that resembles archetypical mythology and legend. George Lucas said of Star Wars that it is an epic poem and each verse rhymes, this is true of the last Jedi. Each callback has payoff and does something to enhance the story. If I were to have one critique it would be of the pacing. Between some of the best action sequences in the Star Wars saga the parts in between can suffer from a lack of momentum.

"Yes, I get it. The Last Jedi is not perfect. It has cheesy moments like the Leia poppins scene, Luke milking a space cow(TMI!), Rose's cheesy line about ""saving who we love instead of fighting who we hate"", The Maz Kanata hologram, Snoke killed off ""too early, etc..... But these are not the problems in the grand scheme of things. The first 4 issues I listed are nothing more than an equivalence of a pimple on a beautiful girls face. The First Order are even more ruthless and cold-blooded than the Empire(my jaws LITERALLY dropped as soon as the dreadnought made a dramatic entrance), They added more layers Luke's character arc(the realism at the fact that he made a dreadful mistake having the thought of striking down Kylo Ren makes me enjoy Luke's character even more. Thats realism for ya. Humans making mistakes.) Rey I understand why people are angry that she has not lost a lightsaber fight - but the grand scheme of things is that she DID fail. Her whole main goal was to turn Kylo Ren back to the light since she was too over confident within herself given that she knew the story of Darth Vader redemption prompting her to do the same with Kylo only to get in more disagreements when they met in person. She may have PHYSICALLY won against Snoke's guards(She struggled against 1 guard at a time while it was easy for Kylo to take down 3 at once) but in the grand scheme of things she overall lost. She failed to turn Kylo Ren back to the light. She failed to do what Luke succeeded in doing in ROTJ. That convinces me she is far from a Mary Sue. A ton of other people say that instead of Holdo doing that sacrifice it should have been the meme character Admiral Ackbar - But these fanboys are not understanding that out knowledge of Holdo isn't any different from Ackbar. I get the fact it was a missed opportunity but don't you all think that it would have been strange that someone with the last name ""ACKBAR"" did a suicide action like that....? I shouldn't have to explain why.... Cause anybody with a functioning brain would know what I am referring to.... Anyways... I cannot wait until 19 years from now in the year 2037 EVERYONE will get over and grow out of their hate and appreciate this film's existence. Right now everyone is going on a tirade about how its such a ""sellout film"" but once time moves forward - everyone is going to appreciate this film more as the years go by. Luke's projection on Crait will go down as one of the best moments in cinema history. For now this film is shat on 24/7. But it won't be controversial for long once everybody grows onto it. I absolutely LOVE the scene where he looks at the binary sunset one last moment before he dies. A New Hope he started off as a farm boy wishing to become more than he already is - to become a hero. Then in The Last Jedi - he dies protecting the last of the Resistance and looks at the binary sunset one last moment before he dies. So powerful. It made me cry. I was hoping Luke would not die.

"Yikes. Heteronormative much? Star Wars 7 (aka Force Awaken) led us diehard fans to believe that there was a budding romance between protagonists Finn and Poe Damoron. We waited anxiously with baited breath in hopes that we would finally get to see a genuine male/male (interracial) relationship on the silver screen. Star Wars was going to finally break the mold by presenting viewers with a gay couple we could root for but instead Disney pulled a classic bait-and-switch. I guess they had to cave into the demands of all the homophobic people that are in charge of things right now so they could convince their backwards manchild audience to cough up fifteen dollars. Fingers crossed that Finn is just doing this for appearances and Poe is actually the object of his heart's desires, but with the way things are going lately I wouldn't be surprised if Disney/Lucasfilm decide to churn out more exclusionary trash for their overwhelmingly straight white male gamer audience. The believability of the film is strained further by this forced cishet ""romance"". Finn is way too hot for Rose. It would be more believable if her character was trans, but again, that wouldn't play well with Disney's ""core demographics"" (aka BLORMPF voters aka the real life First Order). Disney will not be receiving another dollar from me after this stab in the back. I was literally shaking when I saw the on-screen kiss.

Never thought I'd say this, but I certainly hope Kylo/Ben and Rey figure out a way to bring balance to the Force together. Balance is not about the Galaxy being ruled by the Sith exclusively nor the Jedi alone. Balance means exactly that. Balance! According to Snoke they are equally matched on opposite ends of the Force. There's no denying the Force-Skype sessions between the two lonely and misunderstood misfits Kylo/Ben and Rey have brought them together in ways no other Jedi/Sith have ever connected before. They achieve a level of emotional intimacy at a very deep level. If there's one word I could use to describe their connection now is this: sensual. Supposedly, it was Snoke who arranged the Force-Skype sessions, yet by the end of the movie, after Skoke was already dead, Rey and Kylo/Ben managed to connect via Force-Skype yet again. Their paths are intertwined in ways neither of them yet realize. I know this is not meant to be a romantic type of movie, but it would make sense to have the two opposites meet in the middle somehow.

One thing that I didn't like about the Force Awkens was how similar it was to A New Hope. I was a little worried this movie would copy the Last Jedi. 
Thankfully though, other than a few plot points, it doesn't. The story is an original well written story. It feels completely different from the last 8 Star Wars movies, but yet still manages to have that feel like a Star Wars movie. Forget all the theories you have heard about this movie.

The Force Awakens was a great HOMAGE to the original and made me look forward this one. Pre-ordered the tickets as soon as they were on sale. And after seeing it, I couldn't help but feel...joy. At the beginning of the film, I didn't know how to feel because it wasn't what I was expecting. And I don't mean the scene itself. More like the tone I suppose. It felt off but at the same time, I kind of loved it. That was me during half of the movie. I was torn to say the least. It finally clicked for me when they landed on Canto Bight. Funny huh? I think that's where I just decided to embrace the movie for what it was. Not saying that I thought it was bad and I just lowered my expectations. Just...different. A lot of the things people had problems with, I didn't mind so much. Luke's reaction to the lightsaber was more shocking than comedic. Was a great way to say this isn't the film you're looking for. The identity of Rey's parents wasn't that important to begin with but people made it out to be. It would've been so easy to just label her a Skywalker or a Kenobi. But Rian Johnson didn't take that route and I couldn't be happier. A lot would disagree but I don't care. And the whole thing with Snoke...would it have made a difference if he was Darth Plagueis? Look, people have real criticisms with the film AND THAT'S FINE. But the way people are talking about it, they make it sound like an Ed Wood piece. It deserves more than that. Most of the stuff in the The Last Jedi I didn't like were the smallest things. The shot of Luke and Rey on the cliff looked a little fake, one random transition swipe stuck out, not enough milking. The Force Awakens is a more consistent movie but the highs of this are so HIGH. That controversial scene with Holdo and the ship left me in awe.

"I was raised on Star Wars, Star Trek, Lynch's Dune, and The Day the Earth Stood Still. My stepfather would buy the SW novelizations and I read them obsessively as a kid. I also read the kid series that he didn't buy (support your local libraries!). I think it's safe to say that I have some well-grounded, pertinent knowledge. I feel when rating a movie like this (with the well-publicized reactionary reviews) I have to present my bona fides first thing. 
I liked this movie a lot. Was it perfect? No. Was it the worst movie in the series? HAHAHAno. How does it compare with the original trilogy? I think it compares rather well. But that also means it suffers from some of the same weaknesses of the original series while facing an audience less willing to handwave said weaknesses away.
The main thing I saw people who weren't being reactionary complain about were plot holes. Were there as many as people say? Well...not really. The phrase gets thrown around a lot when people are ragging on a movie, but the accepted definition is still the one in common usage. There were plot WEAKNESSES, definitely, but a plot hole is a gap in the narrative that (and this is the key point) ""goes against the flow of logic *established by the story's plot*."" Which means if something follows the internal logic that has been established...it's not a plot hole. There were a couple narrative choices that made me roll my eyes, there were moments that seemed illogical to me but fit the previously established characterization, and there was one section that just seemed so pointless. I didn't like those bits and it took this movie from a 10 to an 8 (well, more like a 9.5 to a 7.5). They weren't plot holes, they were just poor choices.
Overall, I think this movie has a solid standing in the Star Wars pantheon. I know fans who raved and put it as their new number one, I wouldn't go quite that far. But it's definitely in the top half of my rankings.",0.08759469696969699,0.45925662878787876

"Absolutely agree on everything said from most people here. The major problem with the film that some people dont understand, is the AGGRESSIVE nature of dishing everything people liked about SW mythos so as to establish new grounds. Aggressiveness breeds resistance, and I sure felt insulted and angry. Case in point or the whole movie in a scene?

"SPOILERS: Grief is one of those processes that do not sink in immediately, and one that best describes what I feel after sitting through and processing this movie. As the big plot twist Is finally revealed after a few teases-did he just-oh wait, there he is!! Phew....WHAT!-I found myself smiling, maybe wincing and grimacing at my fellow movie-goer, as if I'd just consumed an entire lemon. I was sort of in denial. ""no. Nahhhhhhh. Nope, they can't be THAT stupid. They didn't take a 40 year legacy, one of the greatest cinematic icons of all time, and drop it into the trash like a moldy zucchini in the back of the fridge. So...he's immortal, right?"" But, here we are. And, much in the way that the film fumbled through most of the potentially emotionally powerful scenes, leaving any impact squandered, (especially the moving-saber tip-off when Emo-Rem is about to bisect SNOPE, an undevelopped villain-who'll probably get fleshed out in some other prequel-remember, every plot hole is now an opportunity for future shameless cash-grabs) the impact was ruined because this is simply bad writing. It's a crap idea. Relying on Luke (and Leia's) well and wonderfully developped characters to drag us into the theater, while barely breathing life into the new generations, and then having them ripped away from us, leaving us with character dynamics with almost NO emotional depth-no, they're not doing this. A few days later, it sank in that they had in fact done exactly that. After a few glimmers of hope and promise that we were getting to embrace the world of Skywalker again, to see what this childhood deity had blossomed into, I was enraged that he was just another cheap plot device-and these seem to be the cheap nostalgic fumes that the sequels are now running on. Another scene where beloved character X swoops in (Wookie, droid, what have you), queue day-saving music and high pitched droid noise-wookie/tribble scream. Star Wars was always hokey, based on plot lines and far superior filmmakers' work, yes, but it pulled is into its new world and made us love it. Seeing the trailers for these films used to choke me up, as they represented another chance to revisit that galaxay far, far away and a piece of my childhood-character and actors who weren't master thespians of their time (okay, well, one or two exceptions, haha). There was the possibility to bring the heart and soul of those original films into a new, turbulent era. The fact that whatever morons made this film aspired to nothing more than resuscitating a global brand for another generation, is an artistic tragedy. A promising new cast, and perhaps the biggest hero in cinema history, and it's all been reduced to recycled devices, and a 2 1/2 hour product placement for its own legacy. CGI space battles will never match the impact of the models-watching the Making of Star Wars specials impacted my imagination as a child, to see all of the creative seem and stuffing of every giant puppet and exploding green screen star base, now replaced by lazy paint-by-numbers explosions.

Especially the spot where the final battle takes place, which is just stunning. The action sequences are once again top-notch, with the typically exhilarating dogfights being typically exhilarating.

Honestly I feel if they had a good writer like Zack Snyder or David Ayer this movie might be good and have enjoyable moments but instead they get some nut job who doesn't know what they are doing. Another thing this movie gets right is adding new music instead of the terrible music which came from the original trilogy, occasionally the classic star wars music pops up and it really just ruin the scenes .

"Star Wars, Episode VIII: The Last Jedi has been rightfully lauded for its many plot twists. Rian Johnson places characters in positions that audiences believe can only end in one way...barring the deux ex machina that turns each situation around just as the audience has given up hope. Johnson's latest addition to the Star Wars Saga introduces new characters and builds upon old ones. In true Star Wars fashion, the budding (and perhaps unreciprocated romance) of the sequel trilogy occurs in the second episode of the trilogy, just as it did in Attack of the Clones and The Empire Strikes Back. This particular romantic subplot was a quaint and somewhat tragic departure from the main plot, which allowed Johnson to introduce new characters, locations, and species. Ultimately the individual subplots that follow each of the stars neatly converge in the typical, climactic Star Wars battle that one has grown to expect from the franchise. It is worth noting that The Last Jedi is one of the most beautifully shot films of the series. Each frame creates a balance of color, light and dark, that seems to echo the Force itself. And, as always, John Williams demonstrated his magical mastery of music and melody. As a work of cinema, The Last Jedi is enjoyable, even good.",0.17283549783549784,0.4741341991341991

It did not make me like any character and I could not understand what makes them act the way they did and why they have feelings they had.
Another annoying element of the movie was that the only reason why there was a positive chinese character is to give a big fat kiss into ... for chinese government to get the movie shown on the Chinese market. Really, I respect chinese people, but the thought that they are just buying the market entry with this trick ruins the movie.

The movie portrays women as strong at the expense of men to such a degree that it sucks the fun out of a what should be a shared adventure like in the original 1977 Star Wars where a spunky Leia takes her would be rescuers blaster and starts shooting. Since Lucas was forced out of the franchise he created it has gone from reasonable to awful.

Can anyone honestly argue that Kylo Ren is a better villain for the trilogy than Snoke could have been( i don't even dare to compare Ren with Palpatine)?
 
As for Rey's parentage i REALLY want to hope that Ren was either lying or didn't know because if he was telling the truth and her parents are just random scavenger scum who sold her off then the whole thing becomes a sad and stupid joke. Even Rey's supposed flirting with the Dark side ( one of the highlights of the movie for me) went nowhere since Rey suddenly forgot about her anger and resentment and became a paragon of light.",0.06176767676767677,0.5984848484848484
The movie was well made when it comes to the special effects but the storyline was just painful to watch. Daisy Ridley and Adam did saved the movie for me because I like their interaction and they are such a great actors. Deep down I wanted Rey to be the grand daugther of Palpatine and that she join Kylo and they ruled the galaxy together. But it was more of the same! I hope ep. IX saves the trilogy!! I've got my hopes up!,0.14462081128747795,0.5594797178130511

The sheer joy that I experienced as a eager 25 year old back in 77 on opening day for Star Wars is the opposite feeling upon leaving the theatre today.

But unfortunately only 5 minutes in to the film I was already rolling my eyes and fearing the worst. The scene in question was when Poe (Evidently the greatest pilot ever known) drives out to the destroyer to speak to General Hux and, after his rousing response we get the old ""Can you hear me?"" joke - not funny the first time we hear it, and certainly not several minutes later when the joke is still going on.

"I sort of like it and don't like it! The main problem with these films now is, they don't have the George Lucas touch and here's why I say this! The original three are without doubt the best by a long shot! Even the three later that had the George Lucas moments where the audience went ""yeah"" e.g Yoda fighting Christopher Lee, Darth Maul killing Qui and then Obi Wan waiting for the force field to go down, great moments. But these new films do not have these moments! Other things that annoy me about this film, the General, he's like a little college boy, how is he second in command? This should be a character like Grand Moth Tarkin, a leader, a man who has a menace about him, not even Darth Vader talked down to him, he had respect. The Emperors guards, looked like a bunch of samurai's, why not just the usual Emperors guards rather than these new ones. The AT-AT's, why do they have to be different, what was the point in them having fists or hands as feet, they never did anything, and the originals from empire look more realistic. Even in the other film before this they could not get the size of these correct, you had Rai leaning up against the foot of one in the dessert, lol, I think JJ got confused between the size of a Scout Walker and an AT-AT here! SO this is episode 8, a huge joke if you ask me! What was the story, rebels on the run, stuck in space with the imperials on a slow pursuit after them, hmmm, very weak. Benicio Del Toro, great actor, but what was with the stuttering, did that add some sort of value to the character other than annoyance? The main boss, he sat in the chair and died, what a let down he was! Darth Vader wannabe, he is okay, but Darth Vader also always had other villains in the films, it was never just him, Jabba The Hutt, Boba Fett, Monsters, Emperor, Sand People, etc etc there were always multiple dangers in the original films. The base at the end, all this time, and they never knew about the way out at the back? Hmm, if you say so. The snow fox things, was strange, my friend explained they were from the cartoons, which is good if you watch these, but I don't, so I guess the writer assumes everyone watches the cartoons, which I don't. Luke at the end, what was that about? At first I thought, yes, Luke is very powerful when he was getting shot down, but then it turned out to be a Doctor Strange astral projection and to top it off at the end he just vanished into thin air, at least Obi Wan Kenobi was holding off Vader in the first instance when he did this, knowing he could not win the fight, also George Lucas always said he regretted doing that, then this writer comes along and just does that to Luke? Really? So now we're gonna have ghost Luke appearing everywhere all the time even thogh ghost Annakin, Obi Wan have totally vanished, LMFAO! Get a proper writer for the last film, the George write it for crying out loud, JJ Abrahams is not that good and very overated, and this guy who wrote this must have had his blessing!

"The movie is an astonishing echo of the words spoken by the Jedi master. Over the last days I've seen something that has really bewildered me. A gap in the Star Wars community that has really left me in awe. In all my time as a Star Wars fan I've never seen such a split reaction to anything in the franchise. So just so you are aware, I adore Star Wars so take my opinions on the film with that in mind. 
Star Wars the last Jedi is a grade A film, period. The reasons why the community is so split are honestly beyond me. The film is as original as can be and takes risks never before seen in the saga, some of these risks have sparked the ongoing feuds in the community. But without getting into spoilers, the film expands on the rich lore and mythology of the galaxy we were first introduced to over 40 years ago. The idea of taking risks like these is something that Rian Johnson embraced fully as we embark on a story that is unexpected but right. 
It is not what you might have wanted at first but by the end the story turns into what you didn't know you needed. Developing characters like Rey and Kylo Ren even more so than in TFA. We also get major screen-time from Luke, Leia and Poe who were limited to smaller roles in the prior installment.
This brings me to my next topic and that is Carrie Fisher, wow. It was hard watching her on screen after her untimely passing, but the way she was handled in this film is truly beautiful. She was also excellent in the film, much better than in TFA where her acting was a bit on the rusty side. 
Andy Serkis is memorizing, frightening and menacing as Snoke and gives an excellent performance alongside Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. Who peels back the layers of his character making him one of the most relatable and complex villains in all of the saga. Overall the acting is on point and no single performance is flat or dull. 
Finally the direction by Rian Johnson is memorizing as he injects his persona into the heart and soul of this film. Flashy but full of heart and emotion and littered with moments of jaw dropping events that stack up against the best of the saga. 
And if I had one complaint with the film it would be a certain story arc that really detracts from those other moments in the film. It bogs the pacing down to a halt as we take a detour from the main plot of the film and are left wondering why was the subplot added in the first place. 
Having said that The Last Jedi is a great film, full of moments that hold up against the original trilogy. Everything from the action, development, cinematography and direction was immaculate and is some of the best in the saga. The film wasn't perfect though as a subplot in the film slows the pacing and takes our focus away from the overall plot, however it is still a dang great film. I would put it over TFA and RO and just over Return of the Jedi as number three in my list. I believe that the community is giving it unfair hate, but that is to be expected. However don't let them decide, go out there and see it for yourself and maybe you'll love it as much as I did.

The first half of the movie is a lot of filler that did not need to be there. I get what the over arching idea is supposed to be. The resistance in their most desperate hour, losses are great, choices are made, authority is questioned. I like all that but it could have progressed in a better paced way.

"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is probably one of the most hated films of 2017. But, personally, I think it's very good. However, the film does suffer from plot holes and questionable plot choices. Some character moments did not work as well as others, especially the kiss between Rose and Finn (which felt a quite forced and unearned). 
But what makes 'The Last Jedi' worth the watch? This film delivers some of the most memorable, if not iconic, moments in Star Wars history - the throne room battle, Holdo's hyperspace sacrifice, Luke using 'force-projection' to Kylo Ren, etc. The film is not afraid to make bold choices to explore uncharted creative territories that previous installments have yet to consider. The developing relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey is quite interesting. The two flawed and chaotic characters clash and question their allegiances in their search for identity and purpose. The performances were fantastic! The Last Jedi largely excels on its technical aspects such as cinematography, musical score and VFX. Take Holdo's sacrifice for example: once the ship went through lightspeed, the heightened music explodes into silence as the audience witness a breath-taking composition of light, darkness and wreckage. There are a couple of other beautiful shots in the film including a wide-shot of Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker on a planet covered with white salt and red soil, with their iconic lightsabers pointing at each other. John William's score is, once again, amazing and the visual effects are impressive! The incredible attention to detail to the world-building makes this film feel much immersive and engaging. It feels much more personal and smaller-in-scale than its predecessors for most of its duration, but for its benefits. Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is bold, visually-striking and entertaining with some of the most memorable Star Wars moments in history.",0.21821428571428572,0.5057341269841268

Not many of the other characters faired better with awful story telling and screen writing.

Instead they decided to fit the Hollywood liberal narrative by including a totally unnecessary female sidekick for Finn, making Rey a nobody, give the princess mind bendingly strong forces powers with no detail on how she has developed these after ROTJ and turning the only real dominant male character Luke a total shell of his old self. I watched and watched thinking something would happen to make me change my mind but it never came.

There's a couple of things that happen that make you think well that was quick and pointless but other than that people need to get down off their directors chairs and just enjoy a film again. It's a film where you should just sit back and enjoy. Disney have put the money in and perhaps the story is alittle off it's still a good film. People are constantly looking for faults or comparisons to other films instead of just enjoying something. At the end of the day it's not real so just enjoy the action and the new characters!

"Been a star wars fan for as long as I can remember. If that's a sentence that could explain you, then Disney did you dirty. 
In what should have been an easy dunk for Rian after JJ gave him a nice alley-oop, turned out to be a 2hr+ low speed car chase with subplots that don't bloom due to poor root structure. 
One of my favorite things about Star Wars has always been the fun mystery of their Universe. Who was doing what, what was going to happen next. This movie killed that. 
There's nothing of interest left when the credits start to roll. Every plot point from Force Awakens has dead ended. Every story arc in the Last Jedi fails to reach any climax worth note. 
Who is Finn - nope
Who is Rey - nope
Who is Snoke - nope
What does Luke know - nope
What's Poe going to do - nothing
What's Leia going to do - nothing
Where's Kylo story headed - meh no where really
What was with Phasma - nothing
Will they explore Han's death - who?

The only thing left is for Leia to die and Kylo to either change over or die.
*/*
There were so many missed opportunities in this movie for interesting plot, and instead they edited in sub plots to sub plots with equal screen time to the main story line, and only interesting story line for that matter, of Rey and Luke. What's worse is those plots serve no purpose. By the third act, all subplots have proven to have gone nowhere. They don't even help with character development. Imagine, with the length of this movie, having to sit through subplots that you don't care about because there was no character development. And its for a good 20 minutes at a time!
To add insult to injury, your intelligence is insulted at the end of these sequences when the movie just casually moves along hoping your brain won't start to smoke as it fails to get past the phrase ""why didn't they just...""
The special effects are just ok compared to other recent Star Wars releases. The action is just ok. The jokes almost always fall flat unless you are 7yrs old or find yourself laughing at what a 7yr old would. 
The icing on the whole thing is the self-aware, almost meta nature of the movie purposefully and gleefully distancing itself from the original fan base, and taking on critics of the Force Awakens. Not only does this movie throw out nearly every plot point from Force Awakens, it fundamentally changes the Star Wars universe. All just to subvert your expectations. That is, if your expectations were continuity and full character arcs. That'll show people for talking for two years about who Snoke is. ""Stop talking about my movie kids!"" -Rian, probably. Imagine going to your friends house and knocking on the door; but when your friend answers he doesn't let you in. Instead he reaches for the welcome rug to pull out from under you! You can feel the tension building; there's going to be a pay off with an analogy of your friend pulling the rug out from under you like Disney did with its fans right? No, instead he accidentally headbutts you in the junk, can't lift the rug cause you're too heavy, and your dog dies for no reason. What a bold story telling decision! 
A lot of these criticisms could be shared with the prequels, and at the very least these new Star Wars movies do not have annoying characters. Just huge plot holes that distract you, poor story telling, and odd plot twists that serve no emotional purpose. 
The best explanation I've ever received about story telling was a simple analogy:
A story is like a hike up a mountain. The reader/watcher is the hiker. They know they're going to need to invest time and energy for this hike, so it better be worth it. Imagine they have a backpack on and every piece of info you give them is a brick they need to put in their backpack (characters, back stories, motives, actions that build climax ,etc). You edit your story by making sure by the time the hiker gets to the top of the mountain they're not pissed off they carried all these bricks for no reason. 
That concept of story telling for Rian must have been like the joke about the roof.
 In a bold nihilistic approach, Rian has managed to make everything mean nothing. 
I will not be seeing the next Star Wars movies in theater. That's a sentence I never thought I would write. But it doesn't matter anyway. People will still flock to it and the next 7 movies they pump out will make a billion dollars but be worth nothing like the cultural ephemera they are.",0.09246505875077304,0.44676504844361986

"Plot Holes: There were SOOO many things that didn't make sense.
1. Personal armor that deflects lasers exists now in the SW universe, but the Empire, who has seemingly unlimited resources, only gives it to one trooper (Captain Phasma).
2. One person has to stay back on the ship that is inevitably going to get destroyed, when we know auto pilot already exists (Anakin flying to the Battle Above Naboo), droids could easily do this task, and technically the absence of gravity could keep the ship going without anybody driving.
3. The resistance complains about losing so many bombers during the early space battle, but they could have just weaponized warp speed like they do at the endish of the movie and only wasted one ship because Finn knows where the tracker is housed in the lead Empire Cruiser. All they had to do is punch a hole through that area with 1 bomber and then leave.
4. The salt sleds clearly do not fly at the same speed. When Poe tells everyone to retreat from attacking the canon, Finn keeps going while Rose turns back. She then has the time to change her mind, turn around, catch up to Finn, and take a wide-looking path to knock Finn out of the sky when he's like 100 yards away.
5. Then, after they crash, Finn leaves his plane, finds Rose, and begins a conversation before the cannon goes off. He clearly would have made it to the destination in time and possibly prevented the wall's destruction.
6. The resistance only escapes the mine because wild creatures made of salt came inside with their new human friends, who just landed on the planet, and slowly helps them to find the exit. So the outside animals ran inside to be with people they don't know to help escape the Empire (who they also don't know). Strangely moral creatures.
7. Snokes is currently reading Kylo's mind when Kylo is thinking about killing him, but doesn't see it coming; this leading to the worst master/apprentice fight ever.
8. Luke's main criticism of Rey is that she doesn't resist the Dark Side in her training. He even adds that she didn't even try to resist. However, 20 minutes later she is the arbiter of the Light Side to Kylo trying to convince him to leave the Dark Side.
9. On that note, they still haven't explained how Rey, who skipped all Jedi training and lives in a time of no Jedi, can still connect with the force to do crazy stuff. I think Disney tried to fix this by having the fight between Rey, Kylo, and the red troopers be absent from force abilities.
10. Certainly not last, but last for this post, is that Leia apparently can survive long enough in the vacuum of space while she's unconscious to pull herself to safety. I understand it's not a real universe, but SW has always abided somewhat to the basic principles of life, which, to me, would include the horrible effects open space would have on a person's body.",-0.006184123847167315,0.4356060606060606

Also a great last performance from Carrie Fisher. Cast standouts are Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, and Carrie Fisher. Although one of the critisisms is the lack of OG trilogy support characters. For exsample C3PO, R2D2, and Chewbacca. Similar to TFA, they were underused. But hopefully JJ can tackle that in ep 9.

One or two of the scenes could have been taken out and swapped for something else, maybe more Chewbacca, C3PO, or R2D2.

There are many more similar examples. Yes, there is some boring filler. Finn has no point other than to be a convenient source of knowledge about base and ship layouts.

In the first films he had this aloofness, a sense of being far away. And this suited him well. It also added depth, perhaps meaning to the films. His sensitivity would have been a powerful vehicle if his character was handled less sloppily here. The writing decisions here make him come off as weak, unsure, even a bit unstable.

I was worried that ""The Last Jedi"" would be a remake of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" given ""The Force Awakens,"" but fortunately there is only a nod in that direction.

If 'Star Wars' was not in the title this movie would be a massive gamble for a studio and possibly a flop so why make something that so completely disrespects and throws in the trash everything that came before it (including TFA).

Snoke is just a secondary character, or did they want to repeat the figure of the Emperor? Rey's parents are (in principle) scrap dealers, or did they want her to be Luke's daughter, or Obi Wan's granddaughter, or Yoda's niece, or what? Or did they prefer that Snoke had appeared and cut off Rey's hand, saying ""I am your father""? Would you prefer to constantly repeat the original trilogy? The characters are not going to be eternal, or would you prefer them to die in the explosion of a ship or while destroying the new base of the enemy, as in the Return of the Jedi?

None but to wrong foot the audience into thinking he would matter. A plot device. Similarly the ""mystery"" over Super Rey's parentage dissolved into an ""anyone can be special"" didacticism. I don't really care which (force) orientation Ren plumbs for in the finale. Either way it won't be a surprise. And he doesn't instlil any fear. No Darth Vader. Two films in, what has the point been of making his entire character, what in the OT was one small part of Vaders- his conflict from ROTJ? I'd rather he were just plain evil. Maz thingy, Phasma and the Leia temporary replacement, all forgettable. What was the point bypassing Leia for half the film? A plot device to delay the reveal of her escape plan. Too much painting by SW numbers. And that casino planet stuff was straight out of the PT. The Bond films all have certain key elements, which even when repeated, rarely feels quite so blatant.

"Warning major spoiler ! So this is Disney, a well oiled machine. Completely competent movie but completely vanilla. Somewhere I read that this movie had an unexpected ending and broke all the star wars tropes. Nothing could be further from the reality. 
Disney the money making machine, heard that people hated the prequels (which by the way I love) and loved the original trilogy. So what did they do, made the original trilogy over again with a new younger and more diverse cast. Every plot point in the empire stikes back is covered like a check list. Rebel base gets discovered and rebels need to escape: Check. Main young protagonist goes of to seek the master: Check. Ground war: Check. Need help and seek it out on a gambling planet but seem to get sold out to the bad guys: Check. K could probably go on. It is empire strikes back with a gender reversal with the main and secondary characters nothing more.
And as for the movie itself, there was no character in there I really liked except maybe the the Asian woman who was a Tec. I wasn't really invested in anyone. 
I loved Rogue one. I loved the characters . The robot was the best ever. I loved the backgrounds, the motivation. I loved the pseudo science. I cared about the characters. Why couldn't they have used the original extended star wars universe to create new movies rather then remake the originals. 
Also it was sloppy writing. Unless I missed something there was a huge plot hole. She the code breaking character betrayed them he did so by revealing that the shuttles were sneaking down to the planet. How did he know this? That information was never revealed to him. When they were captured they were still under the notion that they were trying to get down the tracker.
And by the way, the prequels. I am a science fiction fan and these were true science fiction. Science fiction can be about Tec. But mostly it is about the human condition, about who we are as humans and is dorm of the deepest most meaningful of writing as in Brave New World . The prequels where about how a society can sink into authoritarianism. They are high art and so relevant to our times there 20 years later and high art. The Last Jedi is not.

"Director Rian Johnson has delivered an intense, eye-popping, stirring and thought-provoking entry in the Star Wars saga, perhaps the best episode we've seen since the original trilogy. Johnson took the ""Christopher Nolan"" approach to Star Wars with this movie, giving it a darker, more realistic tone and a complex plot filled with reversals and reveals. In doing so, Johnson has created a far more interesting and involving movie than J.J. Abrams' bubblebrained retread The Force Awakens and the sloppy, unfocused Rogue One. While the movie lacks the dazzling visual splendor of George Lucas' prequels, most notably suffering from some uninspired creature designs, it makes up for that with its sheer sense of literacy. For the first time, audiences can have hope in the ongoing quality of Disney's Star Wars movies. ",0.22625,0.6058333333333333

Poor flow of story line, neigh the lack of a true plot or story line, but in the re-use of scenes barely re framed from the original movies. That made up the entire film! i hope they can some how manage to come back from the disaster they have made the series. Yet i doubt they can, RIAN JOHNSON wrote the worst star wars movie to date. If they allow him to write another one it is a horrible choice. The dialouge in the film, and even the plot line where it existed at all were horrible, i could keep going but i think any true star wars fan or even film critque would notice the same things. I have been a devoted fan for close to 30 years. Well they have managed to completly ruin that along with the star wars name.

"This movie just doesn't feel like Star Wars, it tries to appeal to kids with humour at the same time it tries to make a dark movie for adults. At the same time it has many story telling problems, such as no development for the character Finn, no development for the character of Rey and the only developed character i the antagonist, which is now main antagonist, Kylo Ren. Despite completing many points started in it's predecessor, most answers where short and didn't had any real impact on the overall story, the villain Snoke was being built up both movies and he just dies without any explanation of who he was or even what his powers were, captain Phasma was being built up by books and comics to be the next big antagonist and she was killed with only 1:48 seconds of screentime. Besides, more than 30 minutes of the movie had no impact on the movie, since what happened in these minutes was more slapstick humour (and not a very good one) and a illusion of plot moving forward,at the end of that scene, he heroes fail to acomplish what they were told to get there and just follow without it to accomplish the exact same thing they were triyng to accomplish in those 30 minutes in one minute. 
This movie biggest crime is being overall boring, the second is that it removed any potential for a sequel since it ended all problems started in the previous installment and didn't create any new points,the third problem is the fact is that beside being boring, it talks like it is great but it doesn't feel like the original trilogy or even like the prequel trilogy.
If you liked it, that's okay, but it's not good or even entertining",0.0471613912403386,0.4195022083179978
So apparently Star Wars can't seem to get out of it's own way when it comes to story telling. They keep rehashing the same old story lines as they appear to move forward. The parallels in The Last Jedi compared to The Empire Strikes Back are so hard to miss that even the most novice fan would be left wonder why they told this story again. You may as well call Rey the female version of Luke because their stories are exactly the same. Both grow up on a barren desert planet. Both have this strange gift they know nothing about. Both seek guidance from a master but they have to return to face someone whom they try to turn back to the light while their friends are dying in a desperate battle. ,0.05989583333333332,0.3234375
"All the male characters in Star Wars: The Last Jedi were portrayed as weak and foolish to fulfill one aspect of Hollywood's liberal agenda, and indeed, current liberal doctrine of ridiculing, belittling etc. as a way to diminish their adversaries status thus elevating themselves. Culturally such behavior is extremely destructive as it's motivation is hate. The movie portrays women as strong at the expense of men to such a degree that it sucks the fun out of a what should be a shared adventure like in the original 1977 Star Wars where a spunky Leia takes her would be rescuers blaster and starts shooting. Since Lucas was forced out of the franchise he created it has gone from reasonable to awful. There are no male heroes in this movie, just eunuchs.",-0.12916666666666665,0.4734375

"I had begun writing a review a few days after seeing this, listing all of the missteps this film makes, both as part of the franchise, and as a standalone on its own merits. It's too long to post here. Suffice it to say that people's main complaint about The Force Awakens was that it felt too familiar, a reworking/ rehash of the very first Star Wars (since termed ""A New Hope""), and The Last Jedi eschews all the familiarity completely, creating not mere twists and surprises but gaslighting our understanding of our favorite Star Wars characters and inventing an unfamiliar lore. I know why people did not like TFA, and I respectfully disagreed. I cannot comprehend why people like The Last Jedi. If TFA was too much like Star Wars, then the producers and director Rian Johnson (let him never work in the same galaxy as Star Wars again--I'm not quite to the point of spitting on the ground when I say his name, but I am thinking about it) made quite sure this completely flipped the script, to the point of insulting all the fans who claimed to want to see something new (be careful what you wish for). I am intentionally avoiding spoilers, as those are in my ""long"" review (this one isn't exactly a pamphlet), and there are simply too many poor choices in character development and storyline. Save for the exceptional visuals (particularly the final hyperspace sequence), and an admittedly excellent performance from Adam Driver, this movie has very little to offer Star Wars fans, or movie fans in general. Its attempted humor is almost always mean-spirited sarcasm (or an aloof wink through the fourth wall), the character development relies on a necessary regression to make it seem, and there is an unnecessarily political theme which would be very unpalatable in most other science fiction movies, but is particularly out of place here. Many people are complaining about the overtly feminist message. I disagree. I have no issue with the strong female characters, even when portrayed beyond the point of implausible Mary Sue perfection. It's that the male characters are always so deficient, with the above-mentioned character regressions serving inexpertly as character development, that the female characters' wisdom and authority seem so incongruous. Even an old friend shows up and behaves maniacally. 
I checked imdb the next day to see what TLJ was being rated; it was an 8.2 at that time. I thought not only are the critics wrong (I was excited to see this movie based on the reviews I read just a day before), but they were likely bought off by Disney. Moreover, the imdb members were giving this a rating that was way too high. It has since settled into a more appropriate 7.6, but even that seems too high for this. Many people are logging on to give it fewer stars than it actually deserves, to offset the many too-high ratings (anything above a 7). How bad/ even divisive is this move? It is lowering the rating of the Force Awakens! People are logging in to pan that movie (much better than this one, on nearly all levels), just to prove their love for this. I was planning to pan this as a 1, to offset the high ratings, but I will give it a more honest 4 stars (2/5) for the excellent space battle cgi, the choice to bring back an old friend in a more familiar form, and Adam Driver's performance, each of which merit another consideration of this entry into the Star Wars canon.",0.1694926376440461,0.48673881673881686
"Rian Johnson has made one of the most visually compelling Star Wars films in the series, though I really dislike the retro look in this trilogy. Sadly, the The Last Jedi spends the first two-thirds of its running time recycling material and clichés from Star Wats or other films-the rebels are still devising the same plan from earlier episodes, but with a new twist; the reluctant or disillusioned master (Luke) that refuses to train a younger apprentice, and so on. Having said that, Rey's interactions with Luke felt rather flat, and uninspired, and her connection with Kylo Ren was more of a plot device. The last 40+ minutes were thrilling and well executed. The thing is, Rey is not convincing as a Jedi, it's not Daisy Ridley's fault-she's up to the part-but the filmmakers fault.",0.04331550802139037,0.4615418894830659
"And wow, did it offend some people. I wonder if Rian Johnson predicted the avalanche of hate he would receive. In any case he deserves an applause. The saga was stale. Episode VII was too safe, almost a remake for the newer generations. The Last Jedi is what it needed to avoid becoming a relic. It poses questions previously not even considered. It is inflammatory indeed. Yoda approves, as he also gets tired of the holiest Jedi writs, teaching old Luke a lesson. The theme is change, uncertainty and the bluriness of order and structures, especially adequate for the current times. Though this is not where the good ends: all this the film does with great skill; every scene powerful, every shot beautiful. The basic SW elements are still there, including the cheesy moments. This entry does not destroy the franchise, it reanimates it. It's hated now but it will be remembered as an important sequel. What is worrying is that maybe the fanboy backlash was big enough to influence the future direction of the series, which I hope won't return to flat reenactments of itself and will instead continue through this exciting new path.",0.0908216783216783,0.5472902097902098

"This was absolutely the most disappointing movie for an older Star Wars fan. It started with TFA and its departure from the established timeline of events and character development in the book series that was carefully directed from the Thrawn Trilogy up until Disney bought the franchise. What Johnson did to the heroic moisture farm boy of the original trilogy is mind boggling. He took Luke from hero (not afraid of anything) that stared down a Death Star and took on Darth Vader and then the Emperor; and turned him into a weepy, sniveling coward that hid away from everything and milked sea cows. Pathetic! I won't go on much more. The big mistake in my opinion was bringing back the original cast and the timeline. The first order, the resistance and this awakening of the force would have played much better had it been set further into the future. If it had been two or three generations later after Luke, Han and Leia. The character of Kylo Ren should have been Han and Leia's grandson or later descendant. If Disney would have picked up the story later in the timeline the ""old"" fans would have been happier. The fans who had developed a passion for the expanded 
universe characters over the years (like myself) could have gotten on board with Rey, Finn, Poe etc. All Disney had to do was leave the Expanded Universe characters of Mara Jade, Ben Skywalker, Jacen and Jaina Solo in the history, and picked up a story line after those and things would have been good.",0.1212962962962963,0.46585648148148145

"The movie is like the previous two Star Wars films released by Disney: Enjoyable, but underwhelming. No character is particularly interesting or worked out. The acting is overall mediocre. The plot feels like rehashes of previous Star Wars movie plots (pre-Disney). The story was continued, but when you think about what actually happened at the end of the movie, really not much has changed, and what did is not that interesting. There is good action, but it isn't a strong point in any way. There was some really great scenes and visuals, which also do great justice to the Star Wars vibe--I think this is the strong point of this movie.

In the first part there was even han and chewbacca in it and seeemed all natural. Now everything has changed. Luke is a sad old man who is acting like a sulky child. later on they even try makin him responsible for all evil by atempted murder on his pupil. horrible twist! Chewbacca kicks in his front door and screems at him like a maniac. what about the old time chewbacca who gave people big hugs? than there is ne characters who just appear on screen without any introduction. what about that chubby girl who is fins biggest admirer? she is sitting next to the escape-pods with a tazer waiting for people who try to save themselve - than tazing them and getting them court martialed for desertion? is that a pleasant character to fall in love with? there is so many strange stwists that i dont wanto analyse them all but they makin the movie horrible to watch for adult fans of the saga and not suitable for children due to exessive violence. the CGI-effects when people are riding on big pets or robots look just silly, like from a fantasy movie for children. people who can feel notice a diffrent handwriting of film-making. im glad i did not give them my cash at the cinema counter.",0.009523809523809516,0.4614285714285714

"First of all I'm a die hard Star Wars Fan but not a blind fan. I coldn't quite feel the vibe when first I saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2005) but I was hoping that the story will progress and the Episode VIII is going to be another classic afterall Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a new chapter and sort of an introduction of the new characters and what the Star Wars Univers has became. I think there were many inconsistencies in the story I was hoping to get answers of many of my questions as the episodes continue. Altough I couldn't shake the idea of Disney owning the franchise and could deliver something good out of it. I was ready to give a cahance to new episodes after all it was STAR WARS!
I had high hopes for Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi and I couldn't help myself but to go to the first show of the openning week. I felt my skin crawling when the classic introduction text and music started to appear on the big screen of course there was no way of knowing this was the only exciting moment of the whole movie that was suppose to be another Star Wars classic!!!
The story was terrible. Director and the cast were equially bad although the acting were not bad but not good either. Disney must learn just adding the millenium Falcon and all other characters of the old Star Wars movie can't make a good Star Wars movie!. With episode VII I thought Adam Driver was a joke and disgrace to all the sith Lords before him (especially Vader). With Episode VIII he even seems more of a disgrace. His character is terrible as well. Probably the worst sith Lord ever. Kylo Ren often times acts very childishly throughout the movie rather than a powerful Sith master or he is too weak of a character for even a sith apprentice. A big scratch on the villain . The other characters of the movie are just ok and even Mark Hamill is not quite enough for to save the day. Without getting into the details there were few interesting moments of the movie. As for that I gave 2 stars instead of 1.
I think Disney should quit messing up with classical story and should focus on side stories and maybe never told stories as Rogue One was much better movie than Episode VII and VIII combined.

It throws away any expectations and fan theories to create an emotional and deep character and action driven film like the originals did. It changes things with tone and lore like empire did, and keeps mysterious characters mysterious just like in the original trilogy. yes it lacks closure, but that has never been a bad thing in cinema.

This outing does the exact opposite, it strays far from the familiar, but yet, still fails to do some fan service by including Yoda (in a cameo), clearly it also fails to do this as many fans are calling for the head of Rian Johnson. What the film does well is self-conscious humor, instead of the over-serious tones of previous films, instead, actions are done which would seem out of place in any of the other films. Another point that has fans rabid is the fact that Luke Skywalker, and Yoda, seem to have a complete disdain for the Jedi faith. To me, this was refreshing, if the prior threat had been elimanated, then there clearly would have been no need for them any longer, or so I would reason. The last thing that will not appeal to fans is the fact that the helmuts have now come off, quite literally, they are no longer worn.",0.01447368421052632,0.39254385964912286

"There has been some controversy around how Luke Skywalker's last days was portrayed in the film. 
I saw the original Star Wars on opening day. It remains one of the most profound experiences of my life. I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks after. I have devoured every movie since and am still a big fan. 
With that background I have to say that I can relate to Luke as portrayed in the movie. I'm about the same age. While we start out life as heroes in our own story, failures accumulate. If we focus on those, particularly failing those we love it can eat our will to act. A person may be great at many things, as Luke is, but not able to handle failure well. Anyway I appreciated the brave path the writers and Disney took. Luke did find a way past his despair in the end and was very clever about how he expended his power. 
The Star Wars universe is full of potential and frankly while I enjoyed the last few pictures immensely they are starting to feel a bit episodic, hitting the same themes over again with the same one dimensional characters. 
I have read many of the Star Wars books and they contain a richness that has not quite made it to the screen. For instance they also reveal the true capabilities of a Jedi/Sith. Some of those capabilities were finally shown in this film with Snoke's manipulation of Rey's visions and Kylo Ren's conflict about his path also making the connection between her and Kylo Ren possible. 
Star Wars needs a reboot, I hope this film is the start.",0.18083333333333332,0.5305555555555556
"Opening scene set the tone for the whole film. Too much awkward comedy and downright dumb dialog dropped points to almost zero. After that it got little better. 
Visuals were top notch and it seems they keep getting better. I only wish the stories would too. 
This movie like its predecessor has cool characters that don't really do anything or by doing make themselves much less cool. 
Plot was almost carbon-copy of Empire strikes back with minor alterations. Again, just like the previous film was copy of New hope.
They also seem to come up with new Jedi powers for each movie that are never seen again. This really bothers me. And this is the 8th movie and we still don't know what the jedi or the force is and what you can do with it or what it means to be strong in the force or have a lot of midichlorians.Like if you have 100 force you cab lift 1 rock and with 1000 force it's 10 rocks.",0.10316985645933013,0.45661881977671454

"Good, but not great. If you have any scientific background, you'll very often be forced out of your suspension of disbelief by the story's frequent ignorance of the laws of gravity, the reality regarding transmission of sound in a vacuum, its disregard for how a battle environment would be under constant surveillance, etc. Still, the movie is satisfying in the same way that fast food will kill hunger.

If you can't allow them to take the series in new directions, you've forgotten the joy of losing yourself in Star Wars. I never saw many of the character changes that Episode VIII introduces, but I loved every minute of it. People like to forget that when the original trilogy was released, it had incredible flaws (Ewoks were a transparent marketing ploy. So are Porgs. Get over it). But since most of us that are writing reviews here were kids at the time we first entered the Star Wars universe, we just let ourselves get lost in the wonder of it.

So much to complain about and the main points I don't want to spoil this review.

"So where do i start... well the beginning would be the best place. From the opening scene, I knew I was not in the best hands and that all the work that J.J. Abrams had done to save the franchise from the hands of the prequels, had been undone. 
The opening scene in question, has Poe Dameron pretending that he cant hear what General Hux is saying on the intercom. In other Star Wars Film where perhaps Han Solo may have played such a joke, there is no way in hell that General Hux (or his equivalent) would have become a stammering idiot for no other reason than to create laughs. Tonally it was off, way off and from then on, I struggled to get back in. There are many problems in this film - many of them go to the heart of the story and script. The entire journey of Rose and Finn to some gambling planet was a complete waste of time - as was Rose's character altogether. A clear 'Disney' character inserted. The entire plot device surrounding the rebels star ship being tracked through light speed and then running low on fuel, lacked the tension that it no doubt wanted to create and I found myself actually bored on more than one occasion for extended periods of time. Which leads me to the biggest issues of the film. Luke.",0.1744318181818182,0.5037878787878788

"This should be the name of this movie. I wonder how much money Disney is paying to the critics for those high grades and good reviews! They certainly watched another movie or don't know nothing about the meaning of this saga! The Force Awakes was poor and weak but tolerable. It was like ""The New Hope - Part 2"". But this???? This is pure crap! From the beginning to the end it's horrible! I'm not going to tell any spoiler but until this moment I just can't believe that a garbage like this carries the name STAR WARS!!!!! This is an insult to this name, to Geroge Lucas and to the fans, like me! I won't see another Star Wars movie made by Disney! They ruined this franchise! I'm really angry! I can't even express how I feel about it! The movie is an absurd! Full of silly jokes, bad characters, empty story (I don't know if we can say it has a story!) and no answers at all. Things just happen from nothing! What they did to Luke was... so disrespectfull! After seeing this, I'm 100% sure that STAR WARS actually has 6 episodes. And they were written by the same person who created the saga and Knows about it, and loves it (or at least, he loved). But now we have each movie written by a different man, and the second just decided to give a slap on the first guy saying: ""Now this belongs to me and I'll do whaterever I want and I don't care about you, or George Lucas or the fans! They'll go to the movies anyway, so we'll make a lot of money and that's the only thing that matters to me and Disney"". This is really sad! Please stop now Disney!

"I'm with my age a Star Wars fan from the beginning. I love the ""Original Trilogy"" and the improved digital version, I appreciate the broad-spreaded informations of the ""prequel trilogy"", I cheered ""Rogue One"", I have an ambiguous status to the films of the new trilogy.
As I mentioned the films are loaded with action and attractive sets fishing for the applause of the audience and the fans by leaning on the plot and phrases of the ""Original Trilogy"".
George Lucas used ""archetypes"" as a fan from the ""one and only"" mythologist and scientist in religions Joseph Campbell. He invented worlds and characters who could have been possible in reality, he invented a believable system with his ""galaxy far far away"".
""The Last Jedi"" is only a fast-told story without any profundity. The time you hope to get an answer for the most interesting parts (Snoke, Kylo, Rey, the Knights of Ren, the Force actually) the plot switches to another part and leaves you flat. It's only half-truth.
In detail the humour and the new-founded irony is okay. The ""porgs"" are very ""disney-like"" but you would love them.
The lack of deepness in the character of Kylo Ren is unbearable! You won't get the answer what turned him that bad to kill his father, to hate Luke, to bow to Snoke, to his relationship to Rey. He has a conflict within. Snoke was responsible for that. Snoke could ""reed him like a book"" but missed it to pay attention that Kylo will kill him?
Snoke reigns the galaxy on a giant Star Destroyer. He has his own pretorian guards. He founded the First Order. He is the ""puppet master"". We don't get any answer to him till he was too easily through Kylo.
Leia's rebel flagship was bombed by the First Order. She was pushed into space- helplessly? No she used the Force to glide back into the flagship to be safe. Looked like some ""witch thing"". Ridiculous.
The rebel flagship navigates in front of the persecuting Star Destroyer in that distance that the guns couldn't reach it. In the meantime they send another ship th a ""casino planet"" to go for a ""decoder"" who may switch of the tracking signal on the Stardestroyer. They have the time to come back and board on the Star Destroyer in secret. That sounds ""surrealistically"". The Star Destroyer does nothing but shooting behind the rebel flagship till their fuel is empty, the rebel flagship does nothing but waiting for any help?!
The character of Finn found no ""work-out"". Plasma is senseless furthermore. Hux is ridiculous.
Luke is heavily depressed and disillusioned. He hides on a planet in nowhere. The only answer given to the audience is that he recognised the deep badness in Kylo.- That's why he gave up everything? That's why the only wanted to die in his ""nowhereland""? Thats why he wont help his friends his sister in a heavy crisis?- That's much too less for me! 
He doesn't give Rey lessons in the Force he just talks big about the Force. In the end Yoda- a highlight in the film- persuades him to act with responsibility. Luke confronts Kylo as an ""illusion"" from his planet and helps his comrades to escape. Then he becomes ""one with the Force"" totally exhausted and fades away.
Leia- please forgive me I loved her RIP- survives as the only human hero/heroine of the ""old human actorship"", the one who passed away last december. This is sarcastic, isn't it?

"Where does one begin to describe all this is wrong with this chapter of the story. And let me remind everyone that from the very start, way back in 1977, this has always been a Skywalker story. Episodes 4-6 of the original trilogy were about Luke Skywalker. Episodes 1-3 of the ""prequels"" were about Anakin Skywalker. Even episode 7 was about Luke. The story plot to episode was about finding Luke so he could save the day. And this movie comes out. Fans - and by fans I mean those who love and appreciate the entire Skywalker story up to this point - were led to believe that episode 8 was also Skywalker story. Just look at the movie poster.

"Rubbish. A disgrace to the Star Wars Saga. Its story was soul-less and shallow. There was scant little onto which an intellectual thread could be latched. What I disliked the most in TFA was the constant regurgitation of old ideas, plots and scenarios, cheap and mass produced attempts to use nostalgia to recreate the magic of the original trilogy. This time around they kept it down to an almost tolerable level but were clumsily mish-mashed in with a cargo freighters' load of plot holes and twists that infested the movie like drifting space junk. Keeping the viewer engaged for two and a half hours does require a pretty great script and this one certainly wasn't. There were moments that felt like the Empire Strikes back but no sooner did you begin to settle into the train of the story (after several failed attempts and more than half way through the movie) than a plot hole, twist or gag jumped out of light speed and crudely slapped you in the face.

"I liked this movie! First of all because it is different, fresh, and with new ideas! For me Episode 7 was very much predictable, and more or less a remake of ""A new Hope"". But The Last Jedi is completely unpredictable, at no point in the movie you could foresee the next step. That´s a quality! Most people didn´t understand the developement of Luke and say he is a weak old man and unrecognizable. Besides the fact that 30 years have passed and people change over time, Luke achieved a new perspective on the subject of the Jedi. He sees the ignorance and the failure, nobody owns the force, it is everywhere, everybody can use it for the good or for the bad. And to say, if the Jedi vanish the good vanish, is indeed arrogance. He is very strong in his attitude and I liked the fact that Johnson kept it this way. Of course people would have loved to see him fly away in the Falcon with Rey and Chewie to help the Resistance. But hey, he came to die on this island, he didn´t go in exile for fun...and by the way imagine seeing Yoda the first time again after Episode 1-3 in Empire Strikes Back. People would have said the same...what did happen to him oh my god he is attacking a droid with a stick begging for food. Luke is melking a seecow...of course thats exile on an island on the edge of the galaxy, so why not? Because Leia decided to keep on fighting it doesn´t necessarily mean that Luke has to help her. They are mature enough to make decisions by their own, Luke apologizes later because a little conflict still exists and it's a nice scene, but he keeps his own words and stays on the Island. The appearence of Yoda and his words that failure is the burden of all masters was a great moment and wise words indeed. From there on Luke made peace with his failure with Kylo and finds a perfect solution for his situation with his illusory appearence. Then most fans couldn´t accept the rising strength of Rey. too fast too powerful and I partly agree here, but its a new time, Snoke said the light is becoming stronger, so is the dark. They are both rising powers to mess with each other. And remembering that, could help accept the fast rising abilities of Rey. The fact that her parents are absolutely nobodys and that it is no longer a subject is indeed brave, and I liked it. What could be more boring than to have this topic again in the center of the story. It wants to say what I mentioned earlier, the force is everywhere, everybody can use it and it doesn´t necessarily has to do anything with your bloodline. Right so! The death of Snoke: For me, perfect, absolutely unexpected and from that moment on a new situation, fresh! And I can understand why Johnson didn´t make any efforts in telling his background story, his intentions and so on. The great villain has always the same intentions, and where he came from? From the dark side, what else do you need to know, who his parents were? The fact that the story of Rose and Finn end up in a desaster was nice too. Many fans say it was an unnecessary side story, ok, but they did it, I mean they tried, to help. It didn´t work out but thats life even in a galaxy far far away.. Anyway I hope to give you another perspective on the movie. Its not bad, just different, and yes the jokes are marginal sometimes and the scene with SuperLeia would have been much better as a ghost coming back to the body. The character of Hux is very poor too. Snoke explained why he has such a moron in such a powerful position at least. Thanks for reading!",0.17456573120366217,0.5829514355376424

"The purpose of The Last Jedi is to kill the idea that the Resistance need Luke Skywalker to ""spark hope"" in order to grow the Resistance and further it's aims.

So how it that Rey has leap frogged so far into her skills and knowledge, with virtually no training? 
Also, Star Wars movies have always been ripe and fertile ground for merchandising. That's why the forced insertion of various characters (usually of the muppet like variety) seems like more of a money grab than adding to the story telling arch of the movie.

"By the end of The Last Jedi, it seems Rian Johnson still hadn't figured out what tone he wanted for it. The film clumsily jumps from serious to embarrassingly unfunny slapstick humour every few minutes. It really feels like he never watched the original Star Wars films more than once, and doesn't understand its characters. The humour in Star Wars always came from the natural personality of its characters, look at the Han Solo ""boring conversation anyway"" line, it was a funny moment that felt natural (because it actually was) and completely fit the tone of the film, as well as the person saying it. In TLJ, Rian Johnson wrote a lot of scenes with lame gags, silly faces and people falling over and just pasted them on to his actors. Why do screenwriters now arrogantly assume they can just suddenly write comedy? If you read the reviews of critics, apparently being ""Marvel funny"" is actually something to aspire to! Anybody I've seen defending the jokes in this have countered it with ""but Star Wars has always had funny lines"" - and NONE of them can tell the difference between the embarrassing 'Amanda Show' style slop we're served up here and Leia referring to Chewie as a walking carpet in anger.

"Star Wars The Last Jedi Is A Fine Movie With Great Visual Effects Great Acting,Things That Made This Movie Fun To Watch But Beyond That To A Star Wars Fan Eyes...Was A Disappointment.2 Years Have Passed Since The Force Awakens Was Released, 2 Years Of Anticipation And Theories About The Backstory Of Some Great Characters That The 7th Film In the franchise brought to us.
The 7th Film Introduced Us To A Very Mysterious Villain Named Snoke Who Had corrupted Ben Solos Mind And Turned Him Into Kylo Ren...But Who Is He?Why Is He So Disfigured?Where Was He When Emperor Palpatine A.K.A Darth Sidious Was in Command?Could He Be His Master Darth Plagueis?Or His Brother Maybe?Or Son?Who Is He???The Answer Is....WHO CARES? He Dies at the Half of The Movie By Kylo Ren, This Mysterious Figure (Who Many Of Us Went To The Cinema Just To Satisfy Our Curiosity About Who He Is) Dies After Almost 20 Minutes Of Screen Time!But Dont Worry Because Dissapointment Doesnt Stop There. Another Character The Force Awakens Brought To Us Was Rey. Rey Had A Very Powerful And Mysterious Connection To The Force That Left Us Wondering About This Connection And Who Were Her Parents, Like Snoke Many Theories Were Out There Like Luke Is Her Father Or She Is Related To Obi-Wan Kenobi.The Answer About Reys Parents Was That Her Parents Were Junk Traders Who Sold Her. I Have Been Waiting 2 Years To Hear This...Really?Where Is The Plot Twist We All Hoped For? Unfortunately Disappointment Doesnt Stop Here.
The Third And My Biggest Disappointment Of This Movie That Made Me So Frustrated Was...Luke Skywalkers Death...Yes He Dies.They Actually Kill The Star Of The Original Star Wars Movies On the Second Movie Of The Trilogy. Yes I Know That We all Believed That He is Going To Die But Not So Soon, I Thought Like Yoda He is Going To Die In The Third Movie Of The Trilogy Not So Soon And The Most Frustrating Thing Its The Way They Kill Him. When Luke Closes His Lightsaber In Front Of Kylo Ren You Are Sure That He is Going To Die (So Yoy Feel Sad about It), Then When Kylo Strikes Him You See That Luke Is Not Physically There And He Is Safe On His Island(So You Feel Happy About It), Then He Dies Because...I Dont Know He Was Spiritually Wounded Or Exhausted? That Made Me Angry Because What Was the Point Of Luke Not Being Physically There If He Is About To Die 2 Minutes Later...He Could Lift His X Wing From The Bottom Of The Sea (A Great Reference To Episode V When Luke Tries To Lift His X Wing) Fight Physically Kylo Ren And Die(He Could Use The Force To Dodge The Bullets...Chirrut Did It).
Another Disappointment Was That There Was Not A Propper Lightsaber Duel. In EVERY Star Wars Movie We See A Jedi And A Sith Striking Each Other With Their Lightsabers. This Movie Doesnt Even Have That. Sure We See Them Killing Some Soldiers With The Lightsaber but Thats It. Even When We See Kylo Ren Vs Luke Skywalker There Is Not An Actuall Lightsaber Battle Because (As Mentioned Before) Luke Is Not Physically There, Is Just Kylo Ren Trying To Hit Luke And Luke Just Dodges His Attacks. This Movie Has Many More Disappointments Like Captain Phasmas Death (Another Character Who Died Too Soon And Without Any Character Development) And More. Of Course It Has Some Cool Stuff Like Great Visuals, Rey And Kylo Ren Working Together, Yodas Force Spirit Advising Luke Of What Is The Purpose Of A Teacher And Encourage Him, Leia Using The Force But These Are Not Enough Unfortunately To Save This Movie.

Star Wars is so ingrained in our culture, so beloved by so many people, I find it's almost become it's own worst enemy.

"It's finally here-- The Last Jedi-- and after two years of waiting, it looks like we got a more than fulfilling result. The film picks up where The Force Awakens ended with Rey, Chewie and R2D2 on Achh-To with Luke and the rest of the Rebels trying to escape from the First Order. It echoes The Empire Strikes Back in some ways, one of them being that it's essentially a story about survival and defence, not attack. The stakes are set high and right from the first scene, we are plunged into action.
The Dark Side, lead by Supreme Leader Snoke is shown getting stronger with each passing second and the Resistance is seen struggling to keep up their fight but hope is kept alive even in the toughest of times. Some early losses in the film set a somber tone and weaken the Resistance fairly, allowing the enemy to take advantage. But the Dark Side isn't perfectly focused either. With an inefficient General and a rather conflicted warrior at the face of it, their decisions don't always seem to be the best (as usual) but due to the sheer power they possess in this film in terms of artillery and manpower, the fight between the two sides makes for an exciting watch. 
Talking about conflict, we see it rising in the minds of almost all of the key characters in the film. The many different layers to everyone's psyche are explored and that's always something to love. Kylo, shown previously being torn between the Light and the Dark and having to carry the burden of being his own father's killer is more disturbed than ever and even Rey, tired of not knowing what her lineage is faces some moments of weakness. To add to this, the two are shown to be ""connected"" by the Force (the reason behind which is later explained) and this just increases the complications. In one rather cathartic scene, we see the possibility of redemption in Kylo but that is short lived and despite an inexplicable bond set up between the two characters, they resume their positions on opposite sides of the battlefield soon afterwards. Luke himself is an old and grumpy man with no interest in what is happening in the galaxy and it takes a fair amount of coaxing and our ever-so-cheeky R2D2, pulling a ""cheap trick"" in a really sweet throwback moment (you'll see), to get him to agree to train Rey. In a later scene, we see another character from the past, a Jedi Master whose name begins with the second last letter of the alphabet, make a small appearance and it warms our hearts to know that everyone and everything really is connected and those ties remain even after the physical selves cease to exist. However there remains a lot of tension in Luke's mind and a whole lot of back-and-forth about whether or not he should involve himself, even if indirectly, in the war again, takes place there. Haunted by what he believes is his failure as a master and his creation, Kylo Ren, he is never fully committed to what he is doing. We are told how Kylo Ren came to be and why he turned to the Dark. But in the end, Luke, very grandly and in a very unique way, regains his place as a Jedi hero.
One of the dialogues in the film where he tells Rey that things are not going to go as planned runs true through every turn of this movie. Learning from The Force Awakens, this plot was created starkly different. Nothing seems to work out and nothing comes easy. The film has three parallel stories-- one with Luke and Rey, one with Finn and Rose Tico and the other with Poe and Leia trying to protect their army and the plans of all of these people fail when they needed to work the most. Even though it rendered the subplots practically useless and is one of the biggest reasons behind the big divide between the fans and the critics about how the film was (the fans disliking the movie, for a change), it's a take that I liked as it made the story seem more real because not everything goes according to plan in life. Rose is a new addition to the cast and is similar to Finn's character in that she too is an underdog who rises to glory through her will. Some other characters should have been given meatier roles like Maz Kanata and Captain Phasma, whose potentials weren't fully tapped. Hopefully the former shows up more strongly in Episode IX. 
One of the biggest questions from the previous installment was about Rey's parents. That is answered but it's not what was expected and even more frustratingly we don't know if it's completely true because we don't see anything play out in any scene, clearly, but instead just hear someone tell her about her family. I wish we'd have been given more of a definite revelation, in this film, like the one from the ""I am your father"" scene from its twin in the original trilogy. If the answer is true however, it would make the 'force' a more open power-- something that can be wielded by anyone and not just a special group of people.
The film has been made funnier than the others in the saga but in just the right way and only when needed. After all, the events are very grave in nature and emotion rules stronger throughout. Since the story references the past more than The Force Awakens, it reminds us of what used to be and how the lives of the people we know have changed and those ignited memories create just the slightest tinge of nostalgia. Every time the Resistance takes a blow and boy do they take a lot of those, it hurts a bit more because it really does feel like we're losing a part of our family and the fact that the dashing Han Solo is missing doesn't help either. One such loss right at the end was especially heartbreaking. Star Wars just isn't Star Wars without some of the characters that have died recently but I guess that's life. Hopefully this person will return as a force-ghost in the last of this trilogy. The death was beautifully sentimental though as it mirrored one of the very first scenes we ever see of this character, symbolically closing the circle of life, so to speak.
The Resistance is left lessened in number but 'reborn' as Luke says in the end. Their future is uncertain but they are safe, for now, and the final showdown in Episode IX will be one for the ages.",0.13728800016183193,0.473825302423433

"The fact that this movie earned a 7 is concerning for me. This is the worst film in the new trilogy by far. While it did encompass many elements that Star Wars fans love while bringing in new and unexpected storylines, those storylines were inadequately written.

 It has the locales, the characters and it brings the environment alive. Watch and you see that rain makes the environment in which the characters live, move. He just adds so much detail, it deepens the viewers investment. That was the magic of the original. It was an escape and not just a movie.

The way Luke was presented was fantastic, very noble like a samurai warrior, much how I've always perceived the Jedi. His sacrifice was legendary to say the least.

"There are three reason why anyone would leave anything above a one star rating for The Last Jedi and here they are as follows. Either the individual has no idea what makes a good film, the individual has been paid off by someone to state that this movie is anything other than complete garbage, or finally, the individual is not an individual at all, but rather a bot programmed to post five star reviews to help push Disney's destruction of the Star Wars legacy. 
 The problem is not just in the fact that The Last Jedi completely destroys what made Star Wars so great, but also in the fact that it is just a bad film, objectively. I mean, it is so bad that it makes the prequels seem good. I know this is being said a lot as of late, but that is literally what I was thinking as I watched this abomination unfold. Boring story and storytelling, old characters being killed off without any real closure (Luke Skywalker), while others are all but completely omitted from the film (R2-D2, C-3PO). New characters added for no other reason than to push new Disney product (i.e. story books being sold at your local Wal-Mart). Feminism and political correctness being thrown in your face and don't even speak to me about the Leia in space scene. 
 I mean it truly felt like I was watching a parody of Star Wars. It was that bad. There is so much more to cover, but if what I'm telling you isn't enough, then I firmly believe that there is nothing that will stop you from seeing what will undoubtedly bring the Star Wars legacy to an absolute halt. I can firmly attest that I will never watch another Star Wars film for the rest of my life. Thanks Disney!",-0.018465909090909085,0.447706228956229

"After the Starkiller base's destruction, the Resistance regroups, knowing the First Order will soon arrive and seek vengeance. As the Resistance fleet is organizing, First Order capital ships arrive. Captain Phasma capably leads a ground offensive against the Resistance base. Nevertheless, the entire Resistance fleet successfully abandon the base and quickly enters hyperspace to their designated rendezvous point. -- Luke accepts the lightsaber (recovered from Cloud City) from Rey, regards it, then hands it back to Rey, stating he's already got one (the one he built himself from ROTJ). Rey updates Luke of the current situation. He knows of the great loss of life as well as the death of Han. Rey was there, and informs Luke that Han died at the hands of his son. Luke is utterly devasted. He has failed to revive the Jedi Order, unwittingly turning Ben Solo to the Dark Side, and yet he has not received guidance from Yoda or Obi-Wan since the end of Battle of Endor. He came to this island to learn more about the Jedi Order past. In deep meditation, he has heard a voice guiding him from time to time, but a voice unfamiliar to Luke. Similar to Obi-Wan's but calmer. There is a place on the island he wishes to show her. He does not seem too surprised that Rey is there and asks her if she knows anything about her parents or her origin. -- Back on the Resistance main ship, Leia, Admiral Ackbar and Poe discuss the next move. The New Republic is destroyed, and no centralized power exists in the galaxy except the First Order. The Resistance can rally the free systems, and they will listen now that the First Order threat is known to all and the Resistance has demonstrated the capacity to disrupt their murderous plans. It is agreed that Leia must personally meet with the most powerful free systems and recruit them to the Resistance cause. The Resistance fleet drops out of hyperspace to begin sending their message to the other systems. Before they can, the First Order fleet arrives and immediately attacks, without deploying their TIE fighters. Also, some of the capital ships of the First Order hyperspace away. This development is baffling to the Resistance leadership. They push back, but while the sensible strategy is to hyperspace again, Admiral Ackbar has a terrible realization. The First Order is following the Resistance fleet through hyperspace! How?! Are they tracking the fleet with a planted subspace beacon? Is there a mole within their ranks giving away their position? Has the enemy broke their communications code? With no other option, Admiral Ackbar communicates a new rendezvous point to the Resistance fleet and orders an immediate re-entry to hyperspace. At that moment, the First Order Capital ships that seemed to have abandoned the battle actually arrive from another point in space, clearly an attempt to block their escape. Luckily, the direction the Resistance fleet seeks to escape is a direction orthogonal to the First Order ship positions (similar to the Millennium Falcon dodge of the Star Destroyers in Empire Strikes Back). The Resistance again enters hyperspace, and the First Order fleet, with Hux knowingly, goes in pursuit. -- Luke takes Rey to a cavern on the island. Luke informs Rey this is the first Jedi temple. A solid wall of black is seen, and the floor is white and circular with a dull gray semicircle near the black wall. Luke says this place is the strongest with the Force he's ever felt, but he cannot determine its purpose. Luke is already standing on the floor, but as Rey steps on the floor, it glows (Bane: Rule of 2). Suddenly, the black wall turns slowly misty white, and from the mist appears Yoda. Luke tells Yoda about his hope to restore the Jedi Order and apologizes for his failure. Yoda tells Luke that the Jedi Order should never be restored, as Yoda has come to realize the failure of the Jedi. Yoda explains that the Jedi Order grew to fear the Dark Side. Hate and anger are of the Dark Side, but so is fear. And pride. The Jedi Order suffered from hubris. Mace Windu appears, telling Luke that the Jedi High Council wore simple robes but sat in a high temple. Jocasta Nu appears, telling Luke the Jedi collected and presumed to have all the wisdom from across the galaxy. Obi-Wan Kenobi appears, saying the Jedi claimed to preserve peace, yet made themselves generals of an army they barely understood or controlled. -- But most importantly, the Jedi neglected to realize the importance of love. The Jedi took children from their family to teach them the Force. But love is a part of the Force, both the light and the dark side. The Jedi failed to see this. But Anakin Skywalker revealed this truth. Anakin turned to the Dark Side because of fear for the death of his mother and wife. Yet, he turned back to the Light Side because of fear for the death of his son. Love, can push a person to the Light side or the Dark Side. Yoda did not realize this until Vader saved Luke from the Emperor. The Jedi took Anakin away from his mother and indirectly pressured him to hide his love for Padme. Luke pushed Anakin back by believing in him when no one else would or even could. (It should be noted that Anakin, himself, did the same for Ahsoka Tano a long time ago.) -- Suddenly, Anakin Skywalker appears, staring intently at Rey. He tells her that her cousin, Kylo Ren, needs to find him and that teaching the Force to others will fall on her and Kylo, and not her father. Anankin looks at Luke, and so now Rey knows who is her father. Luke, confused and frustrated, pleads to know what he is supposed to do. Yoda gestures to another Jedi that has appeared, Qui-Gon Jinn, and tells Luke that Luke has already spent time on this island preparing for his destiny. -- The Resistance is about to come out of hyperspace with a plan to send out multiple capital ships, each with X-Wing fighter escorts. Leia will secretly be on one of the ships. Poe offers to be an escort fighter for her contingent, but Admiral Ackbar also wishes to expel Finn (still recovering from his wounds) on an escape pod. As a former stormtrooper, there may be an undetectable beacon attached to him, even unknowingly to Finn, and Ackbar cannot take the risk of keeping him onboard. Poe argues against this, but the Admiral is understandable determined to send Finn off. Poe then volunteers to take a 2-person fighter and fly Finn himself from the fleet, with BB-8 along for the ride. Ackbar reluctantly agrees to losing his best pilot, given the circumstances. -- The fleet comes out of hyperspace, and deploys the multiple Corellian cruisers from the main flagship (reminiscent of the probe deployment from the ESB opening Star Destroyer scene). Fighters are launched, including Finn/Poe's ship. Quickly, the fleet realizes First Order capital ships are already waiting. It cannot be a subspace beacon the First Order is following, so their communications must have been compromised. This means Finn's expulsion from the flagship is unnecessary, but it is too late to reboard. The Resistance fleet has to adjust course to compensate for the First Order's presence, as the enemy chase fleet arrives. A grand space battle ensues. Seeing the Resistance's actions, Hux realizes this is where the chase ends, so the First Order deploys their fighters. Many Resistance ships are lost, but Finn/Poe/BB-8 are instrumental in Leia's escape. -- Luke and Rey have left the temple. Luke, realizing he no longer needs to be on the island, but also knowing he has no role in re-establishing the Jedi Order, is dejected. Luke is reunited with Chewy and R2-D2 on the island. Rey implores that Luke come with her and join the Resistance. Luke tells her he is an old man and would not be of much use. R2-D2 plays the Leia-Obi-Wan visual to make a point. Yoda Force ghost appears. Chewy says something. Luke is surprised that Chewy seems to recognize Yoda. Yoda encourages Luke to follow his path. Luke thinks this means become Rey's master. Yoda says no. Rey will learn from another. Luke suggests Leia. Again, Yoda corrects Luke. Obi-Wan thought that Luke was the only hope, but Yoda knew there was another. Not Leia, but Ahsoka, the apprentice to Anakin Skywalker. No person knows better the Jedi Order failure than Ahsoka, and she will be the best source of guidance for Rey. Before Rey can find out where this Ahsoka is located, Yoda disappears. -- Luke, Rey, R2-D2 and Chewy board the Falcon and receive a message from Leia saying the Resistance base is being abandoned and given rendezvous coordinates. They embark, not realizing the fleet has been chased away with First Order ships awaiting potential Resistance stragglers. -- Leia's ship comes out of hyperspace. No First Order ships have followed them. The coordinates were secret, even from Poe/Finn, so they are separated from Leia's group. Leia sends word to other powerful free systems for an in-person emergency summit. When asked for a location, Leia simply says that she knows a place. -- Luke and Rey arrive out of hyperspace, and are immediately set upon by First Order ships. Space battle. Luke, using the Force, determines where Leia is located with the aid of some connection related to their mother. The Falcon quickly enters hyperspace to go after Leia. -- Leia is holding an impromptu meeting in the old abandoned palace on Naboo. About a dozen representatives, various races, are seen in a round table headed by Leia. Half seem intent on joining Leia, but another half are reluctant. Some representatives are projections (not in person). Suddenly, a dark, very tall figure is seen approaching from a distance, accompanied by Kylo Ren. One of the in-person representatives welcomes Lord Commander Snoke to the meeting, indicating betrayal and that some of the free systems have already been influenced by the First Order. Leia has miscalculated who could be trusted.",0.05334676552761658,0.4360168554849407

"As the movie follows the adventures of Rey, Poe, Finn, and yes Kylo Ren. We learn that the force hasn't been balanced and the dark side is taking over with the most powerful being in the galaxy being Snoke. The emotions that the movie awakens in the viewer are sometimes upsetting but indeed isn't that one of the strongest emotions, and even anger? As the light side of the Jedi is question, kylo brings the sith into a new perspective, do we really need to define the force as light or dark, isn't it more of a spectrum? Humorism as it's present in this review it's also in the movie, is well timed and respects the overall mood of the movie. The movie is courageous to take the story to somewhere unexpected but end up short because it doesn't take the leap that was really necessary to make the movie a statement of change by the director Ryan Johnson. He didn't let go, to quote Kylo whilst talking to Rey, which I think should have taken the dark path and left us completely in shock; however, that doesn't happen and Rey's character remains emotionally poor, only the relationship with the evil Ren and the old Luke gave her some light as a main character. Every refence is necessary as Yoda tells Luke I say to the fans, always focused on what we dream and want for ourselves, and not on what we actually have. In this case a great new fantasy movie that happens to be a Star Wars movie no one expected to see.",0.05480668756530827,0.5066353187042842
"This movie was a huge disappointment. It was poorly written to say the least, with a scattered and broken story line, and badly timed jokes that didn't fit the feeling of Star Wars. 
Rian Johnson seemed to be writing the characters with the intention of making them look as bad as possible. Most upsetting of all I think was the return of Luke Skywalker, who was not the wise Jedi master we all wanted him to be, but instead was a joke, and then died in a way that didn't seem necessary. Leia did not get the honorable death she deserved (I think it would have been perfect if she had gone in Admiral Holdo's place) Poe was made to look like a selfish fool. Even Rey, who he managed to not ruin, was made to look silly. Kylo Ren was the only character who I didn't disagree with the way he was written, although there was definitely nothing added to his character. 
I thought he killed off way too many people in unnecessary ways, especially new characters who had too much potential. Phasma, who could have lived to be one of the best villains in Star Wars along with Darth Vader and Boba Fett, and after getting her own comic book series and book, was completely wasted in The Last Jedi. Supreme Leader Snoke, who was such a mysterious and intriguing character in The Force Awakens, was quickly killed before he could be fully explored. Holdo I think could have been a really great character in the future, if Leia had died in her place. Lastly, ACKBAR!!!!! Why did he have die?!!! I guess Rian Johnson was just trying to make us feel something to cover up the unmoving story. ",0.04772727272727275,0.5948752228163992

"When the force awakens opened up in cinemas two years ago, I remembered being in awe of the amazing film which essentially carried on the star wars saga.

Complaining that the film was played ""too safe"" and that it ""wasn't original"" or too reminiscent of a new hope...... which I understood to a certain degree, however I felt it was a good way to carry on the franchise nonetheless. When the Last Jedi hit theatres, it took me on a story line which isn't just unpredictable and completely thinks outside of the box in regards to both story line and how characters are introduced. You're invited to new worlds and shown chemistry with new and old characters, basically Disney listened to the fans and gave them something unexpected as well as imaginative...... and surprise surprise, as soon as the last Jedi hits the box office, you're greeted by the same whinge bags who moaned about the force awakens, the same people that said they wanted something different two years ago, are now not happy that the films have gone in a different direction. I don't want to get too much into the film as I want to keep this review spoiler free, but I just wanted to say don't listen to the naysayers, this film is exceptional and is up there with the empire strikes back.....Luke steals the show and watching Poe's character develop is something I didn't know I wanted until I watched the Last Jedi.",0.16369588744588748,0.4995021645021644

JJ Abrams set up a Star Wars trilogy with no idea what the answers to some of the big questions were (who Rey's parents are, Who is Snoke, etc) can you blame Rian Johnson for taking the movie in a different direction.
Out of everything we've seen in Star Wars over the years this movie was probably the most unique, different messages, new sets new ideas the fact that The Firce Awakens was rejected because it was too similar and The Last Jedi was rejected because it was too different is ridiculous. Not every film has to fit YOUR ideals, and just because it was a bit different doesn't make it bad.

The story lines in the movie are exceptional, and they were all easy to follow. It was also enjoyable to get to see more of the characters, especially the different sides of them that really added to the plot. And even though the movie was different, it was not a substantial difference, and the movie shouldn't stray too far from the wishes of most Star Wars fans.

This movie definitely brought out emotions although my only complaint was that it was lacking just a tad bit on the funny side. Other than that it was great. It includes everything a Star Wars fan could possibly want from the light side, to the dark side.

"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an okay film, but it is not a great film. It has scenes that are amazing, boring, and terrible. The entire story with Rose and Finn is worthless. It adds NOTHING! This was such a terrible waste of time that made many of the fans angry with the entire franchise. The death of snoke was a disgrace. He was brought up to be powerful and mighty and dies in such a boring way. Luke's death was dignified. I liked his death, but his character ark throughout the entire movie was not what he was remembered as in the original series. The opening scenes that starts with a prank call ruined the mood. The lightspeed death scene was awesome and beautifully shot. Leia's mary poppins act was awful. The acting was decent. Rose was a terrible character. Kylo Ren was given more backstory and Adam Driver did well as him. The shirtless scene was worthless, though.

It's a visually nice movie, with great action scenes, without any substantial story or logic behind it.

"It's easy to forget that in 1977, Star Wars introduced all sorts of unusual elements and packaged them into an accessible mainstream film. Religion, mysticism, beliefs, strong female characters, banter, humour, flawed characters, failure, the unknown, the unexplained. It deliberately didn't explain everything and it deliberately confounded expectation.
It's pretty depressing seeing the ranks of one star reviews here. It's unusual for so many people to miss so much. 
The Last Jedi definately isn't is a one star film. 
It is also definately not worse than the Phantom Menace, which itself has some good moments. 
I think what people don't like about the last Jedi is that things they wanted to hear explained were not. The film is also quite unusual in its angle, tone and approach. 
The Jedi order was critically deconstructed for our viewing pleasure. 
There were strong female characters throughout, who did not give or get answers, but carried on anyway. 
Some strong male leads were emasculated for our viewing pleasure!
At first I thought the Canto Bight sidetrack was a mistake, but actually, maybe it wasn't.....
There were some bravely intimate and weirdly mystical scenes. Rey in the cave was amazing- a bit of Ingmar Bergman creeping in. 
The close up face shots were really compelling. I haven't seen a mainstream film recently where an actor has to face act in close up for extended periods (Ridley and Driver manage this really well). Again, it was like Ingmar Bergman!
In fact, the film is unusual in that a strange surreal atmosphere hung over it, almost building to unexplained foreboding. 
Kylo Ren was amazing, especially with Snope gaslighting him to make him more angry, just as Rey discovered more by Skywalker refusing to engage with her. 
The scene where Ren focuses everything on Skywalker, like a furious Don Quixote trying to attack a windmill is memorable. 
There were certainly a few tense Serge Leone stand offs in the film. The Rey / Ren fight scene is probably the most intense in the Star Wars series. 
All the time, the rule book was being torn up. Often, we were made to laugh at the points where the rule book went up in smoke (in one case literally).
I was really happy with this film, I think it went back to the fact that we have forgotten that the original Star Wars was weird, intense, unsettling,unusual and original- unlike anything else that came before. 
As far as I am concerned, Episode 7 was back to basics and getting us back on track. Rogue One began to blow the dust off the franchise, and Episode 8 has continued with this and thrown everything up in the air. 
And yes. There are clearly alot of people who don't get it. And it's all the better for that. Because, as hinted at in the film, there will be kids who watch, who will get it and will be blown away, like when the original was released.",0.1497175141242938,0.5651129943502824

The Last Jedi is astounding; Rian Johnson has done an admirable job. It's the first Star Wars movie with nuance and has genuine character development. Every shot means something to the greater whole of the movie and Johnson's approach fixes a lot of the force issues that Lucas introduced in the prequels. The middle section is a little long and doesn't add much to the overall plot and this is my only minor gripe. Stay the course because the final third of the film delivers with pay off after pay off. I'm upset audiences seem to have quite juvenile issues with this chapter because Star Wars need this - it needed a re-interpretation and re-imagination; it needed an auteur like Johnson tackling its mythology and 40 year characters because you simply cannot have episode after episode of the same thing repeated over and over. Thank you Rian Johnson for a movie with feeling and originality and for making The Last Jedi the 3rd best Star Wars movie (after 4 & 5).,0.12440476190476189,0.3428004535147392

First off, this movie was a wonderful experience, there is absolutely no doubt about that and the positives far outweighed the negatives. Having said that the negatives that were, were all related to the general story arc and unfortunately pretty significant. There also seem to be a general trend in Hollywood that we need more humor and self-depreciation in movies nowadays, which proved valuable in films like Ant-man, Deadpool and especially Guardians of the Galaxy, but which went for example completely overboard in Ragnarok, making it a painful slap-stick mess.

Luke is an idiot. Better saying, this is not Luke, but Jake Skywalker as Mark Hamill wisely said. And then he dies. Without a real reason for it!
Rey is so boring, so... And she is not a Skywalker! So, what about her? They tell us just nothing! 
And... Do you think snoke is a great Sith Lord? No, he is no powerfull as you thought! And he got killed just in this movie, which is supposed to be the middle of the trilogy! And the bad guy is already dead! It looks like a joke! And speaking about jokes, all the movie is a joke. Jokes and a forced humor is the only thing the author of this trash cares about. Jokes.

"For the past week I was struggling with myself. I had a very important decision to make. And now that I decided, I'm feeling relieved. I finally decided to not watch The Last Jedi on the cinema. And I don't know if I'll watch it on DVD or Blu-Ray or Netflix or whatever... It was not an easy decision but I know it was the right one. I already know what happens on the film and I don't want to see those things happening with my own eyes. I don't want to see Luke milking an alien cow, I don't want see him denying his nature, I don't want to see him desisting his life and dying in the first film he appeared after more than 30 years, I don't want to see Leia flying like an old and pathetic version of Supergirl, I don't want to see a villain that dies in his second film, I don't want to see the ridiculous Marvel kind of humor in a so called Star Wars film, I don't want to see an unknown boy with a broom, and I don't want to see new characters with zero charisma. Two years ago I left the cinema feeling sad and empty. There was a big hole in my chest. I felt that I watched a film but this was not the saga I love. It was not part of it. And this new one is even worse!
The sad reality we all have to face is: Disney's focus are not the real fans of the saga. Those who love it and understand it. Those who really care about the meaning of the saga, the meaning of those characters including the prequel's characters. Disney's focus is to target the new generation and the general public to sell toys and games and make lots and lots of money with NO story, NO plot, NO Star Wars soul. This is not Star Wars it's Star Wa...lt Disney! It's something different! For a different public. 
We can see that the first six films form a saga. There is a huge connection between them. They have a meaning, a purpose, a reason to exist. They came from the mind of a man who knew what he wanted to tell, he had a story about a Father and his children, a story of redention. He could make some tings that some people would love or not but it was HIS saga! And now we realize that the saga doesn't exist anymore. Disney is really trying to fool us all! But the real fans won't buy it! 
By reading the comments of those who like this film we see that most of them are general public. They say: ""I know nothing about Star Wars, but I like the film"", or ""I like Star Wars but I'm not a huge fan"". They also say: ""This is only a film"". NOOOOO, it's not only a film! It was supposet to be Star Wars, and Star Wars has not been only a film (or only films) for decades!
So, we have to face the sad truth about Disney intentions, but we don't have to agree or accept it!
As long as we keep going to the cinemas and giving them our money, they will continue making their Star WaltDisney for kids and for entertaining people and making money. They don't take Star Wars seriously. We do! So, let's stop going to the cinema! Let's not watch this film. Let's not watch the next film (no matter if it's JJ doing the next, he is the one who started to screw SW with that empty The Force Awakens)!

"The thing is, I couldn't find a correct critic, because the movie we talk about, is Star Wars, so it can only be super good or super bad. Let me share my own thoughts about The Last Jedi. (No spoilers, HOWEVER I DO SUGGEST EVERYONE, TO WATCH THE MOVIE WITHOUT CRITICS, AND OTHER'S JUDGMENTS):
Things that were bad:
I think we can put the ""A little bit too much"" label on almost everything, which sadly makes the movie line a little bit jumbled. For example: 1) More characters then it was necessary, and I think they should have give us a deeper knowledge about fewer of them. 2) I also think there was a little bit too much action. Personally, I'd like if the story sometimes just chill a little in the neighboring tavern, or dance with the aliens at Jabba's... 3) A little bit to much moral messages, dramatic moments, but that's also cool at some point 4) A little bit too many adorable... things :D 5) And I'm sure most of you have already guessed this one is coming: Too much jokes. No. No ""little bit"" here... I mean there were a lot of good jokes, funny moments, which were all in all good, but some times it has no other effect on me, but ruining the dramatic moments, or making me feel embarrassed, uncomfortable. These things has their place in Marvel movies (which by the way I like very much) but not here, and especially not at these moments. It's a waste... without them, it could easily get 9, I may even consider the legendary 10. Why?
The good things:
1) I don't care how many people disappointed in some of the characters but most of them were awesome. Especially (!) those who could use the force. Everything has a meaning on that story line, every character did his or her part magnificently. Everyone had a little dark and light inside of them, and I really think it is a very good message. Even Luke's character became more complexed that way, and yes I liked it it very much. I even accepted that Rey has a base knowledge of the force without training. (Based on episode 7, no spoilers) First of all, she had a raw talent of using it, which I can accept. Second of all I realized it, that she already learnt sword fighting so she might be able to handle a lightsabre. And Kylo Ren was simply amazing. 2) The fighting scenes and battle scenes were truly monumental 3) We have seen many things from the Star Wars universe, which are only known by the gamers, or even new elements, and they were fantastic, I loved to see these things on the movie screen. 4) I think all the jedi got back their long missed dignity and mystery I always thought they should have before the prequels.

"The movie smacks of political correctness and inclusiveness buzzwords of contemporary American society racial and cultural identities. The introduction of the short chubby Asian female and the African-American actor who plays the ex-storm trooper as sub-plots further heightens the notion of an ongoing theme to incorporate aspects of American society into the Star Wars trilogy films. I might please American audiences but overseas might not have the same appeal. But an otherwise all-Caucasian characters would be really controversial in the current social climate. Also noteworthy are the British accents of some of the especially Imperial characters. The Star Wars film characters and plots were always inspired by and adapted from previous elements of American society right from the original Episode IV. Location shooting introduces nothing new from the last film Luke is still away on his little island home although the introduction of maintenance worker creatures and the little bird-like big eye animals is questionable to the story development. Those old enough to remember the entire series since 1977 will be reminded of their age especially when looking at General Leia and Luke in their very apparent older years. Given that Carrie Fisher actress has now died we would expect her to be killed off in this sequel but apparently not so. As always, great space battle special effects and well choreographed fight scenes does not disappoint.

"While I am not going to go so far as to say that The Last Jedi was a terrible movie, I do think it failed in basically every way to capitalize on what I thought was an extremely well done ""reboot"" of the series in the Force Awakens. Yes, JJ Abrams relied heavily on nostalgia and a near retelling of the original movie to bring us back to the universe far, far away, but he did it in a way that you KNEW he was honoring something that needed to be planted correctly after the near abominations that were the prequel movies. 
The idea that this was being marketed as the best movie since Empire is laughable. The tension of the Force Awakens is eradicated in mere minutes. The humor is cheap, jarring and unbefitting a saga which gave us the wit of Han Solo. The fantastic characters and their storylines from TFA are cheapened in a way that there were entire subplots that could have been dropped. There were miscasts, reminiscent of Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu. The handling of Luke's Grand re-entrance, while there were some savory moments, was at least a partial dud. The biggest flaw of all was the way that they kept playing with a plot twist that never materialized. 
This is obviously my own opinion. There are some redeeming qualities to the film such as the cinematography and some epic space battles (and Rey is always phenomenal). I still really appreciate the actors from TFA, even though I felt like they were done a disservice by the director. All-in-all, I am happy that JJ Abrams will be back to helm Episode 9.

Although watching a second time the message becomes clearer, it's like my eyes have been opened. Last Jedi is a story about finding place in the Universe, and the journey of finding yourself along the way, that answers to these questions are not easy. 
And how others actions inspire the next generation to come without being forgotten. 
It's message and Reys Destiny are very much the same. If Luke had returned to the Resistance/Rebellion to fight again that would have been predictable, Luke got himself out of the way from the galaxy, because he thought it was the best thing to do. 
But his actions actually inspire others to do better. 
It's a different kind of Star Wars film that we've never seen before, it's very cool and very new.

Yes Disney has pimped out the saga to the whims of writers who do not embody the true spirit of the Star Wars saga and the fans who have made it successful all these years. I was disgusted and left the theater when Leia and Vice Admiral Holdo mock the hallmark of Star Wars, ""May the force be with you...always!"", by laughing about it when they say it at the same time. Reckless and unacceptable in any context and disrespectful to the Saga and the fans who made Star Wars what it is today. And to the writer....anybody can plagiarize a script by putting the plot of A New Hope, Return of the Jedi and the Empire Strikes back in one movie. Please do us a favor and write yourself out of the script like Han Solo or Luke Skywalker since it obvious you are resentful against what made Star Wars successful.

In the mean time we kill off another leading male role Luke Sky Walker, man what a pile of crap!

"The director's efforts to shake things up and make something new aside, the twisting of Luke Skywalker's character is unforgivable. That the man who would never give up on the light inside Darth Vader, who being the chosen one with countless deaths on his shoulders would have a far deeper and more powerful darkness inside him then a budding Ben Solo would, would go to confront Ben, at night, carrying a light saber, while Ben slept, is preposterous! He would have gone calmly, with love and light in his heart, and a determination to bring Ben to the light (as he did with his father). Everything else that was done with Luke's character was based on a behavior that he would never in a million years engaged in! I have never been more disappointed in my life with a plot-line or a director's handling of a character. And he has effectively taken away any chance that those of us who waited 30+ years to see the awesomeness of what Luke represented and had become would look like.

But that is not outsmarting the audience when the tricks makes no sense. The last scene of the Force Awaken is an example. It setup this movie with a question I think most of us wanted to see an answer. Instead Luke plays it off for a laugh by doing something I could not imagine. If I'm not mistaken he inherited the lightsaber from Obi Wan and it belong to his father that he went through hell to save. He lost an arm with that lightsaber. And he just chunks it? Zero sense.

"The Last Jedi is genuinely a great movie. I don't understand why many people disrelish this film. First of all, The Last Jedi has astonishing and paramount themes. I don't optate to spoil the film but it edifies us a great edification about failure. We all can learn a thing a two. Rian Johnson is an astonishing film maker and he did do equity with this film. We fail, our heroes fail, no one is impeccable. We all make mistakes and we can learn from them. The Last Jedi withal had phenomenal acting, an astonishing plot, fantastic cinematography, wondrous fighting sequences, great themes and it left us hopeful at the cessation. Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley additionally did an astonishing portrayal of their characters. I inculpate the people who misprized this film were the downfall of The Rise of Skywalker. The studio and executives got trepidacious of verbalizing risks so they made Episode IX Frankenstein's monster of a film. I dote The Last Jedi because it was not trepidacious to take risks and I veraciously believe that it paid off. I ken for a fact that Russian Cyber-farms heavily influenced many Star Wars fans to hate this film. Even if some TLJ detesters weren't manipulated, those ones just hate change. Change was additionally an astounding theme of The Last Jedi.

"The amount of negative reviews is getting ridiculous. Ryan Johnson made one of the best films in SW-franchise and very decent piece of cinematography. His approach is actually quite close to that of George Lucas. SW began as independent film, bold and experimental, and Lucas always held to that, in prequels too, inspite of all the critic from old fans. Here, with Ryan Johnson, we see the same boldness, the same readiness to explore and invent something new. The so called Canon, set of immutable laws - as it always happens, not only on SW, but in life, - in public reception replaced that what gave life to the series in the first place - and that is imagination.
Last Jedi is surprising, - it always goes not the way you think, with several major unpredictible twists, - fascinating and emotionally engaging, with accent on charachter development - which, again, was one of the main traits of Lucas's films.
The metamorphose of Luc is actually the only logical explanation of his exile - how else would you explain his abandonment of all the people he cared about? It is guilt, that is rationalized through his critic of the Jedi way as such.
Episode with Leya in space was a little over the top, but - especially in the sad context of this movie being Carry Fisher's last appearance - it played beautifully and moving.
The logic of the chase scene is explained in the movie and makes sense, I don't understand the critic here.
The whole Monte-Carlo sequence is overextended, it was made to explore the characters of Finn and Rose, but it introduces two important charachters - DJ, who is great in his opposition of the classic good-bad-guy Han Solo, being bad-bad-guy, and the boy who played a significant symbolic role in the end of the film.
The whole un-answering-the-big-questions thing, that irritated the fans the most - is due to the fact, that Johnson shifted the accent towards the psychological exploration of the characters, sometimes at the expense of the plot development.
This movie certainly has its flaws, but overall it doesn't deserve all this reactionary and irrational hatred that it received from fans. Mainly because it didn't resort to being the simple fan-service attraction (which you could have expected from Disney), instead being a decent stand-alone inovative and imaginative movie in SW universe.",0.17569352416291192,0.48111803162823574
"I am all for diversity. I cheered with my daughters for Rey in Force Awakens. Her character was developing nicely and we rooted for her in the last movie. In this movie she is a sad shell of herself from the first movie. She does nothing we liked. The interaction with Kylo Ren though interesting did not make sense. He killed his father in front of her and now she wants to save him a few days or week later. We don't buy that plot. The line about Kylo being shirtless was cringe worthy. Leia all of sudden showing Super Woman flying in space powers was cringe worthy. The Rose character acting like a fan girl who is strict to do her duties is a poor Asian girl stereotype my daughters did not appreciate. Haldo acts like a women who has to prove herself by putting men down. That is not how females in leadership positions much less military high rank act. Haldo's stereotype is almost as bad as Rose's. The rest of the movie plots are forgettable. We lost interest in Star Wars after this movie. The humor were funny at times but this did not feel like a Star Wars movie.

They should have killed her off to give the viewers a break, because we all know that they will try to CGI Leia in the next film, or hopefully have her in an off screen death, escaping trying to show her in the next film. I also thought they missed an opportunity with Kylo Ren and Leia. They could've shown that Leia did not die at the hands of Kylo, but of the First Order. I also though that Luke was very whiny, even though he is the greatest jedi who has ever lived. I even find him to not be his character at all. Luke is supposed to be this person that sees the good in everyone, even in Darth Vader. But in The Last Jedi, it shows him igniting his lightsaber on a small Kylo, totally bypassing his original character mental process of seeing the good in everyone. I was also hoping for more character development for Snoke, but apparently killing him off seemed like the right thing to do. He is such a rich character, but no effort was made into showing who is actually is. It looks like we have to wait for the Knights of Ren for another whole year of two.

They also break the flow of everything that was set in motion in the episode, The Force Awakens:
The promise of a new lead that takes over Luke in the first series and Anakin in the second. Rey that was such a powerful character in The Force Awakens seems to have lost her clout in the second. The love plot fizzles out. We see no remnants of the Republic that was supposed to have flourished after return of the Jedi. The training of Rey is nothing compared to that of Luke in the Empire strikes back and does not have the many spiritual layers that were laid.

The entire plot line with Fin and the Asian girl added nothing to the movie and basically could have been left on the editing room floor.

There are some cool scenes but the movie jumps from one scene to the other so quickly that the viewer doesn't have time to absorb it fully. It's like this movie was created for an ADD kid, the Millennial generation. Also, there is a lot of misplaced humor, inserted into serious scenes inappropriately, and then just ignored for the remained of the scene. IMHO, this is sign of an inexperienced director that was not ready for such an undertaking.

"In some respects, reviewing this film seems like a waste of time because the whole franchise is Marmite. (For my non-UK readers, Marmite is a strong, yeast based spread which ""You either love it or hate it"" and nothing will change your views).
I freely admit to being a hard-core fan since I was in New York when the first film opened as saw it on Times Square in its first week.
After seeing this tale from the series, I was left feeling conflicted. There is something missing from the spirit of the film, which I think I have identified.
What is present is an atmosphere of foreboding. Part of this is the realisation that Carey Fisher will not be in any further films, but also that the story is losing itself in a circle of plot clichés.
So what is missing? Joy. 
The simple, innocent joy, that in the eternal fight of good vs evil, knowing that good will always be triumphant.

On the other hand, as a Star Wars fan, I was deeply disappointed. After waiting two years since The Force Awakens, and thirty some odd years since The Return of the Jedi, the movie failed to deliver on some key moments we were hoping for.

"I am a huge Star Wars Fan and I love the Universe created by Lucas. I like the prequels, I liked TFA and I loved Rogue One. I saw the TLJ at the midnight premiere in London. I had a ticket for the screening in 3.30 in the morning. After seeing TLJ I was so frustrated that I did not attend the second screening. 
There were so many problems with this movie and I felt so disappointed. I will try to summarise some of the problems:
1. The whole space chase. Apparently the director is not quite familiar with the Star Wars universe even though that he guessed correctly the need for bombers in the first space battle. There are capital ships like the star destroyers but there are smaller ship like the Tie fighters/bombers. So far the First order is not shown to have tie bombers but it is logical that they should have a ship playing this role in a battle. If there isn't than we assume that the Tie fighters have the same role. Why do you have to chase the ship in stead of attacking it with the Tie Fighters/Bombers. Or make a small jump and surround the ship? I will buy the director and the whole story group a drink if they can explain this nonsense.
2. Luke could not attack his father but would kill Kylo Ren in his sleep - I don't believe it. I think Mark Hamill was so pissed off by the script that he did not agree to take part in Episode 9 and that is why they had to kill him. 
3. This movie felt like it was made for children. It was like a Star Wars parody, so many unnecessary jokes. Like I was watching Thor Ragnarok or Pirates of the Caribbean. I am sorry Disney but Star Wars was never meant for children. That is why I do not like SW Rebels as much as I did the Clone Wars.
4. TFA did not sell well in China. Problem solved! We need to add some Chinese actors. Finn was better with Poe as boyfriend than this. You fall in love for what - 1 day??? This Rose was so annoying. 
5. Supreme leader Joke and Phasma were so underdeveloped as characters. If the leader was so powerful why not sense Kylo's intentions. It felt like the director did not like JJ''s character and decided to dump him.
6. Yoda was terrible and he looked like he was on crack.
7. Rey did not have any sword training but she defeats three of Snokes bodyguards who were supposed to be the best of the best in sword fight as they did not have force powers?
8. The whole Canto Blight scene was so unnecessary and dull. The whole political correctness of the movie was so obvious and appalling. 
9. The admiral did not tell the plan to her subordinates? WTF? The whole Resistance looked awkward as a bunch of idiots who don't know what to do.
10. John Williams was completely wasted. I did not remember a single scene where the music was inspiring.
11. This movie felt incomplete. Like all the games lately where you need to buy a bunch of DLCs to get the whole story. I am pretty sure that the same is happening here just to squeeze more and more money from the trademark. Probably we will have a book where Snoke story will be told. 
12. Weak dialogues - you've seen them all...
There are so many more examples but the most annoying thing is that I believe TLJ is destroying some of the fundamentals of the Star Wars Universe which I cannot accept and will never accept. I am actually really glad that JJ Abrams will direct Episode 9 and I hope he will be able to repair some of the damage done to the Universe that I love so much. He might even resurrect Snoke like they did with Darth Maul.

"The visuals were great but I just couldn't get over how ridiculous is the whole attitude towards time and space in this movie. 
1. People just jump on an off stars and galaxies like they go for the store for a carton of milk. Everything is instantaneous. Distance is meaningless.
2. In the future we have robots doing everything but we still need a human to hold the wheel of every starship, from the smallest fighter to the largest cruiser. In one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie the rebels are leaving their cruiser but an Admiral ""has to stay and navigate the ship"" because...what? It will hit a tree or a mailbox if they left the wheel? 
3. Of course every battle has to be in eye range contact. Bombs are being dropped like it's WW2.
4. Also: Kylo Ren or whtever his name is is as intimidating as your annoying Emo neighbor. Good villains are either murderous death machines like Hulk (if Hulk was a villain) or cold an calculated like most good villains out there.

But while The Force Awakens was about trying to live up to and recapture that legacy, The Last Jedi is about learning to move on from it and become your own thing while still respecting the original legends that inspired you in the first place. Characters are given fascinating and unique story arcs that manage to subvert expectations while still delivering thematically satisfying conclusions. The story explores aspects of the Star Wars universe that I never really thought about before, but now want to see get explored more in dozens of new stories.

The lack of story is painfully obvious when everything just passes by like some sort of arcade game, they could have shortened the movie considerably and noone would have missed the cut out parts.
The acting is just bad, I guess Benicio does perform in some way, but his ticks are just completely unnecessary and contributes nothing since he is a nobody and just passes by in the movie as someone.
Spaceballs had more depth, better acting, interesting character builds and it was actually funny, but it was a parody of Star Wars.

When I saw the disparity between the glowing professional reviews and the damning fan reviews I expected to side with those who hated the film but in the end I thought the good FAR outweighed the bad. Yes, it suffered from lots of cringe inducing over-the-top moments, some generic Marvel-esque production values at points, and 45 minutes of distracting subplot, but it's core (the other 105 minutes which contained the major plot points) was magic, the simple and elegant story of Luke Skywalker and his two students, one representing momentous regrets and the other representing the possibility of redemption.

Positives first: the actors were really good, Hamill, Ridley, Finn, Poe, Fisher, Driver, they all gave it all they had. Good score, good special effects, it ""looked"" and ""sounded"" like Star Wars (except Yoda).
Now the negatives, in no particular order.
All the things we have believed in, from 1977 until Force Awakens and Rogue One, have all gone down the pan.
Not just destroyed, but declassified, ridiculed, dragged through mud!
The Force requiring long training, dedication, the path of a Jedi, etc? Nah, all nonsense.
Yoda's teachings, 800 years of respected career? Down the drain.
The mysterious Snoke, is he Sidious? is he Darth Plagueius? Is he Sypho Dyas? Is he Mace Windu? 
Nah, just some punk who cannot even tell he is being conned in the most childish way.
The fact that Rey (and to a lesser extent even Finn) were able to do Force things, wield a lightsaber, give the (Skywalker, full of Midichlorians, fully trained by Luke first and then Snoke), sure they must have some special lineage, sure there must be some big surprise in store?
Nah, nothing of the sort. The Force is clearly something you can get at the Disney store with your Mickey ears and your Goofy hat.

"All in all The Last Jedi is another triumph for the franchise, but one can't help but wonder if it could have been written neater to seem less like 3-4 episodes of a TV show and more like an actual movie. For a film that runs so incredibly long it sure as hell doesn't address quite a few plotholes either. We still have no idea who, how or where Snoke came to be or who the alleged ""Knights of Ren"" are that Kylo took with him in his rebel against Luke. It also has time to create new plotholes like how did Rei suddenly become so adept with a Lightsaber when Luke literally taught her no combat skills or why is Finn still considered a main character? It fails as a sequel in the sense where it races to tell us more before resolving questions inspired from it's predecessor. This isn't to say The Last Jedi is 152 minute failure though, in fact outside of the former problems mentioned I think it did an exceedingly great job bringing new character ideas and story elements into the franchise. Especially the relationship between Kylo and Rei as they walk parallel with each other in discovering their connection/role with the Force. A lot of the subplots went beyond expectations because it's arguably there just so there's epic Sci-Fi battles to be had (A necessity in a Star Wars film, no?) I was really impressed with how much newcomers Dern (Admiral Holdo) and Tran/Ngo (Rose and her sister) quickly became favorites on screen. I stepped out of the theater exhausted but still pretty satisfied with my Star Wars experience. Like The Force Awakens there's a lot of nodding to existing lore in the franchise and a lot of new stuff to sink your teeth into, I just wish it was written and presented more efficiently. There seems to be a lot of the general negativity from fanatics. They're probably just unhappy with where they're taking the story or certain characters, it's unfortunate but loyalists will always hold onto that sense of entitlement.",0.1152714402714403,0.48330505830505827

"Really people? Saying you're not going to see another Star Wars movie? Get a life in all honesty. The fact that we're all still here seeing Star Wars movies literally 40 years after the original came out is evidence enough that we are all going to continue to accept anything that is thrown at us. And, in addition to that, we have lived through some pretty rough Star Wars moments: the ewoks. The special editions (don't even get me started on the song ""Jedi Rocks."" Also, Vader screaming ""NO"" as he throws the Emperor into the reactor shaft is one of the worst scenes in cinematic history. It literally killed the climax of the original trilogy). THE FREAKING HOLIDAY SPECIAL!!!!!! Ewok tv shows. The Phantom Menace. The abysmal CGI in Attack of the Clones. Anakin and Padme's romance. Padme dying from a broken heart. The Clone Wars movie (not the TV show. The show is incredible). We are going to live through all of these things, and yet people are still going to complain because they didn't like the explanation about Rey's parents or the fact that they made a new plot and Kylo Ren doesn't just come back to the light like Vader did, but instead kills his master and becomes an even greater villain than he already was. 
Is this movie perfect? Absolutely not, but what movie is. You can even look at some of the best rated movies of all time and they are not perfect. Did I love every second of this movie? Not entirely. Finn and Rose's story wasn't the best. Phasma still sucks. But, LUKE FREAKING SKYWALKER??? He literally did things with the force that no one had ever imagined was possible before! Crashing a rebel cruiser through a Star Destroyer at light speed? Such an incredible scene. The awesome WWII style bombers that take out the dreadnought are amazing. Rian Johnson, while not a perfect script writer, did an amazing job with this movie. In his defense, there are a lot of new characters in this new trilogy and he did a great job of trying to balance the old and the new.
Finally, all of you naysayers are probably just the people who could only find one major complaint with The Force Awakens: it's similar to a New Hope. So your major complaint about a very well executed movie is that it's similar to literally the first blockbuster of which it is a sequel? Furthermore, you criticized the prequels for being too different. And for anyone who's saying it's a carbon copy of IV, I'd like to ask, ""Where's the second sun on Jakku? Where is this mystical missing Jedi that they're searching for in New Hope?"" The similarities are there, don't get me wrong, but they are 2 seperate movies. And can you blame Johnson for taking risks? Abrams got ripped apart for not being original enough. So Johnson does what people wanted and creates a new story that phases out the old Star Wars gradually while bringing in the new generation of heroes.

The runtime is too long and the movie isn't engaging enough to keep you paying attention. There are some subplots that erase every perception I've had about some characters in The Force Awakens, by which I mean if before going watching TLJ, I liked Rey, for example, and now I just don't care for her anymore. I think it's worth saying that there are many inconsistencies in the writting of ST characters in TFA and TLJ, whoch doesn't make sense given these movies span two-three days. 
As an addition, I loved porgs. They were a merchandising addition and it pains me to adimit that Dinsey has given them a more consistent treatment than any hero/villain in the movie. Without detailing any further, this movie feels like erasing in a bad manner any mistery/curiosity TFA has created in me.

It starts with showing how weak heroes can be, and they make bad choices, but when they do the right thing they will become legend through their sacrifice. Then there is the concept that sometimes people do things totally useless due to misunderstanding, then there is disagreement and disobedience in the rebellion leadership (the strange thing is that there was none in the original trilogy).

"Coming off the Force Awakens the Previous film in the Skywalker Saga which released in 2015 was left off with big questions like Why was Luke Hiding, Who is Snoke, Who are Rey's Parents, some are answered while some are thrown away wasted. Mark Hamill Performance as Luke Skywalker is the best it has ever been with a Luke who is shamed off himself and want's nothing to do with the Jedi while the other highlight performance's are Daisy Ridley as Rey, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, Oscar Isaac as Poe, (Etc.) after the unfortunate death of Carrie Fisher of the End of 2016 left us with her last Performance as General Leia which also her best performance. Rian Johnson had an interesting story with loads of twist and turns that not all fans will be happy with (Spoiler Alert) Death of Snoke and Luke Skywalker who would of been big players in the final film of the Skywalker Saga he also delivered very powerful emotional moments. My Problems with this film are that Force Awakens and Last Jedi feel so different to each other because this film continue's where Force Awakens Left off but there some bits that do not connect, Another Problem I had was the waste of character's like Snoke in Episode 7 looking so Scary and interesting powerful character and hoped to have learnt more about him and we didn't and was defeated so easily and also the Finn and Rose (Canto Bight) storyline did nothing to the overall story and finally the final problems I had was that Han Solo died in Starkiller Base by his Son Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) and which they do not address or mention anything about apart from Luke who asked where's Han (in a Deleted scene Luke mourns Han's Death) but not in the Movie (WHY) it would of adding more emotional to the film and deleted scenes that couldn't of been in the movie (Luke mourns Han's Death, Lesson 3, Finn Up to Date, BB 8 Reveals Rey's Goodbye, Rose Bites Hex) why delect those scenes

"I felt compelled to create an account and write a review on here following the negative backlash this film has received. To put things into context, I've been a die hard Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember. I still have Dark Forces II and Republic Commando installed on my laptop, and yes, I still watch Star Wars Rebels. That being said, I still recognize and criticize the flaws I see. The prequels are nostalgic to me and I still love parts of them, but overall they're hugely flawed, from script to acting to an abundance of poor CGI. Rogue One was great, yet lacking in any real semblance of character development or depth and TFA was just a rehash of A New Hope. I was then surprised to see the reception this film has got from other lifelong fans of the series, who like me criticized the cliched path TFA took. It surprised me, because this film did the complete opposite. Johnson has given us a film that's gone against the now predictable formula of the films before it. Spoilers follow as I feel they're necessary to convey the way I felt about this film. I've seen the Last Jedi twice now and actually liked it even more the second time round. The shocking death of Snoke was a fantastic choice, it stopped us from having another Emperor Palpatine and portrayed the opportunistic and emotionally rooted Dark Side perfectly. Rey not having any famous parents is greater still, working brillianly in conjunction with one of the films many messages of trying to live up to a legacy. (I'm confused as to why everyone wanted the same story as the originals and the prequels again.) With regards to the plot, the film is about the characters themselves growing, and even though I agree that the Finn/ Rose plotline felt out of place on first viewing, I don't think that gives anyone any real justification to rate the film 1 or 2 stars out of 10. The characters in this film were done beautifully. Mark Hamill was amazing as Luke, a deeply flawed hero of sorts who regretted this one split second decision he thought about for a 'fleeting moment'. Ridley was much better than in TFA, playing this confused learner, 'trying to find her place in all this', drawing a lot of parallels with Luke in ESB. Driver was fantastic too, along with all of the other now familiar faces. The music was stunning, far better than TFA, my hat goes off yet again to John Williams. Hearing the Tie Fighter Attack music from a New Hope as Chewie slides the Falcon through the crystal caves of Crait gave me goosebumps. Everything was filmed beautifully, even the action scenes; a rare thing nowadays. The throne room scene has the best filmed action scene of any Star Wars film in my opinion; brutal fast paced and without the stupid spinning of the prequels. All in all the Last Jedi is my favourite film of the year. It had flaws in it's humour at points and I felt the Finn subplot could have been improved on, but everything from the acting, the directing, the script and the music to the beautiful send off for Luke was fantastic. I know you guys are all going to downvote this to oblivion, feel free to if it makes you feel better about yourself.

Faithful to star wars lore. Yes the jedi ""bible"" states you can force project for those powerful enough. As for no snoke development. . .did we see that with jaba the hut initially? did we see it for Boba Fett? No, but there was a mystique about the characters that kept our imaginations alive.

I enjoyed the very realistic image of men vs women in this movie, which is that we are equally strong in most areas (Kylo Ren/Rey), but different in others (more physical strenght in men, Rey/Snoke, more empathy in women Leia - Holdo - Rose). Poe Dameron clearly (mis)judges Vice Admiral Holdo by her ultra feminine looks, but Leia doesn't scold him for being male, she scolds him for being rash, for 'jumping into an X-wing'. She would have said the same thing to a rash female character like Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica. So men shaming is a totally biased perception here. On the contrary, when Poe isn't listening to their conversation any more, both women express their appreciation for him. There was no negativity in their laughter, only a recognition between women in charge that for the X-th time in their lives, a testosterone driven man has questioned their authority... Or do you think Poe Dameron would have questioned Holdo's decisions in the same way if she had been portrayed as a 60 year old male (e.g. a captain Kirk figure) ?

It's difficult to argue why I lived this movie so much without spoilers, but I'll simply say that this film managed to combine character growth, new character introduction, with some great action and world building.

"The Last Jedi in one word was stunning. The movie had everything that you'd expect from a Star Wars film, in fact a lot more. It was fast-paced with incredible plot twists and a jaw dropping action sequence involving Kylo and Rey. The movie also explored a lot of mature topics such as the conflict within one's self or even the bad consequences of crony capitalism in a galaxy far, far away. The occasional puns although childish did not undermine the dark tone of the movie. The movie took many bold steps and pushed a lot of boundaries but it paid off handsomely. The movie's message was very clear. This is a new generation of Star Wars and it is going to be unpredictable yet thrilling and that is what I loved the most about it. 
Snoke's portrayal was unimpressive and his death was anti-climatic. Rian Johnson managed to ridiculously destroy his air of darkness (by dressing him up in gold). Finn and Rose's adventure on Canto Bight added a new dimension to the story but John Boyega and Kelly Marie Tran barely have any on-screen chemistry and their cheesy dialogues only make it worse. Also the fuel crisis situation was too long drawn and became boring at times. A few characters like Captain Phasma had unsatisfactory story arcs. These among a few other inconsistencies here and there did not take much away from the film though.

"This is my first and probably last review, simply because this was the only movie franchise that i truly cared about. After seeing ""The Last Jedi"" i felt compelled to say something, to give a heads up to anyone who wants to go and watch it. Don't. Don't go. Don't give it any money. Wait for it, wait for it when it's free. I fell ashamed for paying for it, for feeding the beast.
Everything in this movie the Plot, the characters, the ""humor"" and the Porgs, all of it has a singular purpose -money. The entire film seems to be made of unconnected ideas that were approved by ""would you pay to see this"" polls after which they tried to connect it all by adding confusing and implausible scenes between them (including force Skype and improved force Skype at the end), because of this plot holes pop up every single time any of main characters try to do anything . I won't list them all, there is simply too many, instead i will only mention the most important one, the one that the entire story hinges on.

"An unpopular opinion, indeed. When I first looked upon this thread, I was honestly shocked by the amount of people who are bashing this movie, claiming it is the worst one of the franchise and that it ""killed Star Wars"". I believe the sole reason why many hate this installment is that it is different from what we've seen before. Star Wars fans are well-known for their incapability to accept new ideas, or to look past the original three movies. That is why so many enjoyed The Force Awakens, for it was a cheap copy of the original. The Last Jedi, on the other hand, features a whole new approach, which non-fanboy fans will find more than entertaining. The sheer amount of symbolism and recurrent elements in this movie make it much more that a regular Star Wars. The numerous plot twists were among my favorite things about this movie, including the ""much-hated"" reveal of Rey's identity. Fans are used to this childish mindset that things are supposed to happen a certain way. She uses the Force so powerfully, than she MUST be a Skywalker. She speaks in a British accent, therefore she MUST be a Kenobi (or Palpatine). What they do not realize is that...the Galaxy is huge. Trillions upon trillions of sentient, force-sensitive beings. I, personally, really enjoyed the fact that Rey was shown to be a ""nobody"", proving therefore that the Force is not tied up to bloodlines, but can be found anywhere in the universe, even in the most unexpected places. This is, actually, the whole point of this movie, along with symbolically suggesting to not keep looking back, but rather forward. The originals exist, were amazing and will always be there. But, it is time for us to move on, and add new, wonderful concepts and ideas never explored before to the Star Wars universe.",0.1512094155844156,0.5534247002997001
"Rian Johnson had every opportunity to make an excellent movie. Instead, he and Disney delivered a campy, goofy, and just bizarre train wreck that doesn't do any justice to the characters or overall saga. The pacing seems like it was determined by an 8 year old with ADHD, none of the major sequences had any real gravitas and instead are peppered with cheap slapstick humor, and worst of all, the film does no justice to the great characters that previous movies created. The whole thing just seemed like a cheap, farcical knockoff. There is no quality here. Utterly disappointed.
Furthermore, I'm utterly bewildered at how such an obvious pile of BS is garnering such rave reviews from critics, but lackluster reviews from the public. 
 Usually the reverse is true. I'm no conspiracy theorist, but is Disney paying off critics for good reviews? Something is fishy here...",0.11068840579710149,0.5449275362318842

"If i am honest, i hated The Force Awakens (granted i only seen it once, which tells you why i hated it), this film seemed a bit more interesting in terms of story however I can't help but think they are just simply recycling the luke/leia sibling story from the prequels with rey/kylo, even though nothing is concrete about her past/origin, i can't help but think that these films now just purposely lead people on with mystery for specific characters just keep the audience interested and hooked on this franchise, giving it the only relevance to remain a franchise. The whole ""who are rey's parents?"", i don't think anyone cares anymore if i am honest, all people want to see nowadays is some decent lightsaber duels (which this film was ridiculously short on by the way, might as-well have left them out).

"Before attending the midnight release for the film in the UK, I had so many questions and thoughts on my mind like; will Luke turn to the dark side? will Leia be killed off? will this be like an empire strikes back? and many more, and the biggest of all, will this movie live up to expectation. Unfortunately after the screening I was left with a sense of emptiness and mixed emotions. At first I gave this film a 5/10 as I had too many questions to ask like: Was the film too comical? Should they have killed off the supreme leader Snoke? Was it too convenient for Leia to use the force after certain death? Was Finn's part in all this really necessary? and did the cat and mouse chase of the first order and rebel fleet drag out far too long? ",0.11253246753246753,0.44294642857142863
"The Last Jedi was a film with so much potential, but in the end it fell short of the mark with poor character motivations and unnecessary scenes.

"As a lifelong fan of the franchise, it hurts to see how divided it's fans have become. I would like to start off by saying this is not a perfect movie, not even close. Upon my first viewing I loved it, but after repeated viewings the hype began to fade and I saw this movie for what it really is, a Star Trek episode. Not a bad Star Trek episode but not a great episode either. The inclusion of ""real-world"" problems like fuel is what hurt the prequel triology (politics and midiclorians) and this film. The movie boils down to a slow car chase that doesn't do much to move the story arc along but give us a buffer between Force Awakens and Episode 9. 
In an attempt to not solely hark on the negatives, this film did have decent acting from Domhnall Gleeson (Hux), Adam Driver (Kylo Ren), and John Boyega (Finn). Oscar Isaacs many others in the film do a fine job of portraying their characters. The development of Luke Skywalker in this film was a bit dissapointing. Skywalkers story felt like it kind of betrayed its source material but I don't know how else someone would react to the fall of the new generation of Jedi. Though seeing the return of Luke as a Jedi Master fighting against Kylo was a good payout. 
One thing above all was something that made this movie enjoyable, the visuals. This film is one of the prettiest Star Wars films I have ever seen. The cinematography and use of practical effects makes the hurt of poor writing lessen. 
My biggest complaint about this film is the writing, character development (lack there of), or the future of the franchise. My main complaint is that this film causes more questions and division than any film prior. I'm not wishing all of the questions made in Force Awakens be answered, but maybe at least one. For every one question answered in this film, ten more arose. 
This all being said, nothing the Disney/Lucas Films produces will ever live up the expections that most fans have for the franchise. Star Wars fans have these warped ideas of what they think the franchise should look like based on their fan fictions and the extended universe books, comics, etc. With the expection of the horrific holiday special and all of the Ewok TV movies, Star Wars fans must understand that some Star Wars is better than no Star Wars. With the boycott and remake plans being thrown around, movies that fans want like Boba Fett and Obi-Wan are being put on hold. We need to appreciate what we have rather than over analyze and complain about everything that is put out. The movies don't NEED to be made and if we continue this state of whining, they will cease to exist and we will no longer have anything to complain about because the fans killed the franchise.",0.09783755926613069,0.44256751185322607

"I've never ever yawned watching ANY previous Star Wars movies (not referring to episodes I, II, III which I still didn't happen to see) until now. The first half of the movie is just boring! For more than hour we are given to watch escape of evacuation ships. 
The jokes... What the hell Disney thinks? Do they really think that bringing the ""up to date"", trendy jokes taken from today's sc-fi Marvel flicks will do Star Wars better? Example - Rey was so desperate to find Luke because the Galaxy faces such serious threat from the 1st order yet she so freely and frivolously trifles about the force saying that she thinks it is about ""lifting rocks""? 'Cmon... 
What they've done to Luke is beyond any reason. He doesn't remind the Luke we used to know. And it is not because of acting or the fact he is ""older"" or became cuckoo because of the years of solitude. It is because he was entangled is a really badly executed relationship with Rey. They dialog between those two is one of the most awful in the movie. There is absolutely no chemistry between them. The moment Luke screams ""resist it Rey"" sounds totally blunt and artificial. 
Fin... what the hell is this pointless relationship with the midget girl about? What was that? A romance? An unexpected friendship? With who? And what's next? A wedding?
Leia - poor Carry... what have they done to you? Carry, if you hear this.. They made you blast into space like Yondu in the Guardians of The Galaxy except you managed to survive swimming back to the spaceship like a pro-swimmer. And it is all because of ""the force""..
Little puffin-like creatures... 'cmon Disney - is that really the peak of what you actually can come up with? 
The only character that still saves to script and movie is Poe Dameron who really brings a freshness into the whole story.

"The main sticking points I had with this movie:
1. Why Didn't the First Order Fleet Destroy the Resistance Ships Immediately? The First Order Fleet clearly outnumbered the Resistance and they had a number of Dreadnoughts/Destroyers at their disposal (also the fact that one X-Wing took down a whole dreadnought was ridiculous and was done only to showcase Poe)., so why couldn't they have caught up to the Resistance much quicker? Other than that, the action was cool and the tension was high but overall it was the longest chase scene I have ever watched in the cinema.
2. When Darth Sidious said ""To cheat death is the power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret."" I never realised that Leia would be the one to discover the secret by miraculously flying THROUGH THE VACUUM OF SPACE and back to the Raddus like Superman using the Force- this was the most ridiculous moment of the movie. 
3. Poe vs Holdo. This whole segment of the movie was a complete waste and didn't amount to anything significant. Why didn't Holdo Just Let Poe in on her plan from the beginning? I understand Leia and Holdo where maybe trying to teach Poe restraint but this was literally the Resistance on it's last legs and it didn't seem like the right time for moral lessons.
4. Phasma. What a joke. less than five minutes of screentime and Disney marketed her again as being central to the story (Phasma vs Finn, Book release, Last Jedi DLC in battlefront 2). GC is such an amazing actress however she was definitely short changed as were the fans.
5. Snoke. This was the most frustrating death purely from the fact that I feel like I wasted days reading the Aftermath Trilogy for them to suggest that he was this massive dark side presence and with RJ saying he was more powerful than Vader and Sidious yet he couldn't detect Kylo turning the lightsaber towards him?? And the fact that he's dead now means there is not much point for any further character development and he was another wasted character.
6. Rey's Parentage. While I can accept that she came from nothing significant, mirroring Anakin's lineage, why oh why did they build up on this theory since Force Awakens? In the end it meant nothing and for me it was just another example of lazy writing.
7. Finn and Rose. While their character interactions are excellent their whole plot in this story was completely insignificant (apart from Finn killing Phasma). They never recruited the Codebreaker they were meant too and they never shut down the tracker device. Also the whole sequence on Canto Bight was drawn out and felt like a promotion for highlighting rich society and animal cruelty (which are important) but how did this lend to the main plot?
8. Luke. Well where do I start? For the first hour and a half I thought his character direction and portrayal was great but then I began to realise why Mark Hamill initially said in interviews that he didn't like the script; he didn't give Rey any real training, we never got to see him physically wield a lightsaber and during his fight with Kylo he's now the worlds best limbo player??, also he was able to hologram himself? Across millions of miles of space?? and create hologram dice? This is where the nature of the Force is now just a Mcguffin which can fill in crappy plot holes. Luke's death was so stupid and ridiculous considering that in 40 years of canon and lore, Luke has always been promoted as one of the most powerful Jedi etc and his story continued well into old age. But after a hologram fight he just gets tired and gives up? What a joke. 
9. Killing off 5 main characters from the old and new trilogy. This just demonstrates how the writers have disregarded fans likability for certain characters - Ackbar, Holdo, Phasma, Snoke, Luke. All deserved more time on screen. And none of these deaths had any emotional impact compared to any other SW movie or certainly Han's death in FA.
10. Yoda appearing to Luke. While I loved Yoda's cameo, why didn't they introduce a CGI Obi Wan (they done a great job of Tarkin in Rogue One) as well since he was Luke's first mentor and arguably the one he was most attached too. 
11. the Hyperspace suicide... because of it the whole universe doesn't make sense... they could have used the same tactic against the Death Star.
Overall I would rate it 5/10 and by far the worst Star Wars movie. It had so much potential to be great (Luke fearing Kylo which could have led him to the Dark SIde and then lead him to fighting Rey and Kylo/ or Rey joining Kylo and ruling the Galaxy vs Luke in Ep.9./ Snoke being an Ancient Sith and killing one of the main characters or having Luke save Rey and Kylo on the Supremacy).

"This is the best Star Wars movie since Empire, if not since 1977. The haters are just wrong - they got turned off by opening 90 seconds of admittedly not very good jokes, which I think jolted them out of the heart-felt brilliance of the remaining 150 minutes. I spent the second half of the movie either in a mess of tears at seeing old friends reunite and rediscover their heroic resolve or mentally punching the air with cathartic joy as Rian Johnson bought together epic visual (and vehicle) design, heroic self-sacrifice, and the most successful evocation of that 'Star Wars' vibe since the 80s (spoilers>): ramming the Snoke ship at light speed, the heroic lone bomber fighter in the opening battle, the falcon intervening in the Crait battle, those speeders, all of Mark Hamill (but in particular his emotionally devastating and surprisingly athletic final lightsabre showdown with Kylo Ren - the power of this duel is quite subtle and will take a second watch to sink in), fleets of ships desperately warping through the galaxy under imperial onslaught.

"Did you want the sequel to The Force Awakens to actually explain plot points without creating more giant plot holes? So did I, but this was not to be. The film certainly has some pretty setpieces, but it's so fundamentally flawed that it beggars belief. To the critics who have near-universally praised this film I can only ask: did you see the same movie that I did?
The theme of The Last Jedi beats you over the head until it's sure you get the memo: let it all die. The First Order, the Rebels, the Jedi, it all needs to go - even new characters that we don't know anything about. If this isn't an allegory for the whole film, I don't know what is.
Did you want to know what the deal was with Snoke? Who he was, how he came into power, how he met Kylo Ren? Too bad, he's dead. He didn't even give us the courtesy of answering any of those questions. Did you want Carrie Fisher to have a proper send-off? Unfortunately she was the crux of the most bewildering and comedic moment of the film, and after that scene she was of no actual use to the plot whatsoever - even posing the question later on when our good guys turn to her for guidance of ""What are you looking at me for?"". I can only assume that Leia was kept alive for the sole purpose of seeing Luke's force projection later on in the film to attempt to give them resolution before he died of exhaustion, but it could have and indeed should have been done in a different way. Her arc was concluded in that moment before the Superman sequence that felt like it came out of a particularly awful dream. Yet Leia is still alive by the end of this movie. Holdo, who should have taken her place to carry on the fight was killed in a visually appealing but utterly stupid sequence that makes you wonder why lightspeed wasn't weaponized in every other film in the Star Wars universe when it could be used to such devastating effect. It certainly makes the sacrifice of Rose's sister feel completely and utterly pointless at the start of the film.
Speaking of the start of the film, the opening is so awful I almost can't believe it. Hux is now nothing more than a walking joke not even ten minutes in to the film because of an extended sequence between him and Poe which plays out like a prank call and ends with a ""your mother"" punchline. This isn't hyperbole. Poe then continues to be insufferable throughout the feature, pretty much directly leading to the death of the majority of the remaining Resistance. If he and Holdo could've talked like adults and established what the plan was, then there would have been no need for Finn and Rose to go gallivanting off to Space Monaco in order to bring back Benicio Del Toro. Del Toro's character is an interesting one, but he's introduced far too late. The problem here is that his character arc is so truncated and devoid of resolution that it's complete and utter sequel bait, and by this point you're aware you're watching a juggler with far too much going on to keep it all up in the air. The Monaco subplot tries to establish that the war is propped up by people who profit from it in some way, and it makes you think that it really wouldn't be so bad for Rey to join Kylo and just nuke it all from orbit. Especially the porgs.
The tone of this film is unbelievably erratic, swinging from slapstick to emotionally/hormonally charged to awful porg cameos that utterly outstay their welcome. I struggled to care about any of the growing number of dying Resistance fighters, and even Admiral Ackbar only got a passing nod as he went up in flames. Luke's character is written as if he's utterly lost his mind for 90% of the film, which compromises a lot of Hamill's performance. In those moments where he actually is written like the Luke we used to know and love, he's fantastic. As for others: Yoda's force-ghost is an utter madman who can now call down lightning from the afterlife, Finn is a massive coward despite his character growth in TFA, Chewie is absolutely relegated to porg joke territory, etcetera. Amongst all of this awful writing, Kylo stands out as the only one with a decent character arc. In fact, Adam Driver's performance goes some of the way to redeeming this film, and if he could have carried the movie solely on his broad shoulders then he probably would have. I'm sure this wasn't the writer's intention, but he's the only one in the movie that seems reasonable despite throwing a couple of temper tantrums. Daisy was a decent counterpoint to Adam, but there's even less justification for her absurd powers now that we know she was born to a couple of no-names, so if you were looking for some vindication that she was a Skywalker, you're going to walk away disappointed.
This isn't the full extent of my gripes with the film and I've certainly got issues with some of the lazy framing of scenes and general cinematography amongst other things, but I think I've covered enough to justify my 5/10.
TL;DR:
TLJ could have been a good movie with a different director and a screenwriter that knows how to create a cohesive narrative, but it's bogged down by stupid plotholes, stupid writing and too many characters. I'd give it a miss in the cinema, but if you're looking for a pretty popcorn movie that you don't want to think about, this might be an okay watch. It's not the worst film ever, but Rian Johnson and Disney seriously dropped the ball.

By no means this movie is perfect, and every movie has plot holes including the original saga, but that didn't stop people from rating other movies a 1. And especially the worst part about the majority of negative reviews is that most of them say how they walked out of the theater. How are you supposed to rate a movie if you don't even see the ending?!?!?!?!? The Force Awakens didn't do anything but repeat the original trilogy, and got heavily criticized for it, and now The Last Jedi does something unique and original, and you all are still is complaining!?!?!? These negative reviews are coming from people who went into the theater expecting a repeat of the Empire Strikes Back, and when they didn't see any similarities started to cry because it wasn't how they wanted Star Wars to go.

Don't have expectations of whats going to happen, Luke said it in to trailer, ""This is not going to got the way you think it is,"" and it didn't for a reason.

"I've heard some people say that Star Wars The Last Jedi is not about anything. I don't know what movie these people were watching, but what I saw was an emotionally substantial, evocative, intensely meaningful movie.
The overarching message of The Last Jedi is the notion that the needs of the many outweigh the WANTS of the few. Luke imparts this message to Rey when he reveals that the Force does not belong to the Jedi, but to everyone. Rey tries to convey this message to Kylo Ren as she strives to win him back to the light side. Leia and Holdo teach this lesson to Poe when they attempt to show him that rushing in and being the hero is far less important than protecting the light. And Rose beautifully expresses this sentiment to Finn after she saves his life and urges him to understand that the war against the First Order will be won by saving what they love, not killing what they hate.
The story is about the importance of collectivism, of embracing and protecting community and rejecting self-centered pride. It's interesting to note that the characters that express these major themes the most are female characters who are attempting to inspire and open the eyes of male characters. It is true that women tend to be more communal and it makes sense that the female characters would be the ones to spread this message of rejecting selfish dreams of glory and accepting the strength and power that comes from togetherness and unity. Such a great and unexpected theme to find in a movie series that is historically about some guy who is the chosen ONE who must save the galaxy.
In one excellent scene, Leia admonishes Poe for recklessly attacking the First Order dreadnought, an attack that costs many lives. Poe tries to defend himself, saying the people they lost were heroes. Leia responds with ""Dead heroes. No leaders"". Leia gets it. She has seen her share of hotshot heroes and she knows that it is better to raise up leaders who will bring the people together than to glorify heroes who will ultimately fade away.
This is why Rey is so important. She seems more interested in leading than gaining power or renown for herself. The revelation that Rey's parents were nobody of significance was so essential. It takes us back to the message of A New Hope, to the idea that even a nobody from nowhere can be special. Rey doesn't have to descend from some space-royalty bloodline to matter. Who cares who her parents are or who anybody's parents are. What is important is using one's power to lead with compassion. This is why Rey will be the greatest Jedi; she doesn't have to be a hero or a Princess, she can be a leader who shares the Force rather than keeping it for herself.
The Last Jedi is brilliant and it is certainly not about nothing. There are so many powerful messages in this story, timely messages. It is about the folly of vanity and hubris. It is about the importance of humility and forgiveness. It is about the idea that anybody can be a leader. It is about the danger of running away from feelings. It is about the destructiveness of greed. It is about the universal significance and power of hope. It is about the strength of women. It even takes a jab or two at organized religion and its tendency to anoint itself the arbiter of all good things. At its heart, it is about putting the needs of the whole galaxy ahead of the needs of the vain and the greedy and the conceited few.
Who will save the galaxy? Who will bring balance to it all? Probably not a lone man with a sword or gun out for glory. Instead, it will probably be a group of people who believe in balance, in equality, in protecting the greater good.",0.24642945851962247,0.5190831026896601

Those same people, a couple of days later, were reviewing the movie as ""the worse that happaned to their lives""... and I couldn't understand... why people is so far away from their real feelings, sensations, and experiences?... why is it so important to have a similar opinion with the rest of the intelectual sector?

Yes is there stuff they could have done differently. 1. That is definitely how Luke Skywalker should act.

"I am no movie critic, and I am far from being one. But I felt like the star wars fan in me had been stabbed by Rian Johnson. I am not going to say the movie was trash, but I personally liked The phantom menace more.
Luke, who at the end of ""Return of the Jedi"" was a strong and determined Jedi who was eager to be a Jedi and bring the order back, now is a hermit who doesn't even care if Leia is in danger. 
Snoke. what can I say about Snoke? A character with more than great potential, and with knowledge, understanding, and deep bond with the force equal to the emperor, was killed without a backstory, without a fight... truly disappointing.
Needless to say to those who watched it that there were scenes that were unnecessary, such as the quest for the code master or whomever. Why all the secrecy about that stupid character Holdo? tell the plan to all the  resistance and it would have given enough time to explain the past of Snoke or more on the battle of the salty planet, or more of the duel between Rey an Ben. On episode seven we were teased about the knights of Ren. Where are they? Where the hell are they?
On the bright side not everything was trash, visual effects, personally I'd give it an oscar; John Williams's composing was flawless (as usual); and Yoda played with the nostalgia in our hearts. C3P0 is still C3P0, Chewie is still chewie and Leia is still Leia (moment when she uses the force aside).
I started this review saying that I liked Episode one more, here why. Every previous Star Wars movie left something. On the original trilogy: nothing to comment, we all know the legacy they left. Episode III: Origin of Vader's betrayal of the Jedi, and the reason why Luke and Leia are appart, also the light saber duel on Mustafar was superb.

Episode I: At least left us The duel of the fates, and i am not talking about the song, I am talking about the Duel (It also left us with the second most loved Sith of all times Darth Maul ( not a personal opinion but a fact confirmed by a poll).

 The script was condensed so it seems, with more efficiency scene to scene and so the story moved along at a quicker pace. It almost felt like it was too fast, but not quite. Less technical mumbo jumbo in the dialogue too. Got a plan? Been a pilot? An insider or a mechanic? Get cracking everything will work out just fine.

The visual effects were hands down just amazing and the best in any Star Wars film that's so far been produced. However, the flow of the movie needed a lot of improvements. Comparing The Last Jedi to The Force Awakens by JJ Abrams, Abrams had such a great flow and it made sense of what he was doing and where he was taking the series. I remember being in the theater watching The Force Awakens and the last scene was when Rey was handing the Skywalker lightsaber to Luke. Then in the Last Jedi Ryan Johnson just had Luke toss it and walk away. That was ""the moment"" that we all were waiting for, really! Johnson didn't have a good balance of comedy either which definitely threw me off. How, would anybody think that Luke tossing the lightsaber would be funny and approachable. Disney should definitely step up there game big time in terms of having the movie be produced in a fan's perspective story line, rather than what the director thinks the flow and story line should be. The financials also prove that because the story line was being tampered with, the profit had been severely slashed on a Worldwide bases by $735,615,409. Now 735 Million is a ton of money to loose from one movie transition, so clearly something's changed or isn't working.",0.19858788554440726,0.3952805648457823

I think we got something somewhere in the middle.
I think the biggest problem with the movie was that they didn't take time to make sure every scene had meaning, which honestly shouldn't be surprising. Most movies don't do that, and Star Wars hasn't done that since Return of the Jedi really (although I suppose a case could be made for Rogue One). The 1st third of the movie really felt like a time filler. It gave Luke and Rey their needed scenes, but the other story arc about the Resistance seemed to be mostly a time filler. It was not well executed or thought out, and quite honestly bore very little impact on the rest of the movie. The same end could have been achieved by a much more effective mean.

Rey needs Luke to guide her, train her, but from these two parts she needs no training at all. She can wield a lightsaber like a jedi master just by concentrating a bit - Bourne Identity? Also, Snoke is only a joke. Ok they are making the same plot apprentice kills the master like with Darth Sidious and Darth Plagueis, but it was too easy.

Moreover, the director does not care about any of the historical characters and they are tossed away like meaningless trash. After just being aware of the force, Rey can dominate Praetorian Guards? What? Her fighting ability now unmatched without any training whatsoever? The movie makes fun of Jedi History and in essence and literally destroying all reference to Jedi anchient lore.

"I have read a plethora of ""fans"" reviews for this film prior to writing this. I am sure that the majority were children when the original trilogy was shown in cinemas back in the late 70's and early 80's. These films were originally conceived by George Lucas to be a modern / up to date answer to the Saturday morning adventure serials screened for children at cinemas in the 1930's. The point being they were made for children, his films a loving tribute made by him and updated for the next generation of children to enjoy. I am sure that all fans agree that what he achieved was a phenomenal success and there mere fact that films are still being produced today over 40 year later stands testament to this. Unfortunately I find, unlike George Lucas, these fans are unwilling to pass this experience (a child friendly movie) on to the next generation of children (their families) and choose to overanalyse and criticise every plot turn and character arc. I believe a conscientious effort has been made by Rian Johnson to placate fans whilst essentially keeping true to the films original intention which was light hearted, escapist adventure for children. Sure there is peril in the original trilogy which gives weight to the hero's undertaking but above all else it is a family oriented adventure story, suitable for children to watch unsupervised.",0.20277777777777775,0.49320987654320986

First it's a movie about the slowest chase scene in movie history. Really it's a 2.5hr chase scene. So we see bombers from the resistance blow up an imperial cruiser. Than they escape by going to hyperspace but wait the Order follows them. So there perplexed. Tracking through hyperspeed is impossible. But then they go oh wait this is how they did this tracking we are now experts on how they did it and how to stop it so they launch a side mission to get someone who can help them get on the cruiser and disable it. Even though tracking through hyperspace was actually impossible to figure out 5 minutes before that. So they succeed in the side mission make it back to the ship infiltrate the cruiser and get caught right before they shut the tracking off. So no reason for it to make it into the movie except to piss people off. Then Luke was going to kill Kylo Ren instead of believing that he could turn him from the dark side. Yeah I don't buy that especially since he turned Vader. Oh and both Kylo Ren and Luke are whiners. Just little babies. Oh yeah and dead Yoda shows up and has a ten minute conversation with Luke. I don't know who smoke was but he died easily. Then some guys in red masks with no force skills almost beat Kylo Ren and Rhey. Fast forward to the final act they could have had Kylo Ren kill his uncle Luke sealing him to the dark side but no Luke was a hologram or something. Then they go to the island where Luke was projecting himself from and he dies like Obi Wan. Dumb. Oh and the chrome stormtrooper's suit repels blaster shots. So don't know why all stormtroopers' uniforms aren't made from chrome? Or better yet the ships? Then you wouldn't even need shields. I would think this would be a huge tactical advantage. Oh and they destroy smokes ship by kamikazing it with a ship in lightspeed. But they are loosing support ships that ran out of fuel that just jumped out of light speed. They also make a note to say everyone evacuated to the bigger ship. So why not do that sooner and just kamikaze one of the support ships? Also when the hell has a ship had fuel? I was pretty sure that they didn't need fuel. Wtf. Nothing makes sense the force is dead with Luke. Now there is no one that is even rudimentally trained in the ways of the force left alive.

However, I have many point to review after I saw this film.I will separate are both of disappointment and impression. Let me talk about my disappointment to this film before impression.
 For my disappointment, firstly,after saw this film, I still not clearly know that who is ray's parents , there are many questions about ray's parents after The force awaken was released , and I expect that this film will give a good answer to me. Unfortunately, look like this issue is not important for this film, I believes that many people disappoint about this .
 Secondly, Supreme reader Snoke in The force awaken look seriously mysterious and so powerful character , It hard to believe that he quickly to die. In my opinion, writer should tell about the origin of Supreme reader Snoke more than this and audience should have opportunity to see his power of dark side and fighting more than this .
 Thirdly, the scene that encounter between Luke and Kyro len, before I saw this film, I considerably expect that I have to see dual-lightsaber seriously scene between both of them like The phantom mance (obi wan vs. darth maul scene). Unfortunately, disappoint again for this scene.
 Fourthly, the humour in this film is not funny enough to audience.I notice from interact of many people who watched the last jedi at the same time with me in theater , when some humour scene arrived, the audience have completely quiet.
 Fifth,I think Sound directors,they reduce bass sound of lightsaber, especially lightsaber sound while Rey have swing her lightsaber in training scene, that made me not impressive 
 For my impression in this film, firstly,I really appreciate that they bring Yoda, jedi master come back to this movie. It very surprising for me, Furthermore,I will very surprise more if they bring Obi-wan kennobi come back to joint with them.
 Secondly, I think the location where they chose for this film is amazing place also including amazing animals in this film such as crystal fox, porg and other, I like so much.
 Thirdly, Fighting scene both of Kylo ren and ley to encounter with the group of red guard knights.It is a novelty of fighting scene in Star Wars movie that I like also.

"Star Wars The Last Jedi was Awesome! It is definitely a movie that you need to watch again to catch things that you might have missed the first time around. It is definitely better the second time around, because it gives you answers to questions you might have left the theater with the first time around. I love how the story makes us question the force, and many things. It has us question the character of the characters. It has us question whether Luke Skywalker turned bad when he tried to kill Ben Solo, but then shows us that he only had a fleeting moment of weakness, which had consequences that he couldn't redeem. It made us question the character of Vice Admiral Holdo, Whether she was a bad admiral, or really good. The Last Jedi fits well with both the original Star Wars, and the 90s prequels. It ties the whole thing together.

"Star wars is now a cash cow. There isn't much too tell, not much to make up, specially nowadays where you cannot hurt anybody's feelings and risk a social media or media boycott, but it still sells, so lets make another movie. No, several. And some spin offs. As a result, the viewer gets more and more disappointment... Star Wars Episode VIII is an absolutely predictable film. Everything that happens, a non brainless viewer can anticipate it. The better thing to do is not use your brain at all, because you start to raise questions, the little pleasure in watching it is gone. For instance, how does a character survive adrift in outer space, with no suit, gets back to the half wrecked ship, a door opens and she gets in. Do not try this at home, or better, at an aeroplane, because if you do it everything will be sucked out and the structure will most likely implode. So the movie is a mimic to ""The empire strikes back"", more alien bar scenes, more gullible characters on the good side dwelling with issues, much more funny pets and robots Disney can sell as merchandise, CGI, CGI and more CGI and no creative spark at all. Very little plot. Very little novelty. Even Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher performances are (and I am very sorry to say this) feeble.

The action produced wasn't as intense at the beginning of the movie as compared with most of the OTHER Star Wars films, so it definitely felt slower moving than we're used to. However, some of thew most entertaining ideas that star wars has seen to date were employed. From floating in space without a suit to escape death, to literally teleportation across the galaxy using only the force.... The movie really inspired some age old ideas in new ways, and it turned out fairly well in my opinion. Anyways, I feel like it was a good watch, and I wasn't disappointed.

"Though I have watched all Star Wars movies multiple times, I do not consider myself a fan. I did not read any comics/books or additional information about the universe, I just simply enjoy watching the movies and be amazed by them. 
In my opinion TLJ is worth only 4 stars. 1 star is given because it is a Star Wars movie, 2 stars for the nostalgy factor in the movie and 1 star out of respect for Carrie Fisher. And that is it. 
The movie lacks of a plot. I remember watching the animated Clone Wars series back in the day and sometimes I felt more excitement in those 20 minutes then now in the 150 minutes. 
Though it is said in the movie to leave the past behind and forget everything etc. (which probably is an indication for the future movies) it would be nothing without the past - first they set Luke as a grumpy man who lost his faith, but then Yoda from the PAST guides him back to the path, new sweet looking creatures which we could see in the PAST etc). Not a single new tune in the score, not a single answer to the new questions, we don't really know more about our new heroes, they are just running around during the entire movie. Basically the best moments were the ones which has to do something with the PAST and without those moments the movie would worth 1 star. 
I particularly like that many fans were creating stories about Snoke and the parents of Rey, none of which gets answered since it is said in the movie that 'it doesn't matter and forget the past' and the huge amount of fans are simply OK with it and consider this one of the biggest twists in the movie. I consider it lack of creativity and letting people down. 
Hopefully for the next movie they will get themselves together and create a good story with some excitement and better twists and also some deeper characters, and please at least a new great tune.",0.1478040478040478,0.37453472453472453

The plot holes are everywhere, the character development is non-existent, and the director went out of his way to overtly dump on the Star Wars legacy for no conceivable story benefit. Comedy was used well in the original trilogy, but here it undermines the story and character development. Surely someone at Disney saw these failings in the script. They'd be glaring to any writer or even a first years film student. And WTF with the cut-and-paste 'critic' reviews?!? Constantly undermining character development with ill-considered jokes, and ruining the story with illogical plot twists, does not make a movie brave or creative, its just means that Rian Johnson script was rubbish.

"The Last Jedi non-spoiler review:After two years since episode seven:The Force Awakens, Star Wars is back! And I got to see it last night at the midnight launch.
Star Wars has always been an opportunity for escapism ever since 'A New Hope' and I really think that Rian Johnson got that in this darker than usual Star Wars episode.I had an absolute blast with this film yet again I was thoroughly entertained from the first to the last minute.I'll start with what I think is the.most important part of the film,the character's.For me this chapter was predominantly about Rey,Luke,Kylo,Finn,Poe and ofcourse Leia.This for me is the best acted Star Wars film to date in my opinion,with Daisy Ridley as Rey and Mark Hamill as Luke stealing the show doing some of the best work I've seen this year I really love their character's.Adam Driver as Kylo Ren also puts in a solid performance and Poe and Finn bring the energy and comedy that is and has always been a part of the Star Wars universe.The look of the film is breathtaking once again,the space battles were amazing and dealt with with a huge amount of care,the lightsaber battles and general choreography is some of the best I've ever seen in a Star Wars film,it was that good.John Williams' score as always was composed with meticulous care and if anything is an improvement on 'The force awakens'.Where I think the movie has it's flaws is within the writing of the plot, and the direction of which it takes.The movie advances at a rapid pace,however the Finn and Rose plot had no payoff whatsoever.I was disappointed in how they incorporated Finn into the story in general and the casino scene jist dragged for way too long.People are always talking about the plot holes of Star Wars films and seems to be a common theme again in the Last Jedi,I agree that there are certain things that need to be discovered,but at the same time remember this is what we asked for when we got the prequels,and look at the result of that...I'm just saying we need to wary that's all.Nevertheless this is pretty much every thing you could want from a Star Wars film.Does it surpass Episodes 4 and 5?No,but I left the cinema pleased and had a blast with it.",0.21776288227901133,0.4709991621281943

"Writing or directing a SW is a sacred trust. I can't tell if Rian didn't get that or didn't care. There are some novel and compelling aspects to this film, but unfortunately they are swamped by so many clichés and recycled scenarios, that there are times I found it hard to watch. The rag-tag rebels running from the big-bad empire thing is expected of course, and I could almost forgive another ""its a big gun let's take it out"" ploy, but after awhile the short cuts stack up, heaped on each other. No scene exemplifies this more than when the Jedi apprentice who is unready (Rae) and the Sith apprentice she is convinced she can turn (Kylo) come before the Snoke/Emperor figure and Snoke attempts to turn her by showing the rebel fleet getting destroyed. Did we have to keep watching to know the Snoke/Emperor would be killed by Kylo?

"'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' has very little to no flaws. Rian Johnson brings a perfect balance of humor, action, and emotion that is overshadowed by this film's darker tone. Johnson doesn't just make The Last Jedi a pure Star Wars movie, he makes it his own creating an epic sense that is beyond anything we have seen in Star Wars. From beginning to end, The Last Jedi takes what we love from each of the previous trilogies and surpasses them by creating an emotional story of family, friendship, and darkness that makes it the best Star Wars movie of all time by not only satisfying fans of the old generations' stories but by making this generation have their own.
 Personally, I think The Last Jedi is outstanding, even if it has minor flaws, cause it is about the characters and every scene and every plot device is to push forward these characters. If you don't like The Last Jedi, that is perfectly fine but for me I think this movie does have very minor issues here and there but an overall masterpiece and achievement in modern blockbuster filmmaking because it is a director's film that is not afraid to tell his own story just like Christopher Nolan and 'The Dark Knight'.

 The new characters introduced like DJ and Rose were pointless and did pretty much nothing to further the already doomed plot. Older characters like Snoke and Captain Phasma, formidable in TFA, were weak, dull, and again, wasted. And of course, because he is so hell-bent on changing everything JJ Abrams established in TFW, the director killed the one interesting villain in this movie off in one scene so ridiculous it was painful to watch. Isn't Snoke supposed to be more powerful than anyone before him? He couldn't see or sense the saber moving towards him? Come on. 
The only thing inciting some element of joy was Mark Hamill. Of course, Rian Johnson ruined his character too and killed him off after him doing next to nothing.

I mean it I swear it blinked and missed part of the movie. I honestly felt that after the resistance made it to the planet after escaping the star destroyers that the movie was suppose to be over. I also would like to point out some other issues which I will list below:
1. They sketched out every ""dramatic moment"" where a character is either about to die or is facing a problem (such as when Rey is talking to Kylo)
2. Rey's training wasn't much of training at all and in the darkside of the planet(the black hole) Rey did not confront her darkest fears, just a kongo line of Reys
3. Captain Phasma makes a return, only for about 5 minutes, so she was bait for people in the trailers (overhyped character)
4.A number of unanswered questions about Snoke, youtube theorist came up with many of theories such as who Snoke is, Disney didn't give any answers in the movie and killed him in his first real appearance which leads me to....
5. Snoke's death, I was kinda hoping for a fight and a more satifying death scene
6. Not a lot of action, the most of the good action (how little there was) took place at the beginning and end of the movie

"Personally, I really enjoyed this film a lot. Luke has lost his youthful optimism due to life experience and failure, and the central message of the film is to stop clinging to the past. This is intriguing. Moreover, the character development is strong. Luke finally overcomes his depression due to his past failure and manages a last act of dramatic heroics in a creative and powerful last stand. Poe Dameron starts to mature in his judgment of leadership tactics, preparing him for the greater responsibility he will take on in the future. People criticize the casino excursion, but it is through this experience that Finn develops commitment to a cause, rather than to be independent and sell himself to the highest bidder. Rey and Kylo Ren go through a fascinating development, pulled towards each other and yet apart. This culminates in an awesome fight scene, where they team up together against a common enemy, and then part ways. It's one of the best scenes, and Luke's final stand is a powerful ending. This has great characters, development and character arcs, incredible battles (space battles, lightsabers, and internal battles). It triggers emotions, and proposes a controversial philosophy for fans to discuss.",0.18198924731182795,0.5206989247311827

"I know that many fans are upset about the choices Luke's character made in Last Jedi. However, as someone who has classified himself as a failure for the majority of my life I can relate the to arc that Luke follows as he begins to doubt himself after his failure with Ben Solo. No! It is not the Jedi way to execute a ""Padawan"" (even in a moment of weakness). This is why Luke stops training young Jedi and goes into hiding. Searching himself for why he felt the need to destroy Ben Solo, Luke confronts his temptation to join the dark side once more. 
Luke admits it was a momentary lapse that led him to act against Ben Solo, and that moment of weakness shows the audience that even the greatest Jedi Master has more to learn. Luke hesitates to kill Ben as he realizes that darkness has guided his actions. Luke is then left for dead and awakens to see everything he has built destroyed by Kylo Ren. In his sorrow and anguish he recognizes his failure in training the next generation of Jedi as he surrounded by the bodies of his pupils and the burning remains of the Jedi temple he has built. 
Luke must realize that it was his own doing that has transformed Ben Solo into Kylo Ren. Yes, It was Kylo Ren who killed the Jedi trainees, but it was because Luke was about to kill Ben. Ultimately Luke is responsible for the deaths of his students. He has to see that as he pulls himself from the rubble. 
Luke's single moment of weakness defined the path that Kylo Ren was not aware was in front of him. Witnessing how ruthless his nephew was added to the torment inside Luke. If there was a line where Luke said ""I did this! It is all because of me!"" the audience might be more understanding of Luke's character arc.
Luke's story is how he deals with failure. How he takes full responsibility for not just turning Kylo Ren to the dark side, but for the actions of Kylo Ren who killed the other padawans and burned the temple to ashes. Tempted by the dark side to kill Ben Solo because he sensed Ben being drawn to the darkness, Luke realizes that even the strongest Jedi is not immune to the dark side and if he had killed Ben Solo then he, Luke Skywalker would have turned evil. It makes perfect sense then that Luke would disappear and go into hiding. In that moment of temptation Luke abandoned his Jedi beliefs and if he could be tempted after everything he went through in episodes IV, V and VI, then what hope does any young student of the force have against the dark side? If Luke recognized this (and I believe he did), then his decision to let go of everything in an effort to find inner peace makes sense. 
Luke acted appropriately to banish himself to the outer reaches of the universe and await death. In his solitude he seeks peace in the only place he can...the first Jedi Temple. Frustrated by his failure by being unable to help Ben Solo control his rage (and knowing how difficult it was for him to overcome the temptation of the dark side as he faced both Darth Vader and the Emperor), Luke Skywalker feared that he could not live up to the legend surrounding his past. 
The constant fear of training a Jedi who might turn and become the next evil dictator is something that may have been gnawing at Luke's conscience. Knowing that fear is the first step toward the dark side he decided to stop fighting and simply gave up both the good and evil. Luke found the true balance between Light and Dark by recognizing that both exist and counter each other. It is a fascinating study in human behavior to realize how Luke justifies his actions. 
I know that fans will argue Luke was out of character and on the surface I would agree, but as you peel back the layers of the human psyche to reveal the true meanings and motives behind Luke's actions you will begin to understand why Luke was where he was. Why he acted the way he did. And why he resisted training Rey. Even the lessons Luke does teach are inline with his philosophy of life as he now sees it. Luke lives with the pain of losing everything he built and being tempted or tested again. I believe Luke Skywalker made the only choice he could by sequestering himself from the universe to be the Last Jedi.",-0.028878621378621374,0.4487912087912087

"OK so I'm crazy.
Here is why.
Story seemed well laden for character direction and evolve. Even Star Wars evolves.
What was horrible was action. Where the hell was the vertical sway like on Ewok bikes? That's the feel that was missing and it sucks. It wasn't a damn lack of story feel and I'll get to that.
Where the hell was the dizzying, swirling vertical sway effects. I felt like a watched a damn good Star Wars story but I didn't watch a damn good Star Wars overall movie. Screenwriting outshone direction in this one. Carrie's portrayal was one of a sense of capturing herself in a timeless moment almost as if premonition of real life was driving her. Daisy's was pretty damn good too.Character portrayal was pretty great all around for all characters.
Forces better understood and more elaborate, maybe even more sci-fy tech might be coming: heck I don't know where evolutionary direction of this world is going. I could conjecture guess and have fun thinking about the next one usually right away but this one left me thinking the energy of the world of Star Wars was missing a bit. Future thinking seemed to be left uninspired and perhaps maybe that's another lost feel good or bad in the end. 
In the end of this one the story is very organic maybe too much so for those devoted hopes, assumptions, set standards but the organic action definitely wasn't .there. I think J.J. did better.

"Being an ardent Star Wars fan and having watched every single movie since the first one was released in 1977, I was looking forward to watching this one. It starts off in the normal way, which was good as it keeps with the normal Star Wars style.
Daisy Ridley, continues well to play the character that she did in ""Force Awakens,"" as do Joh Boyega as ""Finn"" and Adam Driver as ""ben Solo."" The late Carrie Fisher, who has been playing the role of ""Princess Leia.' ever since the first one was released all those years ago, along with Mark Hamil as ""Luke Sky Walker,"" are also good in their roles. But perhaps the writers could have introduced ""Rey"" and ""Luke Skywalker"" earlier then they did and this could have got the public a bit more interested in the plot. The action sequences were predictable at all times, while the sound effects were excellent and worthwhile listening out for. The cinematography is also good and for those interested in it, I would suggest viewing this movie. It was also good to see some of the old and original characters back - Chewbacca, R2D2 and C3PO. The only issue is that the movie drags on a bit.
Conclusion: If you are a Star Wars fan, then don't expect much out of this but it would be worth just to see it once. And for those wanting to pay a tribute to Carrie Fisher, then its definitely worth watching. What let's this episode of Star Wars down, is not just that its dragging at times and the length of the movie itself, but also it has two plots running along at the same time.

"The jokes are too frequent and aren't funny. Scenes that are intense and emotional are broken up by these unfunny jokes that ruin the mood of the scene. The first act/first third of the movie was boring and should have been condensed or changed entirely. The First Order's incapacity, inability and ineffectiveness is laughable. They can't stop 1 fighter from taking out their somehow easily blown-up laser cannons. 1 or 2 shots makes each turret explode? The Resistance can outrun them with severely depleted and minimal resources, and escape without them noticing or caring? This honestly makes no logical sense unless The First Order just wanted to play games with the Resistance. Rose Tico is an uninteresting and unnecessary character, and her side plot with Finn was dumb, uninteresting and useless. The subplot on Canto Bight was so short, and as stated before, dumb, uninteresting and useless, it should have been cut from the movie. I think the subplot had to do more with animal cruelty and orphans more than Star Wars; I'm not against important messages in movies, but make sure they're done well and fit the franchise, movie plot, characters, etc. Leia flying through space was the dumbest and one of the most laughable parts of this movie. It is so unrealistic and silly looking it is truly cringe worthy. The people on the ship don't act surprised, like she's done this before, and what she did is never explained or mentioned again. Admiral Ackbar's death is shown to be so small, insignificant and stupid, it is truly an insult to any Star Wars fan. A ""man"" who helped command and guide the Rebel fleet to defeat The Empire is killed by 2 random TIE fighters. They didn't have to kill him off for the story or overall plot, but they did. There's no problem with that, but give him the heroic death he really deserves, send him off in a respectable and proper way. Captain Phasma is one of the most underused and laughable characters ever.

"If I had to describe my reaction to this movie, I'd say I went though ups and downs while watching but ultimately left the theater satisfied. I'm going to simply give my opinion on three cons and three pros, based on what was actually in the movie. 
Cons:
-yes, the canto bight scene sucks. Decent enough concept but too long for too little plot and stupid cgi camels.
-The Holdo subplot was frustrating and felt like it was there only to manufacture artificial tension. 
-The Leia ""space Mary poppins"" scene was an example of good concept, poor execution. I was wowed to see her using the force but was held back by how visually goofy it looked. 
Pros:
-Rey and Kylo Ren's dynamic. I loved how it evolved from hatred to understanding to heartbreak. Definitely the most interesting new relationship in the series.
-Snoke's death and the throne room fight. I was so glad to see Snoke die, I thought he was a boring emperor repeat anyway. I was satisfied to see Kylo actually kill his master and take power like Vader once talked about, and the fight scene was pure awesome.
-LUKE SKYWALKER. I personally loved the direction they took the character. We see him beaten down and broken. But along the way we get glimpses of his old self as he encounters R2 and Yoda (two of the most emotional moments of the film). His actions on Crait in the end of the movie were incredibly heroic and inspiring. Overcoming his personal damage to sacrifice himself and buy time for hope to live on. That's what being a hero is all about. It felt like the culmination of all of his jedi training (""a jedi uses the force for defense, never attack""). Fading into the force like Obi Wan and Yoda before him. Amazing.
Overall 8/10. I recommend it.",0.11096724043152613,0.5722359650931078

"I swear 7 and 8 are now my most favourite films ever of the Star Wars saga. Because of the way they made the story as well as the visual affects. Which is awesome as well. But the downside to number eight is how Luke skywalker behaved which I heard over the news that almost 20,000 people sent a report to remove this movie from the Star Wars saga because of Luke skywalker's behaviour or not training Ray to become a Jedi. But I know for a fact that Disney also really good with visual affects and the visual effects in this film is stunning especially the way they've done Kylo Rens lightsaberIt feels very realistic but by far I reckon that rogue one out of all the new Star Wars film is Dave made is definitely rogue one and I'm really looking forward to seeing the new Han Solo film. I was really looking forward to Ray and Luke actually forming a partnership while training in the Jedi arts but apparently spoiler alert that doesn't happen so basically this film about Ray training to be a Jedi was a complete waste of time to go for where Luke skywalker was when he ran away plus also you find out the truth of why Luke skywalker run away as well which obviously they've got to include that in the film because then we wondering. we can't we can't figure it out by ourselves.

"I guess you can't that this is a love or hate it kind of film.
People cleary did not appreciate the fact that this was one of the greatest story in all of Star wars history because they where to attached to their absolute dog theorys.
Each and every one of those stupid theorys if they actually happened in the film they would have the dramatic weight of a feather they're not good.
If you don't see how this is much more relatable and a better dramatic reveal than just being somebody famous as daughter then you really do not appreciate good storytelling and if you guys where able to come up with said theories that's the definition of the word predictable, you just predicted it and that twist would have been exactly like Empire Strikes Back only noy good at all.
Instead we get this whole new theme that yes Rey is a nobody and anybody can't have the force now Luke says it himself and say that Rian trashed what JJ set up is so not true.
Go back and watch the Force Awakens and they coupd very well be setting up that she's a nobody, the film has plenty of that theme in it as well one thing JJ definitely did was leave a lot of stuff open ended but maybe too open ended because it led to way too much speculation. Now there is only one person that I know of that his prediction about Rey actually came true : ME.
I think the idea that Rey is a nobody and that anyone can learn the force is a great concept.

"This movie is not, by any means, a perfect film. However, I do think that there's something to be said about how ambitious, entertaining, and daring that this movie is. If you read some of the reviews on here, and other places on the internet, you'll see some common complaints such as ""Luke's character was ruined"" or ""entire plotlines were pointless!"" I address these two specifically because I believe that they were actually some of the best parts of the film. Luke's character was, quite frankly, improved. In the original trilogy, he was a hero in training who wasn't perfect and almost succumbed to the Dark Side. In this movie, he's a grizzled, old Jedi master who has his reasons for questioning whether to get involved or not. It makes him way more complex and also isn't something completely out of the character that was originally established. As far as the ""useless"" plotlines go, THAT'S THE ENTIRE THEME OF THE MOVIE! Failure is readily apparent in this movie and aside from the very end, characters both good and bad are constantly failing. Luke fails Kylo Ren during his training. Rose and Finn's mission ultimately fails. Poe fails Holdo by turning against her. Kylo Ren and Rey both fail to convert the other. Snoke fails to retrieve Luke's location from Rey. The entire Resistance pretty much fails to exist. Leia fails to get backup. It's everywhere in this movie and quite frankly, it's goddamn refreshing to not have the heroes succeed. I know I'm not addressing a lot of the complaints, but that would take ages (and plus a couple of them are actually good complaints.) The romance between Finn and Rose is REALLY bad. It didn't need to be there and it didn't really make sense. The movie also did drop a lot of things that were brought up in The Force Awakens, but the things that it did drop I feel like might make a return in IX so I'm not too upset. Production-wise, and I don't think anyone is arguing this, this movie looks amazing. Everything technical from the special effects to the cinematography, it's a beautiful movie. The acting and script were both also pretty good aside from a few jokes that don't quite land. Overall, this movie is damn good. It's hard for me to believe that anyone truly thinks that this is worse than the prequels. The prequels are quite garbage. You can like them, that's fine, but saying that they're better than this? Unbelievable. For my ranking, I personally would put it below The Empire Strikes Back and the original movie, but I would actually put it above Return of the Jedi.

"From the first instant, it seems that writer/director Rian Johnson is out to contradict not only the expectations and curiosities generated from The Force Awakens, but indeed undermine much of what we know of the Star Wars cinematic reality. Not that there's anything wrong with that approach. On the contrary, part of what made episodes 1-3 nearly unwatchable was a slavish devotion to old plot devices and gimmickery, a devotion so total that not a single new idea surfaced, and what made The Force Awakens so refreshing was its proficiency with those devices that revitalized them through elaboration. In this sense, that expectations are contradicted right and left in The Last Jedi ought itself be to its credit. But sadly, the baby is too often thrown out with the bathwater. We find an unrecognizably foul-tempered, off-puttingly irreverent Luke Skywalker, whose former boyish charm turned calm mastery had been so central to what made the original story arc of episodes 4-6 compelling. We find the rebellion mocking a clownish imperial army, the former sinister and ruthless intellect of which had posed such ominous threat to our heroes, captured sobelievably in Darth Vader and convincingly cultivated in Kylo Ren, now diminished by ineffective comic relief in the form of General Hux. The rejectionism of The Last Jedi has only a few interesting ideas to offer in trade, namely a doubling down on the feminism so totally and embarrassingly lacking in the original films, and the shrugging off of a nagging, implied sense of elitism whereby the Force had seemed accessible only to a select few of some mysteriously royal lineage.

The Last Jedi is a great movie IN IT'S OWN WAY. It shows the bond between Kylo Ren and Rey that we will explore in the FUTURE. Luke's character isn't bad. Yeah the film has some bad sides but what film doesn't have then. Some people liked it and I'm pround that I like it too. Look Obi-Wan went in to hiding after Anakin went to the dark side and NOBODY IS HATING ON HIM. The fact that Luke thinks the Jedi have to end is because he was afarid that another student would turn against him and that isn't a bad thing. We can't hold on to Luke FOREVER. STAR WARS IS A FILM ABOUT THE SKYWALKER FAMILY AND STILL IS. The fact that it doesn't follow Rey means it follows BEN SOLO(WHO IS SILL A SKYWALKER(MAYBE NOT IN THE NAME BUT IN THE BLOOD)).

Yes, there are flaws with the movie, I'm not saying this movie is a masterpiece. I liked this movie because it took itself in a new direction. I like the performances, the cinematography, the characters. There are a few issues with the writing, misplaced jokes, tonal issues and really big pacing issues, however, these issues aren't going to ruin it for me. If they ruin it for other people, that's fine, but don't go around exclaiming that you're right, and everyone else is wrong. And don't call out names and send them hate for working on this movie. Everyone sending death threats probably don't know how painstakingly hard it is to write, direct or act in a feature film.

"From reading the rest of the reviews here it seems the Star Wars fan base (Possibly a very vocal minority) have watched the film and looked to find all the faults they possibly can, attributing their own interpretation as Canon. I love Star Wars and I loved The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi to me felt quite distant from the fan service nature of TFA and Rogue One and while both were excellent films I feel Rian Johnson's take on this Chapter of the Saga was fresh and served a strong story and a great 2nd film. By no means is this film without fault, I felt the Dreadnaught 'Chase' and subplot on the Canto Bight were quite forced and took away from the pacing of the movie, if it were more involved with Rey's journey I would be happier but alas it only intersected in the end. I wish there was more to Snoke than what happened although I am now more invested in the journey Kylo is taking through this story. The redemption in this film for me was in fact Luke Skywalker and the interaction of the old and the new, it seems many fans are failing to understand that their interpretation was not the one Rian went with and his situation isn't what they wanted but I enjoyed all the moments he had on screen and was happy as a Star Wars fan to simply enjoy what was there. I could understand people not enjoying parts of this film but to rate it 1-3 stars is a joke. It had all the character of the previous films and took it in a different direction, people complained TFA was too similar and now TLJ is too different, with a franchise this big you cannot win but for me I cannot wait for the next instalment and the culmination of what both JJ and Johnson have created because while everyone is not happy with the way this turned out they need to take a step back and appreciate the decisions which have been made, trust in the filmmakers and just as we believed in George on the original trilogy believe in Johnson on this because we only understand the universe as far as the films and this is what we have to work off of.",0.18020590520590518,0.5633644133644133

"Firstly, I am a 40 year old male, born in the same year as New Hope was released and have been a huge fan of Star Wars since I was old enough to watch it. I am prepared to accept that my review may be biased given my love for the franchise but having had a couple of days to digest my opinion, I have come to the conclusion that my disappointment at this latest effort is not without real justification.
My feeling is that there was a distinct lack of respect in the writing. I don't simply mean in regards to respecting Star Wars lore although that is of course also true, but more to do with established rules of good storytelling.
From the start and throughout, humour was used at hugely inappropriate moments and although in and of themselves, the jokes were well executed, they detracted from nearly all of the more meaningful, darker moments of the film. This served to halt your emotional connection to the scenes and to the characters.
This highlights another flaw with the writing which is character development and consistency. Rey, we are supposed to believe has come from nothing, with no formal training other than being a scrap dealing street (desert) fighter, and yet is a deadly, highly skilled Jedi from the start. It may turn it to be false but revealing her to be no more than a skip rat, descended from skip rats doesn't do much to make her super powers believable. I mean, if you wanted to do the ""heroes can come from nothing"" thing, then fair enough, but there still has to be a developing arc otherwise all we have is a superhero and we have enough of those films to be getting on with if that's what we're after. These films are always about growth and development through adversity and hard work, discipline and devotion to a cause or spirituality; that being a hero means not having the most power or skill but of doing the right thing.
Similarly, our view of Kylo Ren is simply a test of our trust in what we're told rather than what we're shown. We never saw him with his parents and were never privy to his training or relationship with Luke so to expect us to invest in a sadness or hope for him just based on trust of the writer, is misguided. This is not to say Adam Driver's tearful anguished close ups were badly acted, but given the lack of back story to his or Rey's life, an audience can't be expected to feel how we're being asked to feel. Perhaps this is as much of the fault of J.J. In Force Awakens too for not covering any of it but it wasn't so crucial in that movie as the conflict hadn't grown.
I honestly felt more emotional bond between Rey and Finn when they finally caught up during the rescue in Force Awakens because we'd seen them already develop a relationship and mutual respect, they'd argued and bonded.
This sort of development is vital to how we respond to characters and then to how we respond to the scenarios in which you place these characters. To defy such laws of storytelling isn't brave, it's naive and foolish.
There are character flaws with Finn and Rose's relationship too which lead up to one of the most contradictory morality messages delivered by anyone in the film. Saving him from saving hundreds of his comrades and loved ones just so she could berate him and tell him he should be saving loved ones not fighting the enemy. Was this entire (completely pointless albeit cinematically magnificent) scene written by two different people? Their entire story together was weak and ill-planned and resulted in their efforts being seen to be not only futile but seriously damaging to the resistance. Yoda's message in the film that we grow through failure is one thing, but these two wouldn't be celebrated as heroes upon their return but as defectors and traitors. To simply imply that the few remaining resistance fighters that weren't eliminated as a direct result of these bumbling dimwits would simply say ""oops, better luck next time"" is again a flaw in the story.
And to return to Yoda - I can live with the summoning of lightening from beyond the grave if I must (and I also appreciate that there is a rumour that Rey has saved the books and taken them aboard the Millennium Falcon) but to have him as far as we and Luke are concerned, burning books as a means of delivering his message says more of our throwaway culture of downloadable content than anything else. ""Burn it all because it's what's inside that counts"" is a message loaded with a lack of respect for sentiment, for old ways and for at its core, books! which the next generation of Star Wars addicts to whom this film is directed, could well do without.
Perhaps this isn't bad story writing so much. But as the film is clearly loaded with pseudo political messages under the thinly veiled guise of the casino scene with rich people looking down on the poor and profiting from war, messages to our young is evidently on the minds of Hollywood and I know from my memory as a child that the stuff that Yoda says and does will remain longer in a child's mind than some long speech by a pair of numpties staring over a balcony at a horse donky thing. To deliver a subtle message that you can just obliterate history and that it doesn't matter is putting a lot of faith in our disenfranchised youths not to go on to repeat our mistakes.
There has been much written about the false promises and gotcha moments too so I'll do nothing other than agree with them all. It appears that the writer has no idea how to deliver a twist and instead offers a variety of ""pranks"". Again, poor and naive story writing.
There is much else but I feel it's more my opinion on how I feel characters would have behaved and as that is speculation in a fictional world, it's unfair for me to criticise.
I will however say to all those who believe that many people are moaning simply because it's not true to Star Wars and that they should embrace the new, that this shows a lack of respect to the franchise and to those who have invested in it. If you have so much courage of conviction in your story, write a different film using different characters. To just go blowing up and writing off all the old characters simply to hurry things along so you have carte blanche to do what you will with the new generation of characters is cheating. It's like buying a Ferrari and tearing the bodywork off and putting it onto a VW chassis and still calling it a Ferrari. You have to treat the whole thing with a certain amount of respect otherwise you end up with a different franchise which lacks the solidity which has meant that the Star Wars name has remained in the consciousness of people (not just its fans) for 40 years.
All this said, it is a visually stunning piece. Acting is solid and only suffers through bad story writing and poor direction.
The film will of course go on to make loads of money but I fear that money is being taken from the people who hope to wow their kids with their own memories of the Jedi ways and to pass on the message of hope and heroic deeds going rewarded. Whether this latest trilogy is going to be solid enough a story to have the future generation still talking about it to their kids is still to be seen. I personally have my doubts.",0.09105739939073262,0.5221194370003893

"Good: The Last Jedi finally adds something fresh and new to the Star Wars franchise. Its definitely the most intellectual of the series by further defining the concept of the force and exploring another side to these galactic wars with Finn and Rose's journey to Canto Bight. Despite these additions, the film is still bustling with energy. The action scenes, namely towards the end, are some of the best in the franchise.

"Walking into the crowded theater with others wearing festive costumes and t-shirts, I was rather excited. It had been two years since the last installment, and I was ready for a continuation of the Skywalker story line.
Unfortunately, I was disappointed as it seems that Star Wars: The Last Jedi fell into a childish trap that forced the movie to contain too many jokes. Yes, some of them were funny, but it was too much. The jokes than seeped all of the seriousness out of the situation and removed all of the suspense that this movie was supposed to contain. However, I would say the two and a half hour journey through the galaxy was entertaining, but it felt far far away from the expectations I had for the plot and for the writing. Usually, Star Wars is witty and exciting, but in The Last Jedi, the jokes are forced and the transitions are choppy. It seems that Rian Johnson just shoved the movie onto the shelves of Target and Walmart in order to sell a whole bunch of Porg plush toys. That said, the movie was aesthetically amazing, and the 3D experience was really cool. 
In the end, am I glad that eye saw it? Yes, its a Star Wars film, and I will see and hopefully enjoy every Star Wars film in the future. Would I see it again or buy it on Apple TV? No, not at all.",0.08919753086419753,0.5478395061728395

"Far from a perfect film but not as bad as the reviews make it.
Among other flaws, the Canto Bight sequence was indeed bad, Finn's character development was stalled and the ""long pursuit"" was a long dried up sequence that dragged too much and could have been solved if the characters just talked openly.
This movies has some interesting concepts though. The Luke Skywalker dealing with failure and reluctancy to come back to the front was a good take at a previously ""perfect"" character. It added depth to him.
The killing of Snoke was an interesting step that should have put Ren in a irredeemable path to the dark side.
The fact that Rey's parents were nobodies was refreshing and a cool way to open up the Force to somebody outside the same families (anyone can be powerful independently from the origin).
The take on war profiting was also interesting.
Too bad some plot points were dropped by the next movie which weakened the entire sequels. If only Disney wouldn't bend to the fans online and had continued with the path this movie started, we might ended up with a much more solid and satisfying sequel sequence.
Bottom line, flawed movie with some interesting concepts and some cool action. Not nearly as good as the original trilogy but better than the prequels (at least Ep.I and II).",0.10833333333333332,0.52375

"This is my first review on IMDB and let me start by saying I am a child of the 80s who grew up loving Star Wars. As a result, I loathe the toxic fanboy culture that has consumed this franchise. All they want to do is dump on Disney, the actors, the directors, the producers, the writers, and everyone associated with carrying this story forward into the future. They are like pathetic junkies looking for the ""perfect high"" that jacks their addiction to the next level while reminding them of their first rush. Then afterwards, in order to maintain their ""cred"" they compete to be the harshest critic to establish dominance in their very pathetic cabal of losers. As a professional creative, let me just say that the work that has gone into these new movies has been astonishing. Where most successful franchises only explore prequels or reboots (for the fan service and financial safety), very few attempt to write new chapters. I applaud Disney, JJ Abrams, Rian Johnson and this marvelous cast (newbies and vets alike) for trying to create something truly new and special.

The result is, that the funny one-liners are just too much, and very often with bad timing. The darker side of the movie is simply over-run by cute space-aliens. This movie does not feel like its made with love, respect and a deep understanding of the Star Wars legacy and universe, but rather as the best culturally- and political safe-mode movie a billion dollars could buy - and I frankly find that not just boring, but also sad.

And while it was a nice gimmick in an Indy Film (there was far worse in that movie... Shia LaMonkey... I was scratching my head in a 'what the hell is that moment') that Leia scene was the first of some of these moments in that movie. I wouldn't go so far and say that it is all down from there, but:
Luke is acting as if the events of the original trilogy never happend.
The 18 hour time frame of the movie doesn't make sense.
The whole casino planet setting reminded me very much of the prequels (as you assume: not in a good way... if I sit in a Star Wars movie for 20 min and wonder: is that really happening? that is too ridiculous to put on screen, there has got to be something wrong).
They continue to copy the original: the Hoth battle! The Idea with the red tracks is a nice visual, but the scene is not nearly as awesome as the original.
The cave scene, as well copied and so annoying! What's the point of flicking three times in a row?! (And yes, the scene is as bad as this ambiguous sentence)
A great actor like Benicio del Toro totally wasted with a flat character.
The rebellion about the leadership within the resistance is just filling time and is imitating drama.
When the movie is trying to be funny it more feels like watching Spaceballs. Star Wars feels like a parody itself.
Brining in an asian main character is OK, but like the multicultural cast of Rogue One it feels more like it happend for profit at the asian market than for the movie itself.
Yoda while unnecessarily put in the movie for fan service and that nostalgia Hollywood has to stop! at least I liked that rubber puppet feeling on his design.

The fact is, ""It just didn't feel like Star Wars"" felt more like a Marvel movie. Which I don't see as a good thing. They need to cut about 45 minutes from the film and stop ""Plot twisting"" to shock the audience. Sticking to the rules of the Star War lore would also help the situation.

Rose's character is a waste of time and is comepletely forgettable, Finn is wasted, which is unfortunate, because he was my favorite character in Force Awakens, The whole subplot with Poe and the Purple haired lady actually ends on a pretty cool note, Snoke is also wasted potential, and Rey and Kylo Ren are okay, but nothing all that interesting. The good moments certainly do make up for some of the bad, but ultimately, this movie burned me out on Star Wars.

"I usually do not write reviews on here, but after viewing this film almost a week ago, I feel I have to say at least this.
The trailer was so much better, I had my hopes up for one of the greatest movie going experiences of my life and well, that did not happen at all.
Rian Johnson probably didn't want anyone to see the trailer because they (Disney) made the movie look great and definitely unmissable.
Yes, I am an older fan, I saw EVERY Star Wars movie in the theater. I too, was not too thrilled with the prequels, but they were enjoyable in their own individual way, especially, to me, Sith. I did love The Force Awakens, It did just what it set out to do, Awakened the Force in ALL Star Wars fans. 
It was wonderful and sad to see Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia (General Organa) one last time and I loved her performance, it worked for what she was given to work with herself. Mark Hamil tried to warn us to not set us up for disappointment, but I think the fans were so worked up that there was going to be no way out of that.
It's nice knowing he was not at all happy with where the new team took Luke and so it makes it feel , like he said prior to its release ""that it's only a movie"" a little easier to take. Though, it was hard to watch the fate of the characters we grew up with and loved. C3PO had about 1 minute of screen time, I don't really recall R2D2 that much but for one scene, Chewie was hardly in it as well. It was a let down. I wish the trailer sucked and the movie was great, instead of the other way around. I am not at all excited about the next installment, it will be hard without Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford in it and oh yeah, Mark Hamil.....goodbye galaxy far far away. It was nice knowing you.

Its simple if you dont like it dont watch it. But we all or most paid to see this and expect at least a 7.0 or above for frick sake.

On this movie, I get the complaints and I get that the casting was over the top racist with 100% of the bad guys being moronic white dudes. It's totally ok to be offended by this as it is kinda a jerk move. I just rolled my eyes at this and enjoyed the movie. That being said, this is the first Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi that I did not know what was going to happen. It was a totally original script that really developed Poe and Rey and Finn. I still think they are making Kylo and the first order look totally weak and incompetent which is taking away from their impact on the film. These new star war flicks really need to step up and make a bad ass villain because the bad guys now are kinda dopey.",-0.08315508021390372,0.5007575757575757
"The Last Jedi is the first film that steps away from tradition. It's the first to dance to its own beat. The ""This is not going to go the way you think"" line from the trailers, is true for potentially everything that happens. Suddenly all the rumours you have heard or imagined equate to nothing. Aside from the fact that the difference between the new actors and the veterans is vast in terms of acting ability, the film's overall story, easter eggs, in particular the cinematography and soundtrack are now the gold standard for the series. Aside from one instance, the VFX from the series which started industrial light and magic are beautiful, with a great balance of practical and cgi working in perfect harmony. The film has some truly beautiful shots and one light sabre battle in particular was perhaps the best and the coolest there has ever been in Star Wars. Some wired story threads and a slightly dubious ending are not enough to ruin what is easily the best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes back. More importantly, the film does what the Force Awakens couldnt..... Star Wars is reborn.

"I love this film so much. It accomplished exactly what great art should. It is so brilliant that the film is about what so many who don't understand it don't like about it. One of the main themes is about attachment. Those who don't understand the film are attached to what they believe star wars is, was and is supposed to be, but everything in our world, including star wars, must change in order to make room for whats next. I've been a fan of the star wars universe since I was about nine years old. I grew up watching all of them, and I enjoy them all. I see them as an important American mythology, and am grateful that we're adding more amazing stories to the mythos. Those who go into the experience of this film with expectations and longing for an older story will not be pleased. That goes for any experience you go into with expectations. Metaphysically you are unable to accept whats in front of you because you want to see something else. This is an honest film about letting go of what no longer serves us. Things such as dogmas, nostalgia, toxic masculinity, selfishness, fear, dishonesty and past world views that stagnate what is being born in the present. Many thanks to all who put their heart and soul into this work of art. Looking forward to the future of this important and very human story!",0.26666666666666666,0.4796794871794872

I really enjoyed this movie. As a Star Wars movie it felt familiar but fresh und often did not give into the twists you expect. All the mayor characters are allowed to move forward and grow. All the deaths are well earned and the ending is well set up during the course of the movie. It has great details and a great re-watchability factor.

"I'm not sure what the direction of this movie was going for. Everything that was mysterious in the TFA, is either belittled and tossed away, or executed poorly. Also, for a continuation of the Skywalker saga it felt misplaced as it leaves you confused and out of words, which is never a good thing for a Star Wars movie. However, as a movie, by itself, it is enjoyable and fun, but as a Star Wars movie, it is severly lacking in terms of a compelling mythical story, which the franchise is often associated with. I can also understand those who think that the franshise has been radically ""disneyfied"".

"This is a movie for fans who understand the force and that most of Luke's actions were dark and that this was his saving grace to make up for all his attacks and killings in the past (ep6 on the barge), (attacking Vader 1st twice in two different movies, his hate and rage and dark side he used to disable Vader on the Death Star before his light side choice to sacrifice himself for his father and allow Anakin to actually defeat the Emperor as it was always said that he would and defeat the Dark Side. 
 I have never been a fan of Luke because when things got tough he left, after the battle of Hoth he ran away, during the battle of the DS shield on Endor he ran away to confront his father abandoning his friends to whatever fate awaited them so in direct disagreement with Mark Hamill I think this Luke did exactly what he would do when some as strong rose to oppose him and he couldn't deal with it. Run away and hide away and wait for someone to deal with it. 
 To be honest I wasn't expecting him to show up at the end to confront Kylo, I was expecting Wedge or Hoping maybe even Thrawn or someone else to come in and save the rebellion but it was Luke in a twist of fate and that wow he finally got up the courage to over come his fear of what he had created and took responsibility for his error in trying to murder a child. 
 For the rest of the movie, there hints of Zahn masterful writing of Thrawn's thought process in both Leia and her next in command and if you have questions about the force there are so many references to Karpyshyn's writing of Bane and the basis for the force were scattered throughout and if you have read them then they explained the force so elegantly and beautifully. 
 It is a movie about characters trying to find out who they are, where do they fit while being a relay with the older characters handing off the baton to the next group with the Death of Ackbar and the Rise of Poe and the lessons in subtly and bravery and surviving that he needs to learn in order to take the place as leader of the rebellion (my hope at least) and become the next General. Finn finding out that he is so much more than he thinks he is and his struggle to find out that he is brave, he can stand up to those stronger than him because he needs those around him and they make him strong. 
 The baton has been passed, Leia (we will miss her) doesn't need to make an appearance in the next segment as she isn't needed anymore, the old stories have fallen into legend and new legends, new heroes have risen for a galaxy under the reign of the First Order both Evil and Good and it was exciting. 
 The fight scenes were wonderful, it seems like they had a person who had actually been in a bar fight or dare I say it to war and fought to survive and know that an honest person to person battle lasts a minute maybe less and then you either move or something else intervenes. For a moment if you read the books you see hints of the Jason and Jaina that we all love in the duet battle on Snoke's chamber that makes anyone who read books to feel that twelve year old child giddy from their fights throughout the galaxy back to back against evil and then they spin it rather wonderfully in a way that you know things are going to change. 
 I actually can't give this movie credit enough especially since I went in reading reviews of how terrible it was and a let down but I came out cheering and thanking Disney that finally got a SW right and made a beautiful movie in the background and forefront and opened up the possibility of really good dare I say epic books to follow.",0.14913656471033515,0.5461807773283184

"TLJ has some unexpected narrative twists and changes in character that will unnerve many.

It is worth remembering that Luke always seemed capable of dark acts (for example when cutting off his father's hand) however we as an audience know that this is always with one purpose, to preserve the light. The same can be said of the brief moment in TLJ when Luke ignites his lightsaber on his nephew, Kylo Ren. 
The film is visually breathtaking. The planet 'Crait' could be one of the best ever created, and in general the special effects are the most impressive yet (see Holdo's sacrifice as a particularly spectacular scene).
Although the film sometimes struggles to balance its tone in the same way as Empire Strikes Back, for example, its missteps are often its strengths. I advise the fans to accept TLJ's flaws, and instead admire its bravery.",0.2854636591478697,0.5098997493734336

"Well suddenly I see it clearly movies are not there to entertain now and give to the viewer. They are hear to take. Disney not only pumping up the price compared to everyone else. They have taken Star Wars and turned it into a money churner and not the story we all loved. I see so many 1 or 10 reviews for me its not a 1 nor a 10 so I give it 5. Why well I saw so much bad reviews I thought I would not enjoy and actually I did for the most part. Seeing the first one in 77 in a cinema I feel part of the fabric of Star Wars followers. But now what I loved is gone to setup for 4 more movies. Sure this was going to happen but it felt cheap. (Spoilers from now on) Problems:
1. What is the point of Skywalker vanishing? Now nothing is left for me to watch anymore. 
2. Give me a break with these porgs Jar Jar again pfft such a silly thing I mean nesting in the falcon OMG.
3. Cantobite sub plot needed yes but really there was no need to Tran.
Overall I was with this movie maybe a 8 till the ending. Probably worse than Seinfeld and that is saying something. Thanks for a great movie well mostly.

"Contrary to several reviews by others on The Last Jedi, I enjoyed this movie. I first left the theatre thinking I did not really like it. i thought that it was repetitive and that I had seen most of it before. I was annoyed about how the franchise continues to hold on to old characters or objects from different trilogies like Leia, the Falcon, C3P0 or R2D2.
 However, I could not get the movie out of my mind. I kept thinking about it days after I first saw it. So I went and saw it again. After viewing it a second time, I realized how out of place my original opinion was. I enjoyed almost every aspect of this movie. 
 I think that the movie is crafted well and that the acting, particularly by both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver make this movie. Their performances are truly moving. Daisy is much more confident on-screen in The Last Jedi and it shows through her character as ""Rey"" has established herself as a force to be reckoned with. Daisy's performance is wonderful and I look forward to seeing how her character develops in Episode IX. On the other hand Adam Driver's performance, to me, is something else. Like Daisy Ridley, you can tell that he too is much more confident in his role as Kylo Ren. But beyond that, his delivery of lines is exactly how they should be delivered in my mind. For example, when on the planet Crait, when he tells the TIE fighters to ""Blow that peace of junk out of the sky!"" is truly a perfect delivery of such a line. Likewise when he demands ""More, More!"" when the First Order is firing on Luke Skywalker is again a moment in which he shines. It is a perfect delivery that fits perfectly with the development that has occurred throughout the movie in terms of his character. I think that not only Driver's delivery of lines and more confident on-screen performance are very good, but his performance is also stellar in terms of emotion. His ability to go from being the evil villain Kylo Ren to being the young Ben Solo, is remarkable in my opinion. He is able to emotionally effect the development of Rey as we know it. He is able, while under manipulation from Snoke, to make Rey feel his pain and feel his internal conflict. Adam Driver is able to portray a character that is conflicted internally and he does so very well. Whether it be through the anger in Kylo Ren or the sadness in Ben Solo. His use of emotional tones is very good. 
 Overall, I think that The Last Jedi is a good movie that has not received enough credit. Some performances are better than others but to me there are none that ruin the movie or make it bad. I think it's actually quite good.
If anyone is unsure about the movie or feeling like they did not like it, I recommend seeing it a second time before you make your mind up. I've seen it more than twice and I like it a lot. I would recommend seeing it again if you are on the fence about it, it may change your mind.",0.2512361111111111,0.4743333333333334
"A lot of positives here. The acting was solid and Adam Driver was excellent, despite the hammy script and it had a number of fantastic set pieces and spectacular space battles. After the predictability of The Force Awakens, it was a pleasant surprise to have some actual plot twists. Its not perfect and dragged a little in the middle (which could have been fixed by replacing the whole codebreaker section with a 2 minute montage) and despite the long running length, there was a number of unanswered questions. Ignore the haters, whilst some editing and a script rewrite would have improved the movie, only a fool would score it less than four stars.",0.1268229166666667,0.4833333333333334
"I went to see it last night and all I'm seeing is so many people panning the film like it was the worst piece of work ever done under the Star Wars saga banner.
There is no intention of spoiling the film for any potential viewers but all I can say is that you need to remind yourself why you wanted to see it in the first place. 
Now it's hard for me to objective about it because I was 7 years old when I went to see the original and have been an avid fan for the past 40 years but the whole purpose of a review IS to be subjective as it's solely your opinion on the film, nobody else should influence you into making a decision about what you expect from a movie. All I can say is that it met almost all the expectations I had and nothing will change that.
When I fell in love with the Star Wars universe I was a child, it gave me an opportunity to escape from being a schoolboy on planet Earth and drift off into a place that triggered marvellous things in my imagination, made me want to want to be a part of it and experience it, I absorbed it and let it invoke emotions in me through the entire spectrum that it could possibly have done. I was never interested in how great the script was, or the political messages behind the film or how hammy an actor was. 
So 40 years go by and I don't expect anything else from a Star Wars movie other than going through a gamut of emotion and being awestruck by the special effects and John Williams' mastery in film score writing.
It appears that people expect something that NONE of the other films were and will never be happy unless it becomes a serious story in it's own right. It was always meant to be a story for children ( the highest classification any of the movies ever had was PG-13) and to bring back the inner child for a few hours for the adults that go and watch it.
So be a child again, bring your children if you have any and just turn the clock back, sit back and let it remind you of why you are sitting there in the first place",0.08235930735930735,0.4981962481962482

"The Movie: Johnson took the force into hyperdrive! He illustrates what Obi-Wan, Yoda, Windu, and Qui-Gon were teaching. It was amazing! I'm glad Johnson has enough understanding to depict it meaningfully, yet simply enough that most of an audience can grasp it. Hamill and Driver's performances stole the show too. Ridley was great, too! Loved how Johnson spent some extra time with the camera on the Princess, since we know that she's never coming back. I'm glad that the movies so far have given each OT character their due, and Johnson spends extra time on Fisher. Much of the different plots mirror Star Wars plots in the past, but Johnson goes into completely different directions, and it worked. Some humor, but it's a heavy movie. The middle portion of the movie with Finn is a good time to do a restroom break. I didn't like everything; however, everything was plausible and fun.",0.23229166666666665,0.4822916666666665
"I really wanted to like this film, it had great moments with amazing special effects BUT with that said there is serious issues with the storyline. Let's start with Yoda, I love Yoda but why is he ""old"" and barely moving around when Anakin was made young again at the end of Ep6. Also he's solid not a ghost. Why was Admiral Akbar killed off with no fanfare and who the hell is the second in command with Leia? Why should I care about here???
Speaking of caring, what's up with Finn & Rose and their pointless adventure that was painstakingly slow. Not a fan of Rose's acting ability just not good...
I'll end with Luke's ending (but I could go on). For a powerful Jedi, they never let him go full Jedi. I mean when he faced off against Emo, sorry I mean Kylo, I was so ready for him to raise arms and knock down AT-AT's like dominos, I have played games with Jedi's who brought down Star Destroyers.

The only positive from this movie is gained from the visuals like the space battles but other than that the movie is just damned awful. Johnson completely got the character of Luke wrong which has left me getting angrier and angrier thinking about it as the days go by. My lasting memory of this movie unfortunately is that Leia space scene....What were Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy thinking? Kennedy seems more interested these days on diversity and which strong empowered women can we put here or there instead of actually making a good film.

"In brief, The Last Jedi beautiful, well done from an artistic and technical standpoints, and a colossal misfire on pretty much everything else.
Following all the intrigue and questions posted by The Force Awakens, the Last Jedi was expected to give some answers or follow up with questions like, ""who is Snoke"" or ""Who are Rey's Parents"" and ""What happened to Luke."" These questions are either not answered or given such weak throwaway answers that they simply disappoint. 
Luke's return is also one of the most disappointing things in a Star Wars film. His triumphant moment of return is simply embarrassing, and a cop-out on the film's part from taking a risk or making the character do anything exciting or meaningful. 
Still, from a technical standpoint, the film is well done. The battle on the salt planet, in particular, stands out for being visually arresting and simply beautiful, and the new planets look vibrant and alive, with charming new creatures to boot. But a lousy plot, poor pacing, feeble solutions to intriguing questions from previous films, and a lack of simple Star Wars moments make this film tank.

"It was just a bad movie and the fact it was a bad movie had nothing to do with how they treated the mythology of Star Wars or Luke Skywlaker. Honestly, that was the least of the movie's problems.
Many plot holes, poor dialogue and surprisingly poor acting from some great actors, boring story of little consequence, boring characters with zero chemistry (makes you appreciate Padme and Anakin's relationship). Kylo and Rey gave us a little glimmer of hope but eventually both journeyed to the boring side. Even the sets made the movie feel claustrophobic unlike say Rogue One which made tremendous use of its locations...
I appreciate the inclusive and socially relevant message this movie was imbued with. But even that is not sufficient to transform this clunky movie, or any clunky movie, into something good. Case in point: I like Rey a lot and I like girl power. But even Rey got lost somewhere in this movie which lacked a center and a purpose.
Overall, this whole movie was very emotionally sterile. It really was; sure it had twist and turns, but there was no passion or ferocity or swashbuckling bravado... the movie created a sense of righteousness and it is a great sensation for the audience is it were not the only emotion viewers were left with.",-0.06755952380952382,0.604186507936508

"Remember when I first saw Starwars - A New Hope in around 1997. I actually found that Starwars wasn't (just) a SCI FI movie. (According to some description) It's a drama talking about human behaviour, psychology and maybe some elements you can think of. But I would love to watch every detail they made on the screen. The world that George created. 
But when it came to EP7, it turned to a 'Avengers' like style movie. Eventually its maybe better in competitions to other movies. But it seems not a long lasting Starwars.
So I'm quite happy to see EP8 back to this track. There will be people who like it, and there will be not. The visual effects is still stunning.
The only thing is it might have added some 'Disney' element like Porg stick onto the window of Falcon (never mind, just another JarJar). And the kid at the ending... (a new story?)...well.

It is total obvious when you check how they want to make SW movies every year and they hire and use incompetent people to make SW movies. Also I can't understand how they didn't write the whole story for the new trilogy before directing. Instead of it they gave too big freedom to the directors over the story. The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi feel totally different movies. In The Last Jedi there is no story at all only side stories to use the side characters not to forget them but nothing more only lowbrow jokes.
Only Kylo's character has development and better written story others are just there to do something but usually the movie explains nothing for the viewers so it just gets boring also Rey has no character development she just knows many things without teaching. Finn, Poe and others have no real impact on the events you can really feel the movie makers just created them as the helpers of the new SW hero Rey but now they have no idea how to use them well in the movie... also the directors wanted to make different things in their parts for example Abrams wanted flying rocks around Luke in the last scene but Johnson wanted Luke without the Force... very bad teamwork at Disney's SW and we can feel it in the new movie how they forced some elements of the story for a direction they want to make later.
Also they hired the old actors to lure more fans to the cinema but they have no impact on the story they barely do anything also they changed the character of Luke then they killed him to close every connection to the old movies to make it pure Disney Star Wars they always wanted but the problem they have no good writers and they don't want to use the good fanfictions what are better then this crap movie.

>The acting is good-great throughout
>Quite a few surprises, nothing quite goes the way you expect it to.
>Funny in places (although it goes a little too far at times)
>More original than TFA (still a lot of call backs though)
>Over all the story is good and well written, if a little loose.
>The action/fight scenes are very entertaining and well done/shot.
>Lots of Lump in your throat moments (some a little forced)
>A Fitting emotional farewell to one (maybe two) beloved characters.
CON
>It's over long, this movie could have been easily trimmed down or tightened up to 2 hours.
> Too many story lines the movie should have focused on the Rebel fleet, Rey/Luke and Kylo-ren.
>Finn's story-line felt like ""got to give him something to do"" it would have been much better if he had stayed with the Rebels and helped Poe defend the ship or something (maybe a Phasma lead boarding party to defend against).

If you remove the Star Wars banner there is actualy a very decent movie to be found in The Last Jedi. That being said this movie has more in common with a Luc Besson movie than with Star Wars. Actually Valerian reminded me more of Star Wars than this. So how is The Last Jedi? Pretty ok actually. I just didn't like the jokes. They were to slapstick for my taste. The story itself was ok minus the storyline of Finn and Rose. Personally I was hoping for a new Skywalker but it was not to be. Luke is there but doesnt remind me much of the Luke I used to know but was ok. The acting was pretty ok all around. Special effects and visuals were also good but on par with the prequels. For me it was like Rian Johnson tried to hard to seperate himself from the saga. In trying to make something special he made something avarage.

"I understand why hardcore fans didn't enjoy this movie. I'm myself a pretty huge fan of the series, and I didn't mind it as much. It seems like the people complaining about all the new stuff, is the same that complained about how The Force Awakens was too familiar to episode 4. The movie has it's issues, some weird scenes that didn't make that much sense, and some bad phasing with Finn's storyline. The movie is different from other Star Wars films, since the main story feels like one big scene, while the other storylines where there to fill out some gaps. Unlike episode 4 which feels like it had taken place over several weeks, if not months, this movie feels like it takes place in a couple of days. There where some great moments, the cinematography was excellent (I was scared there would be too much ""symbolism"" that would take over from the story from some of the trailers (I through the red smoke on the winter landscape was too visual, but it made sense in the movie), which wasn't a problem at all), and most of the characters where amazing. It doesn't feel as much as a Star Wars movie as some of the others, but it's certainly not the worst one ever, as people are saying, but it doesn't beat the originals, which is good. While the other people are saying that the entire saga now sucks, because of this one elemental that was added, is simply wrong. The Star Wars saga is still amazing, and even though this wasn't the episode everyone had hoped for, or was hyped about, it's till a good movie. The reason people dislike it so much, is because they're comparing it with the original trilogy, which is simply wrong to do.",0.10056452556452558,0.5081344331344331

"I went to see The Force Awakens in Hong Kong with my brother. It was going to be the climax of an action-packed holiday. My brother had already seen and enjoyed it back in England, and was eager for me to relive the magic of my youth. I had been primed and was in the mood. We had been to Hong Kong Disneyland and seen unbelievably huge amounts of SW merchandise. Even jewellery stores in Causeway Bay had pricey silver Millenium Falcons for the best part of a hundred pounds -I was tempted but I would wait until the last day, just in case I needed the money later. It was Star Wars mania all over again! And I was 'up for it'! So, off to the cinema we went. The opening credits came up.... Yes, THIS IS STAR WARS! The bombastic Williams' score.... THIS IS STARWARS! And then the rest of the film fell flat on its face! I would've left the cinema were it not for my brother. IT WAS NOT STAR WARS. It had none of the heart of the originals. It's like if Ed Sheeran makes an entire album of Sabbath covers, is it a Sabbath album? No... it's a bloody Sheeran album. I watched The Foreigner with Jackie Chan in mainland China the other day. I was assured it had subtitles since my Chinese is atrocious. It didn't. I would rather sit through that again and barely understand a word than rewatch The Force Awakens. I assumed the sequal couldn't possibly be worse...
The Last Jedi is the equivalent of Stock, Aitkin and Waterman for cinema. It's sole purpose is to generate dollars. It's a money making machine.

"I literally do not know where to begin with this movie. It does not even feel as if I am watching Star Wars. There is a complete disregard for its predecessors and nonsense thrown in along the way to keep a nice balance of terrible and awful. We begin by watching what are basically WWII bombers take on some massive ship only to be obliterated, but not before an unsung hero who uses her power of kicking and calmly breathing in space (the doors to drop the bombs are open the entire time) to manually make the drop. I mean seriously? This opening scene alone was enough to make me question who let this script be finalized. We are eventually brought to the main plot which turns out to be the most ridiculous idea ever. The entire reason that this movie happens is because the Resistance ship stays just a little bit ahead of the First Order ship and out of their range. I mean really?? You are gonna have me believe that the First Order can't just move a bit faster? For over 18 hours we are supposed to believe that the Resistance ship stays safe..... because they are just a little too far ahead. Wow. My favorite part has to be when Leia breaks the laws of physics and suddenly uses the Force..... to not only breathe in space... but fly like Superman. That is only in the first 45 minutes. The character of Rose is undeniably my least favorite part about this movie. Rian Johnson can try all he wants to try and make me care about her, but I won't. Honestly I was rooting for her death. This woman goes from watching the escape pods at the beginning to I guess having some serious position at the end?? After she of course goes on the worst mission ever with the other worst character in this new trilogy. They somehow leave undected from the main ship (which is still staying JUST a bit ahead so they do not get killed) and travel to another planet that I do not care about. Here Johnson tries to get you to sympathize with Rose for literally no reason and introduces you to Del Toro's character who ends up stabbing the Resistance in the back anyway. The pairing of the two most unlikeable characters in the movie was hard to watch the entire time and it never got better. This movies script was its downfall from start to finish. The hot steaming pile of trash that was the finish however really put the nail in the coffin. After the Resistance is given a second chance when their ship crashes through the First Order's, somehow Finn and Rose are the only two people on their part of the ship who did not die and peopmtly have a showdown with Captain Phasma... that lasts about five minutes when BB-8, a droid remember, operates an AT-ST and takes out the remaining troopers that came with Phasma. Phasma then dies, because apparently that character really did not matter at all. Meanwhile Snoke, who is supposed to be the most powerful Dark Lord, is betrayed by Kylo in a way that had me more puzzled than ever. If you somehow are able to know all about the force and know how to look inside of Kylo to see where his allegiance lies how do you miss his change?? You expect me to believe that Kylo is stronger than Snoke??? Seriously? The guy could not beat Rey who had never even used a lightsaber or the force. At least make it believable. Snoke was never even given any background; we do not even know who he really is or was now I guess. Another waste of a character. Now we get to this last Resistance hideout (which is just amazingly equipped with guns and ships and trenches already dug out by the way) for the final fight. Rey shows up in the Falcon... somehow even though she left on Snoke's private ship. I did not agree with Finn's reasoning to sacrifice himself but I thought it would be fitting... until Rose screwed it all up... for no reason... basically dooming everyone in the base. And guess what she did it for? Yep you guessed it... good ol' love because that's what the movie was missing, a love story between its two most god awful characters. Now here comes the best part. Honestly getting to see Hamill on screen was the best part of this entire film, I thought he did well with what he was given and really stuck out. What the film chose to do with him on the other hand is probably the most nonsensical, unbelievable, ridiculous thing that I could have seen. They expect you to believe that Luke is able to project himself over billions of miles in a holographic form. Even for the most powerful Jedi in the world that is not even logical. Then after all of it ends... he just dissipates. This movie kills off probably one of the best characters in all of cinema history by him just ""being at peace"" and leaving. It was insulting to see. By the way, Yoda being able to use the force and physically touch Luke was laughable. Never has that ever been allowed or even talked about and I will be the first to say it's wrong. This movie crapped on everything that came before it and I really do not think the franchise can come back after this mess. I think the entire saga is kind of ruined after this.

"Ok, so I went to ""The Last Jedi"" with the highest expectations I've ever had for a movie, and I've seen ALOT. The film disappointed me as I expected also. I was so angry at the end of the film about that they pretty much blew us off with unnessacary sub-plots, lame twists, some stupid scenes, 1:1 copies from both episode V and VI, and an odd conclusion to Luke. 
 When I got to my friends house after I felt the movie was bad and I that pulling off episode IX as a good film would be impossible. Then I began to see Rian Johnsons vision and deeper themes being developed in this movie, the movie became better with messages about animal cruelty, capitalism, extreme anger, individualism, passion, and conservatism. 
 I also separated all the other films and looked at this film as an individual, the movie was even better.
 The worst part of this movie was by far the feeling of not knowing what the hell is going on. Johnson falls short on explaining Luke's actions and why he died, or if Rey is the next chosen one, or the Finn-Rose-Rey relationship. Another ridiculous part was Roses action to block Finn from stopping the First Orders attack, risking everybody. By the way, where's Lando, and DJ is a predictable copy of him. 
 Ok, ""The Last Jedi"" didn't reach my expectations but afterwards blew my mind. Johnson failed to capture an immediate positive response from his viewers who wanted a sequel. This movie deserves an 8.5/10 so I'm boosting it with a 10/10. Thanks.",-0.09210284664830118,0.5243572084481176

"When I left the theatre after watching THE LAST JEDI, I left with disappointment and a bad taste in my mouth. I was a little confused on weather I liked the film or not, now iv'e had time to think it all through, i've decided I did NOT like this film. I dislike this movie so much that i signed up to IMDB and this is actually my first ever review! Let's start with the good points..... The movie was beautifully shot, it had EPIC space battles, it was an action packed thrill ride, also Mark Hamill and Adam Driver's performances were excellent... but that's about it.. Now here are the reasons I did not like this movie...My BIG problem with this movie was the story and the direction the new director (Rian Johnson) has taken the franchise in. The movie answered no questions that we had from THE FORCE AWAKENS, at least not in the way true star wars fans wanted, the movie just raised more questions and alot of WTF moments. Leia did not die, they had the perfect scene for her to die and then decided to save her! Now how are they going to explain her absence in the next movie? Luke was wasted, he didnt really do anything, no training for Rey exept teaching her to lift some rocks? WOW what about training her how to use a Lightsaber properly? Then Luke Dies at the end of basically old age...they should of let Kylo Ren kill him then at least Luke has a convincing death and Kylo will gain more HEAT from the fans and look more badass....Snoke was wasted, The movie was too long but being the longest ever star wars movie you would expect there to be at least one LIGHTSABER BATTLE! But no they couldn't even give us that.....There are so many CONS that outweigh the PROS by ALOT...I really wanted to like this movie but it's so unsatisfying and my least favourite star wars film but this is not a 1/10 movie because the action scenes are really good and entertaining. The comedy in the movie was not very funny and a little insulting...RIAN JOHNSON you should be ashamed of yourself, you have completely F***ED UP Star wars, Mark Hamill even disagreed with everything Rian Johnson wanted to do with Luke's character, why couldn't Luke have one more lightsaber battle? How can RIAN JOHNSON be a fan of star wars after this awful story? I really liked THE FORCE AWAKENS....Rian Johnson took what JJ Abrams did so well in the first part and then just completely ruined it. Anyone who gives this move 9/10 or 10/10 you are not a star wars fan and you need serious help......6/10",0.10895836189953836,0.45961652726358604
"After the dark and serious ""Rogue One"" movie we get an average sci-fi comedy with light swords and apparently some Luke Skywalker.
It had some of the best fighting scenes. Overall visuals were stunning. But the plot choices (accidental romance, highly questionable key moments...) and gags/""oh cutie creatures"" just killed the vibe.
Still there are some of the best scenes I've seen in Star Wars. I personally hope there is a director's cut version without this corporate ""movie-selling recipe"" stuff.

Action was weak. Fight scenes were not memorable. Plot is dull. Bad guys hunts good guys. Good guys run. Bad guys catches good guys again, good guys run.

"The Last Jedi feels alien, out of place in the Star Wars universe we have come to love for a number of reasons. This perception is what is driving Star Wars fans to come out against the film and as a dyed-in-the-wool Star Wars fan myself, I found myself initially in agreement. The movie- as a fan- made me feel... uncomfortable. As I walked out of the theater, I was annoyed by the films total lack of resolution for some of the questions its predecessor asked, but even more irritated by the fact that some of those questions that we fans were puzzling over- making dozens of theories over- were seemingly tossed carelessly out the window.

"Despite what long-term Star Wars fans will have you believe, this film is very well made overall, and in my opinion it is in par with logan or similar modern films. There is one scene, however, that I did not like. CGI aside, the opening scene is inconsistent, random, and simply ridiculous. The basis of this scene is that one of the main characters, Poe, irrationally decides to single-handedly take on a massive star destroyer in a head-on attack. This is simply inconsistent with Poe's character, and just seems like a stupid decision. It's like they created the irrationality for this film just to draw parallels to the original 3 films. I was bugged throughout the entire film that this arrogant and frankly stupid side of Poe was just shoved in our faces. However, this is a mistake that even some classic film franchises have made (I'm looking at you DC) so I'll only take one star off for it. But in general this film absolutely blew me away. Also, some have complained about the comedy in this film. While one part seemed forced (May the force be with you), most of the comedy was modern and effective. star wars fans to go and enjoy it.

"I can understand how some people do not like this movie, however, I really did. I was never a big Star Wars fan, but I grew up with it because of my brothers. This movie made me want to go home and watch all the movies and learn everything I could about the universe. 
I did that and then I watched this movie again. It was much better the second time and I still enjoyed it. 
This new trilogy is not done yet and I think many people are forgetting that, just because some questions weren't answered in the obvious ways they were in the past films. I think this movie is beautifully done and the acting is superb (Adam Drivers acting is amazing). 
Star Wars (In my opinion) is not about the Jedi Order only, it is about good and evil, the fall of a civilization and the fight for freedom. What I think many people don't see is how wrong the Jedi actually were, they focused so much on their own light and their own path to stay good that they did not see everything change around them. 
I think there are a lot of disappointed fans because this movie took a different direction than expected. But personally, I loved it. It was fresh and had such a deep level of emotions in it that captivated not just me, but many others. The characters from the old movies are not the heroes anymore and it is time to let the past go, kill it, if you have to. 
Luke Skywalker is the last Jedi because he is the last one to try and live by the ways of the Jedi, which ended in failure again. I really hope the fans who are sad about this movie will rethink their expectations, because did you really expect Luke to be the main character again? Save the day and have another surprising father?
It is a new area, a new fight and if a new way of order is to rise, the old one has to fall. No more Jedi order and no more Sith. They have to go back to when everything was stable, to the grey area between light and dark. 
I think this movie points out these things in a beautiful way, the inner battle between light and dark, showing us one person can truly not be only one of them and there has to be a middle ground. 
Luke failed because he pushed himself so far away from the dark that he feared it when he saw it in someone else, but for a Jedi, fear is bad. So bad that Luke did not know what to do and was considering killing a young man who was conflicted and had no idea what to do. The Jedi created another villain by not embracing human errors and doubts. 
This is why I think this movie deserves 9/10, because if you watch it with an open mind and love the universe and the ideas in it, it will surprise you. Put away expectations and face reality, the Jedi are gone. ",0.10553359683794468,0.48456302151954317

"I came out of the theatre with mixed feelings. For the most part I thought it was a ""good"" movie although a missed opportunity for the new trilogy in many ways.
 There were some excellent battle sequences that used CGI well along with some beautiful scenes and a diverse colour palate. The different and darker tone that was used was interesting and refeshing, Kylo Ren changed from being a weak antagonist in the last to a more interesting character in this and I also liked the general movement and decisions the film took. Unlike many others, I was fine with the way Luke was portrayed and felt that it blended nicely with the rest of the story. 
 With all of this being said though, this movie is not without its faults and there are a considerable amount of them. 
 There is a noticeable pacing issue that lends to boring scenes and awkward transitions. I also felt that there was a level of over saturation in that they tried to fit too many characters both old and new to the film with too many subplots into a single movie. The result is time devoted to sequences with questionable relevancy to the main story and close to no character development in many characters that makes me wonder if they were included for marketing, toys, red herrings or set ups for a next instalment. 
 There is also a lack of logic or explanation for many things including how the force is used in instances, how time has past and why decisions are made by characters that seem to simply be there to pander to a lazy and convenient way to make a story arch among other small less significant parts. Needless to say, although most are not blatantly obvious, the keen viewer or one that will view it more than once will notice these are plot holes. 
 Even though the film has taken a much different direction that the others, one still cannot deny the mirroring that is throughout the film. It is nowhere near as noticeable as The Force Awakens but it is still there. you could argue that it is just a product of it being in the same universe and story line but it has aggravated me.
 There is also some comedy relief and cute creatures sprinkled throughout the film that wasn't too distracting but still felt too ""Disney"" to me and not reminiscent of the original trilogy minus the Ewoks of course. 
 I would have liked to see Rey interact with Luke more and even though I liked Kylo Ren's character in this, there still seems to be a lot missing from his story.
 Looking past my nit picking, I still feel like despite the actual significant plot points within the film, we still haven't learned a whole lot more of the story and I dread a single sequel to complete the trilogy like planned will not be significant enough to make the story seem finished. It is a good time and a casual movie that you can enjoy. Nothing outstanding but just another placeholder for the next film.",0.17748604052951877,0.5196107033063555

There were some scenes that were strange, but understandable. 
The acting was perfect in my eyes, all the actors played their part well. The effect were also excellent. For example that kamikaze attack into snokes ship was amazing. I was like omg what just happened. The music was also good. 
Personally I thought that luke will do more but anyway, it was good. His final scene with Kylo was just fantastic. Also adding Yoda was a great moment.

"To make this brief and not give spoilers away, I had heard that people were displeased with this film and said it was terrible. Well, Episode 1-3 were a tragedy for me and this was multitudes better than any of those disasters. One of the biggest criticisms involved the acquisition of this series by Disney. Many said it was merely a ploy to generate more money, through memorabilia...toys, games, clothes etc. While I can not completely disagree as they are a business and profit is essential, I by no means think they have ruined the series with this film. The only gripes I have involve someone in space floating back to a ship, and the fact that the movies made way too much of a point to show the multitude of female pilots. Before people take that as a misogynistic comment please allow me to explain. I do not care who is piloting anything, but there were many times that long shots were shown for female characters that did not have a main or even a secondary role in the film, but it felt forced the way in which it was shown. Again, I mean no disrespect in any sort of sexist manner, it merely was the heavy handed nature in which the pilots were filmed which exacerbated the perceived need to close the gender gap. Aside from that, I thought it was a wonderful film. There is evolution and a deeper understand of each of the characters in the series. It may be subtle, but there are points throughout the film that you can understand almost everyone's position, good or evil, as well as being able to relate. Without spoiling specific transitions as well as evolution's in the character's roles, they all seemed to be genuine and not forced. The actors themselves aside from the characters also did a phenomenal job at creating the emotion which is then projected to the audience, which at many points allows you to forget you are watching the movie. I have seen the previous star wars films, so this is not my first film as I know many ""veterans of the series"" will despise anything created after the original trilogy. I think it is fantastic (though do have disdain for the second set), but feel that this final trilogy resembles the feel from the original trilogy. The way it was filmed, the dialogue, and story reminded me of the empire strikes back. A final parallel is that this reminds me of the transition of the Harry Potter series, where there is still evil at the beginning of the series but it is almost more childlike. Nearing the end it become much more mature, dark, and devastating, and those pieces combine to a enjoyable culmination for me.",0.056207482993197284,0.49056122448979594

Some moments feel like a generic marvel movie. There is too much tongue in cheek humor, where it is not needed. Despite the comedic lows of this movies, the highs meet and exceed expectations. I highly recommend and would put it in my top 5 star wars movies of all time. I would also like to add one last thought... This movie is not perfect... and the original trilogy isn't perfect either... the idea behind all these movies is the experience we feel when we watch them.

Several major characters die in this movie, and because they're dead, I don't really care to see Episode IX, because whoever survived doesn't resonate; none of them really learned from their respective failures, which is replete in this movie.",0.16291666666666665,0.32500000000000007
"I left the theater thinking this movie was a pretty fun ride but I just don't understand why it wasn't cohesive to TFA? The force awakens created new characters with so much to build on and honestly, I think TFA set this movie up for success. However, this movie completely ignored Starwars elements. It was almost if Rian Johnson never saw a star wars film before including the Force Awakens. He just ignored everything Abrams built. I love all star wars even most of episode one but this felt more like a Sci-Fi action film than a star wars film. I think visually it was amazing and the acting was pretty solid. I was okay with Luke being depressed but to the point where he never redeems himself as the hero we loved was a big slap in the face to fans of star wars and Mark Hamil who agreed he didn't like the way they wrote his character. Why wouldn't you listen to Mark Hamil? Look the movie had some amazing battle scenes like the bomber scene in the beginning and the Crait planet but does that mean it was a good movie that made sense as the second installment of the trilogy? No, it doesn't. The Fans are not gonna get everything they want nor should they cause we all have different opinions but to just ignore everything Abrams created in the first movie was really disrespectful. BIG TIME SPOILERS AHEAD>
So here are a few things that TFA left us with that should have set this movie up for an amazing story. Rey's parents, The Knights of Ren, Maz Katana, Snoke, Kylos Lightsaber, Luke receiving the Light Saber at the end, Kylo's training Snoke hinted at to complete his journey to the Darkside, Finns Health, and of course Poe Dameron's journey in this. This movie didn't care for any of this or creating any cohesion what so ever with The Force Awakens. 
Snoke, although we didn't need to know who he was or why he came to being (we didn't know about Sidious in the originals) he was a major part of the first movie. His character allure that people loved, was just decimated for no real purpose other than to make Kylo seem a little more ""conflicted"". He created a link between two people which was new to the force world which was a cool element to this movie but he is simply killed by a lightsaber he couldn't detect 2 inches from him? He seemed extremely powerful in the force yet failed to witness the light saber next to him? That's just bad writing. I didn't care he died honestly it's just how he died that made little sense. Reys Parents you know I didn't mind that her parents were just nobodies it didnt bother me but what did was when she went down into the ""darkness"" on the Island that could have giving her and the fans some closure it ultimately just led to her feeling sad looking at herself. How cool would it have been to show her nobody parents leave her in a cruel way and her have to face that? Nope let's just have that moment instead it lead to nothing. That could have been an amazing turn for her character similar to when Luke is on Dagobah and has to face the ""darkness"" in the tree. They just didnt care to develop their characters other than Kylo which i liked alot in this film. FINN just wakes up as a funny joke walking through the halls with no development of his character even though it was suspenseful and meaningful in the last movie. Finn then runs into another character who I don't mind at all but it all seemed like it was forced and ultimately for nothing. Both of them were led to the casino scene which was really cool with all these different creatures some cute, some ugly, some interesting I loved it but it was all for nothing and that made it fall flat. Maz who was a really cool character from the first film gets a 30-second silly hologram scene tells Finn they have to meet this expert code breaker on this rich planet because he is the only way to get into snokes ship. So, once they get there they see the expert code breaker who btw looks like a really cool debonair type character I was excited for but he gets only 10 seconds of airtime cause they get caught which makes everything leading up to that point completely useless because it leads to nothing important to any of the characters development or the stories development. Which led to another character who could have been a cool anti hero but failed to develop into anything of interest. Waste of time for the audience and the characters. Look I can go on and on about how this film ignored the other film entirely or how it really ignored major factors from other star wars movies. This movie had some amazing scenes like the throne room and the space fights but it failed to develop the characters that Abrams created completely.",0.12558786792657758,0.526277560551754
"A visual feast above all else, this movie destroys so much of the beloved legacy that little else remains in its wake. Few reviews have been explicit enough to clearly articulate the final result of this film; one which is centered on a truly skewed vision, and executed through disrespectful treatment of the saga's core characters and themes. The manner in which the legacy characters are divisively portrayed in this Disney-helmed saga is so shocking that their very inclusion has been questioned by even Lucas himself (let alone a worldwide legion of fans). Whatever you enjoyed or loved about the original saga has been forever tainted by this film; the script's thin veneer does little to mask a strikingly seditious sociopolitical agenda that mocks its own legacy to the extent that it has totally alienated its core fan base. The central themes of a Star Wars movie has always been one of adventure, family-bond, and hope despite all odds - these are intrinsic to the legacy characters and the overall tale. The Last Jedi is the antithesis. It's delivery provides only disappointment, and a heartfelt sadness at how the beautiful legacy has been forever tainted.",0.049999999999999996,0.5981481481481481

Everything from the behavior of Luke to the lack of background of Rey, makes no sense. Why was Obi Wan speaking to her in her Force Awakens vision, if she's no one? Why did she see scenes from Luke's life? Why did Luke nearly kill Kylo Ren if he refused previously even to kill Darth Vader when he had the chance?

"The Last Jedi had all the potential in the world to not only revive a massive franchise, but to excel and be better then anything that has ever been filmed. The decision for the route which Luke took was so anti-climactic, we are talking about Luke Skywalker, one of the most single powerful beings in the entire galaxy. This story pretty much made Luke seem like he was nothing, just an older Jedi, a nobody Jedi ...... He could have become an amazing teacher, filled the story with so much more emotions and progressions.

This can be a nuisance at times but when you look at it right, it was necessary. Like I said, it was a roller coaster ride. Usually, in a standard plot process, there is a climax and I repeat a climax, but this film felt that there are several climaxes. It really depends how invested are you in the character(s) of the film, be it Leia, Rey, Kylo and of course, Luke (which I believe is the main climax of the film).

"To start off, ""The Last Jedi"" was not the worst of the Star Wars films, but it certainly did not come close to being the best. Aside from some of the poor script writing such as the useless subplot of Finn and Rose, PC blew this movie to shreds. The one scene in particular was on the casino planet when Finn and Rose freed the horse-like creatures from the stable. After riding away on the creatures, Finn asks Rose, ""Was it worth it?"" Rose takes it's harness off and says, ""Now it is."" This line made me want to jump to my death. Not only did Disney make Rose the Jar Jar of this movie that we all know and hate, but what does animal cruelty have to do with Star Wars? It seemed like a cheap trick to appeal to feminists who won't even watch the movie anyways, so why was this in there? It contributed nothing and was there for a politically correct agenda. The only parts worth seeing was the battle between Rey and Kylo vs the Praetorian Guards, and Luke vs Kylo (until you found out Luke was a hologram, which was disappointing). The fact that they killed off Snoke seemed stupid, killing Luke was downright disappointing, and leaving Leia alive to pull a Mary Poppins (if you see the movie you'll get that reference) all seemed worthless.

This film is hugely disappointing, Rey's parents, what on earth are the scriptwriters at Disney paid for?? The reveal of her parents is pathetic. This is what they should have done, she should be Luke's daughter. Her Mother should have vanished from Luke without telling him she was pregnant and he could have given her some sort of identity necklace or something similar that she passed to Rey.

"Ray Quintana · Small Business Owner at Dogparentsonline.com
I am very disapointed in this film. Yes all that you talked about regarding the mechanical items were very nice and the colors also, but the characters wandered quite a bit from the force awakens. It is has if Rian had never seen the story that makes Star Wars, the actual force, of the movie. The story line was just sloppy as if he never even saw The Force Awakens, The reason I went to go see Star Wars is because it is Star Wars and George Lucas did an excellent job of branding and continuity. When I saw this movie (especially the 2nd part of a trilogy) I expected to see the awesomeness that is Luke Skywalker training new Rey in the ways of the force and the last scene in TFA left me with anticipation of Luke truly teaching Rey the way of the light side instead of Rian's sense of humor of having Luke throw the light saber over his back and wandering into exile. The whole premise of TFA was finding Luke as the last hope for the Jedi to reborn in the excellent choice of a female Jedi. I loved everything about TFA and it is as if Rian thought the second part of the trilogy should just be a parady of everything Star Wars. Don't get me wrong when I went back to see it , and only because I had a free ticket I came back with no expectations and it made a pretty good parady of Star Wars and the hope that the kids at the end of the movie with the hope of becoming a Jedi. However I recommend that Rian and the Executives that approved his writing and directing to be fired. He said in a podcast interview he was not given any direction from the previous writer and director JJ Abrams. He said he was thrown the title and was told just write it. This is not the kind of care I have seen from Disney both in the theme parks and movies such as the Pixar disney movies. Also out of every single movie from the main story lines of ""Star Wars"" except rogue one, There was a serious lack of light saber battles. Also if the dark side was destroyed in episode six. How did the antagonist of the story establish a planet weapon at least 2000 times larger than the death star? See what I mean no continuity. I grew up with Star Wars so as long as I am alive I will go see Star Wars. I just wish Disney would put a lot more care into the making of Star Wars movies. Unfortunataly it is just not happening in the way. say, a disney pixar movie same company, different and horrible out come with the Disney Lucas arts movies. I hope the 3rd episode redeems the first Star Wars trilogy. I would hate to have the Job of fixing all of the jokes Rian brought to pass in the TLJ. I mean that guy did not even listen to Mark Hamil and that is just plain rude and disrespect full. Yes I will go see episode nine but not Han solo because of this and if you have any doubt on how TLJ did compared to the TFA I would look at the numbers. When I went the second time there was only one row of people in the theater. I am use to seeing Star Wars stay busy for at least 2 to 3 months not 2 to 3 weeks. I cannot underestimate how disappointed I am. The guy below me says he loves it and will go see it a second time. I bet he does not and even if he goes to see it a 3rd time the rest of the world is not as shown by the numbers even with out being adjusted for inflation.",0.04592748917748919,0.4804329004329004
"I'm writing a review and I never write one. It's the holidays and people need to be warned about this. 
SPOILERS AHEAD!
First off, the movie was too long, unnecessary long, the first hour passes and nothing happens, but anyway here we go. The rebellion and the republic is at war AGAIN!, you start with them ""fighting"" because of plot, little explanation whatsoever and never really caring about them. Finn could have had more story potential but somehow someone decided that they needed to add another character, pretty much for ""inclusion"", because she is chinese, add nothings to the plot with ZERO chemistry with Finn but she is his partner throughout the entire film. Rey parents background? no need to look further, there's nothing there, just a couple of drunks who sold their kid for fun. THATS IT!
Who is Snoke? some creep that liked the old stories and was a fan of darth vader and the emperor. Luke? wasted 50 years in an island drinking yellow milk and fishing. just having the time of his life. The island knowledge? we don't know, some books were there but thats it. apparently there was a hole with the dark side but nothing in there either, just an old magic mirror borrowed from Harry Potter. Poe having lots of ideas, wanting to add action to the film but because of plot he couldn't. Finn and Rey have 5 to 10 minutes together and acted like they were not longer friends. Kylo maybe is bad maybe is good, is weird but at least he got rid of that stupid mask. 
The entire movie felt forced, the plot was forced, everything is forced. the end with the kid and the ring, I see a time jump ahead. So yes Disney is milking it.

If this movie was cleaning agent that claims it cleans say calcium lime rust and you get it home and all it does is dissolve everything it touches well then you would have this movie. first you start off my seeing poe a well established character in the force awakens completely turned into comic relief and a dolt. next you have fin well established character from the prequel turned into a scared idiot they only way his character would have been revived from the distruction of his character was stopped by the next on the list rose engineer/escape pod guard. her character has no real background other than her sister was on a bombing run and died and now shes in love with fin and stopped him from doing the only redeeming act for his character. leah can use the force as a space suit i wonder in the history of jedi if they had the ability force space suit. rey and kyo use an intergalactic snapchat through the whole movie which doesnt progress there characters one bit. luke is a old hermit that drinks space milk and burns down trees before aking a force ghost confront kyo because its not like he has a parked xwing on the island or anything.admiral holdo made no sense hiding her plans from everyone then when her plans go wrong then she like omg my plan didnt work because well no one knew her plan to begin with. then she kamikaze runs the first order letting everyone see hyperspace can be a weapon so i expect the next movie all the ships will just hyperspace through each other space battle wont be a 2 1/2 hr slow crawl intergalactic oj simpson in a white bronce police chase.because this movie was so long i could probably sit here all night writing but im going to cut it off here. the trailers depicted a great movie what was delivered was a sub par toy marketing fiasco.,0.05810185185185184,0.45023148148148157

"I happen to find all the characters in this new trilogy to be charismatic and enjoyable. Is Rey a Mary Sue? Yep. Best pilot, best mechanic, beats Kylo with no training, beats jedi master Luke with no training, everybody loves her, has no real conflicts or weaknesses, to overcome, etc. I like her anyway, just based on personal charisma. Was Snokes an abortion of a character/plotline? Yep. Mysteriously powerful figure, introduced in Force Awakens, was summarily deleted without any exploration of his nature. I guess I'm ok with that, since his CGI was really bad. I can also deal with Kylo being the big bad from here on out, since he's more interesting, except he isn't overwhelming in power compared to Rey, so it will be hard to make a confrontation scary in the future. 
Supporting characters: Poe, Fin, Rose, should be allowed to be heroes, not made to seem foolish. Poe is supposed to learn a lesson to ""trust your leaders"" apparently, which is WAY out of line with the Star Wars ethos. And if you're going to do that, you'd better be damned sure the plot makes sense, which it doesn't. Admiral Holdo (military typically wear uniforms by the way, not slinky evening dresses and purple hair) had a plan she wouldn't share...then when she shared it, it was absurd. The whole ""They won't track us if we're in lifeships"" plan was just a retarded concept. Why would the audience think that was a thing? They were in visual range for gods sake, let alone sensor range. The questions pile up: Why does she self sacrifice when ships have autopilot? Why not have fleet all scatter into hyperspace since only one enemy ship has the tracking device? Why not use one ship to destroy the rest of fleet if hyperspace collisions are so effective? Why was Poe demoted for using the death of 20 soldiers to destroy around a million 1st order soldiers and a dreadnaught? It was seen as a loss when the ""leadership"" were sacrificing ships left and right for no goddamned reason? Since when do these ships run out of fuel? Never happened before in all the other episodes...never a concept. The hacker character betrays them for, I'm led to believe, enormous sums of money, for revealing the plot to destroy the tracker and telling them to ""look out the goddamned window because they've got this really clever plan to leave by lifeboat. You should blow those lifeboats up."" And do they really just reward escaped thieves with enormous sums of money when they could just shoot him? All these flawed and illogical story mechanisms are to what? Show the folly of 'seat of the pants' heroism the supporting cast were engaged in? Why is THAT a lesson we want our characters learning in the frickin' Star Wars universe? Are they going to peacefully negotiate and follow orders in the next installment? Sounds like a hoot.
Now granted, the whole franchise is not all that logical a 'verse, but it has its own internal messed up rules and logic that we've come to accept. When you break the internal rules and formulas, you draw attention to these flaws and pull the viewer out of the story. Bad idea in other words.
Final and most critical beef is Luke Skywalker: Ok, the guy's bitter and disillusioned. That's ok for a starting point. Gives the possibility for a character arc where he ends up someplace else. Well, it was a damned short arc. Went from ""Jedi must end and I don't want to help anyone"" to I'm going to use this power nobody ever heard of and go quietly ""poof"" in a way nobody anticipated after an anticlimactic battle scene that really accomplished nothing. The delay he was supposed to be providing? Wasn't necessary. The resistance left AFTER the cannon went off and destroyed the door anyway. Luke's death was such a missed opportunity to move the emotional needle of the audience, but I don't think anybody even welled up. We did't have time to realize he was even in peril. Nobody was there to witness him go ""poof"" and cry ""NO!"". Whether the power or the scene made sense or not, is the lesser sin here. There shouldn't have been a dry eye in the house and they'll never have that opportunity again. Anyone who liked this movie had no real connection to the old characters in my opinion, and had no expectations of it other than as an amusement park ride, which it did deliver, hence my 3 star rating.",0.08942700817700817,0.4866316939233605

"The Last Jedi is brilliant! Visually, emotionally, in terms of the depth of characters and their journey to firnd their place in a galaxy far far away, it brings the story one step ahead of the Cold War era black-white messages it used to carry! It is fresh, it adds a lot to the characters' arc stories! It delivers the best villain we ever got in this franchise because Kylo Ren is human, is complex and layered, he is a loose canon that turns unpredictable every moment! The Last Jedi gave us the most badass Luke Skywalker we ever got and it takes the whole story of this sequel trilogy one step further towards a very modern direction... The cinematography is just stunning, the soundtrack is great as always, and it feels really real! If you are expecting this movie to deal in absolutes and present brave flawless heroes, this is definetely not your film! But if you are looking forward to a modern touch, while still capturing the magic of the originals that we loved, then YES by all means! Go for it and don't listen to anyone! Just keep in mind that still, this is the second part, it's not the conclusion of the trilogy and there are plenty more, or even different, answers to your question from The Force Awakens!

"As a movie in the Star Wars universe, that is supposed to have a history line, a wonderful concept, and a believable drive, this movie is non sense. It becomes disrespectful. 
I can only understand people loving this movie, if they have no, or almost no attachment to any of these characters and their story arcs, and I would like to be harsh, and say that these people have no attachment to logic either, I mean, half of the movie drama was based on the miscomunication between two characters! Convinience much? They basically said the whole new trilogy is based on the fact that Luke became weak minded just because his nephew was being seduced to the dark side, and he lost all hope on him. Really? Luke? The symbol of hope on the original Star Wars? What an unwise decharacterization of the character, to say the least. Not to talk about how they trashed all the big points on the The Force Awakens. I mean, why? Hey, I know this is just a movie, and for example, I can accept how stupidily Snoke went down but, at least tell me who he is and how the hell he formed the first order! Are you making fun of the fans? Is this some kind of sick joke? These new movies have no credible reason to exist. The atrocity is abysmal. I cannot even understand how this can happen. It makes no sense to make these decisions. Was this really required to profit more with the franchise? How? Why? I want to understand. Was it more important to pass these meta-narratives about how women are also strong and wealthy people are bad? I mean, you are trying to make women look strong by telling them is alright to feel pity or have mixed feelings for an evil and unstable guy? What? Are you serious? This is what happens when you are trying to make art to get more money, and not trying to get money to make more art. You lose the consistency and essence of it.
I am so disappointed with all of this. I don't want to disrespect the people that loved the movie, but it feels like they don't see how these decisions hurt people. I mean, don't get me wrong, I too can enjoy movies that make no sense if I watch them for only entertainment porpuses but, seriously, for those who saw all the Star Wars movies, and vibed with them, dreamed with them, we can all agree that, you cannot make a Start Wars movie just for entertainment porpuses (or to pass an agenda). It must be so much more than that. Luke Skywalker teached us and inspired us to always believe in ourselves and our friends, to be build real relationships, fight for what we believe in, for who we love, who we trust, do good, be kind to all, forgive people, none of us is perfect, it's never to late to repent, don't be afraid to sacrifice... Luke Skywalker is like Son Goku, and like I like to say, ""Son Goku and Luke Skywalker are the fathers of a lot of people"", and they just turned him into a grumpy, fearful and weak guy. I don't think Ryan Johnson or Disney understand or care about any of this, because if they do, I really don't undersand what do they find good about this entrance on the saga...

For many years I fooled myself that the Star Wars is something bigger than just a simple popcorn franchise. It inspired me like nothing else. And this episode painfully dropped me to the ground. 
You telling me that this is a completely new story with new heroes. Ok, I'm not afraid of new things. And therefore this ""new"" story must be related to the original trilogy. But it's NOT at all. We have the same story about the evil Empire vs Rebels, all the efforts were made 35 years ago were nullified. Even Luke had all his character development from A New Hope wiped out. I mean he saw the light in the darkest character of the entire galaxy, Darth Vader himself, but his nephew... Nah it's worthless. 
It seems like a cheap reboot. And if the Force Awakens was fine and intriguing... this is just depressing mess. Even humour seems wrong, I mean the movie stars with the prank call to empire general who acts like a villain from the Austin Powers. The magnificent visuals, CGI and the music are all that left.

The nonsensical fluff, lack of fruition and missed opportunities of the first 2 acts had me worried until the 3rd act's redemption--a very satisfying and powerful one at that.

Snoke makes for a terrible villain (not in a good way), no where near as terrifying or sinister as the emperor and the character design is egh at best--the Gollum-esque Sith Lord doesn't do it for me. And those who compare Last Jedi to Empire have lost their Midichlorians. The most dissatisfying aspect to me was --SEMI SPOILER ALERT-- the Rey / Skywalker training scene or lack there of.

I guess when the guy who you let write and direct this film was a non-speaking actor in Rogue One, you can't expect much. I give it 2.5 of 5 stars and just as with The Force Awakens, I will likely never see it again. Even the prequel trilogy was better than this. Oh yeah one last thing, because it's now property of Disney they're trying to be all inclusive and add more diverse characters. I don't think a pointless 10 minute arc of film just to create and then get rid of a character that happens to be asian just for the sake of it is really being diverse.

This is an example of the Marvel-ified STAR WARS winking at its' own intrinsic absurdity and asking the audience to take the stakes seriously when its' central character bafflingly doesn't anymore. The reverse-engineered decision by Luke which creates the central conflict is completely out-of-character and his self-imposed exile is forced, weak, and a total head-scratcher, leaving his attempt at redemption and ultimate fate hollow, unsatisfying and infuriating to longtime fans.

Instead, I found tears of joy in my eyes, and looking over at my father to see him also choking up, because of how beautiful it was. Even my mother and niece, who have been somewhat lukewarm about previous Star Wars films, loved this one, and are looking forward to seeing it again. We honestly went home scratching our heads at why anyone would dislike it. I recently went to see it again in IMAX 3D, and loved it all over again. This is the best Star Wars film I've seen in a long time. FYI, I found Rogue One to be the worse ""Star Wars"" film and gave that a scathing review. That left a bad taste in my mouth about the direction the franchise might be headed.

I can see why Mark Hamill said he fundamentally disagreed with basically everything Rian Johnson did to Luke. What a mess. Some really odd head scratching decisions.

I also hope they give Finn and Poe a bit more to do in the next one, Finn's storyline especially didn't seem to matter all that much in this one and he was one of my favourites in TFA.

"This review contains spoilers. This was a bad movie with some interesting ideas in the middle. Small changes in the plot could have made this the best movie. Good Ideas: Luke's ability to project himself (the light side has too few abilities compared to the dark side, and a new ability, specially one that is not offensive, is great), the experience wins the boldness (Leia and Holdo had a plan that worked better than Poe's boldness, but why did they refrain from telling him the plan is a mystery), bring Yoda back to talk to Luke (but the CGI trying to mirror the original puppet was horrible. They could have used the original puppet itself, it would be a great fan service, but apparently too bold of a choice). Bad Ideas: Dropping bombs in space (there is no free fall without strong gravity and the whole scene was bad. The false sense of haste created by the need to push a button on a remote control. She could have used a voice command, droid or even a button located on the panel), Kylo Ren not killing Leia (if he turned to the light side, then I would understand this choice, but why refrain from killing and then continue in the dark side?), Kylo Ren being a good pilot (why does every Jedi also need to be a great pilot? It's the easiest way to get killed in that universe), the whole casino scene (unnecessary, time-consuming, awful soundtrack trying to mirror the cantina band in a totally different environment), every emotional scene was cut by a bad joke (Luke holding the lightsaber, Luke teaching Rey to reach out, Luke watching original Leia's hologram. Just stick with the emotional moment and let people cry!), Light speed cutting through spaceships (while this looks like a good idea, then why do you need the Death Star in the first place? They could have just used a remote controlled spaceship that goes into light speed and hit planets from the beginning), Maz Kanata (she could have been a really interesting character. Her appearance is random. It is not possible to contact any member of the Rebel Alliance, but it is possible to hologram-skype Maz in the middle of a conflict), Snoke (maybe the strongest character ever is thrown away for nothing. Someone so powerfull as to use his force remotely and convince Kylo Ren to the dark side while training with the best Jedi. We don't know where he came from, or how he got there. Plot twists are tools to tell a story. They are worth nothing by themselves) They had the chance to make this the best Star Wars movie, but made another Marvel-like comedy and left many troubles for the next director, that will have to answer for the plot mistakes made on this movie. Some small tweaks would be sufficient to make it great: Kylo Ren and Rey unite, and become Gray Jedi. Luke's projection appears to save them from Snoke and dies while Kylo and Rey escape. Kylo and Rey will train together and defeat Snoke together. Leia and Holdo tell the plan to Poe, and despite this, he goes with Finn directly to the Imperial Spaceship to try to defuse the light speed tracker, thus removing the casino scene.

"Disney's uncomfortable stewardship of the Star Wars franchise continues with the eighth episode this time directed by Rian Johnson, noted previously only for Looper.

"I was a latecomer to the theater to see The Last Jedi. After my viewing, the film left me with plenty to think about, so I went online to find critical and audience responses. What I found interested me: there was a significant disconnect between the reaction the vocal fans of the Star Wars franchise and that of the professional critics who reviewed TLJ. With few exceptions, the critical response to TLJ has been very positive. The fan's consensus however, has been ambivalent at best. Some more outspoken among that latter camp have derided the movie as a, ""Hate letter to fans,"" or have posted volgs titled, ""The Rot at The Core of Star Wars."" Looking into the causes of this disparity, I find that many authors posit that the longtime fanbase-predominantly white males-feel threatened by the large number of prominent women and nonwhite characters featured in the cast. While in many cases this is true, (I recall an IMDB audience review that labeled newcomer Rose as, ""Positive Body Image Girl,"") I find it a shallow and dismissive theory in most cases. When I viewed Last Jedi, I saw a film that was exciting and mechanically excellent with only a handful of visual miscues. At the same time, I saw a film that is nowhere near as socially progressive and empowering as it gets credit for and it squanders every possible opportunity to depict a better, more exciting story.",0.20891465677179963,0.4995176252319109

"I dont write reviews that much and havent wrote one for the TFA because i was divided in opinion. I didnt know wheter to like it or hate it. Now i know. But this time i have to defend the movie because it didn t deserve the hate it got.
Everybody in the movie tried their best including new director who brought some fresh ideas and turnovers in storyline which i found very interesting. I think we shouldnt blame the director because JJ Abrams played it safe in the first one and thus made it dificult for anybody who was next in order to direct. 
In TFA Abrams made a copy of new hope and except the character of Kylo Ren and much needed return of Han solo and Chewie didn t give us anything exciting ,intriguing or fresh. Instead he gave us a copy of luke skylwalker in female form , copy of a death star , copy of r2d2 , same enemies (stormtroopers,supreme leader) bla bla the list goes on. I have to add that the biggest problem was that characters were bad. I didnt feel connected with Rey , Finn was also very boring and non charismatic didnt care about him , maz katana also felt very unneeded , Poe was mediocre at best , Snoke non present .... Final battle was also very cartoony...
Having exposed all these problems i have to say that it was very difficult for a new director Rian to step in to this mess. And i think he was very brave to follow his vision and tried to do something different. He gave us the longest movie, he gave us very gritty Luke , he made us care for the villain Kylo Ren , he killed of the main villain which was a ballsiest and very cool move in my opinion. It wasnt a great film but after that mess disney and JJ have started in TFA i think it is the best we could have got.
This film has few bad elements .For example we dont see lightsaber fights that much anymore which should be the crucial part of every star wars movie. We should have always have more of these fights and duels and somehow they keep making less and less. I dont understand this. And big spoiler ahead , they shouldnt have killed of Luke , much better way to go would be to leave Luke for one more movie and let Leia rest deservingly in peace.",0.11171420083184787,0.47958110516934066

"Me and my son are a huge fans of the Star Wars and Episode VIII was the most awaited event of the year for us. But After watching this movie, I was a little confused. 
At first I rated this movie with 8 stars and it's very good in my book. But still there was something disturbing, something what was not present in the previous episodes. 
Because I am a Star Wars fan, I don't care about mistakes like gravity in space (when bombers dropped their load and those bombs fall straight down like they would fall on earth) and I am ok even with princess Leia's unbelievable survival - although it was one of those main reason why I lowered my points. It would have been totally acceptable if Leia have died there. What I mean by that, is that even Leia's death would have been better than this, where she were flying to the ship like true Disney princess. As we all know from previous episodes, even Jedi can die. But miracles happens and as I said, I am fine with it. But the for most main reason for lowering my points was the inappropriate jokes here and there. For shore those jokes were funny and I laughed for them as all the viewers did, but every time after that I find myself thinking ... really!! What kind of movie I am watching? Don't be mistaken. Star Wars has been always fun but this time it was so noticeable and it was too much for me.

Two years ago when The Force Awakens was impending, I spent 6 Friday nights in a row with my daughter watching Phantom Menace through Return of the Jedi. It was Painful. Painful. The Last Jedi is an amazing Film and stands alone but does a spectacular job nodding to the previous stories and including the legends from a galaxy far far away, a long time ago. Jedi seems its happening in real time. The strife, fight, and charactesr are muscular and vibrant while keeping with the campy tradition of the previous films. Adam Driver is a panther as Ren. The conflict with he and Ridley as Rey is the stuff that would launch a franchise in any other . . . galaxy. Isaac and Gleeson continue to pay their dues for being extraordinary performers, just flat out nailing roles which are below their capabilities. I don't like Star Wars, but his movie was AWESOME.

"Whilst I fully accept and understand the disappointment of many fans writing reviews of The Last Jedi on here, I can only assume that much of the disappointment stems from their desire for the saga to keep on using the same old formula and see the plot twists and turns follow the same pattern as the original trilogy. The Force Awakens was good, but very much weakened by its close adherence to the originals (for example, nothing presented in TLJ is as bad a misstep as the dreadful repetitive muddle that was the Starkiller Base); TFA was enjoyable blockbuster filmmaking but fell short of greatness. Disney were quite right to let Rian Johnson take risks here, and it have really paid off with the most surprising and intelligent Star Wars film since TESB. ",0.05090062111801243,0.4816977225672879
"Of course TLJ was a bad movie because TFA set it up to be a bad movie. J.J. had a clean slate to work with...George Lucas had his hands tied in the prequels because certain events had to take place in a certain order. Like I said...J.J. Abrams did not have that problem. It made no sense what so ever to not have Luke play a major role in TFA...the opening scene should have had him in it for goodness sakes. Anyone who saw episodes 4,5, and 6 knows that Luke would not go off on an island all alone for God's sake. Luke was a warm hearted person who loved family...only makes sense that he would have fallen in love with someone and had a family of his own. That old law of the Jedi not being able to love died with Luke...look how powerful the offspring of a Jedi turned out to be for goodness sakes. My plot for TFA would have been the movie opens with Luke at the funeral of his wife..at his side would have been his two 8 year old twins....a girl(grows up and is played by Daisy is fine) and a boy played by whoever. His daughter would have been good of course but his son would have always been 50/50...Luke never really understanding his son. Then you could have introduced Ky Lo Ren and from birth he would have been the bad seed of Han Solo. After the death of his wife, Luke and his son grow further apart and we see Luke's son becoming closer and closer with his fun yet troubled cousin Ky Lo Ren. They could have build the story off of that and at some point Luke's son and Ky Lo Ren join the dark side and become very powerful and it's all about trying to get them back to the good side of the force.

This movie tries too much with a lot of cheesy jokes to cater to the younger kids who might be new to Star Wars, leave it to Disney to make Star Wars too little kid friendly. The plot is a mess and switches so much and is all over the place. Without going into giving away too much of the movie, there is a character that is introduced and the way the character dies is stupid and you are supposed to feel an emotional connection, but I felt as there wasn't enough character development to care about her. Kylo Ren's actor is a terrible actor and if you thought he was bad and whiny in the last one, it's even worse than this. The trailers made this look to be amazing, but it was total crap and was such a disappointment. I enjoyed The Force Awakens and had high hopes but this movie close to destroyed all of the greatness of the original trilogy.

"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a challenging, bold, and different movie than many expected. While critical response has been extremely positive, it seems general audiences are having more divisive views on the film. Some applaud it as the best entry in the series since the release of Empire Strikes Back, while there are others who claim it is the worst entry in the entire series. For me personally, I believe in the years to come Last Jedi will be looked back upon as one of the greatest Star Wars films, and one of the greatest sequels, ever made. It's been interesting to see the audience response since many who feel disappointed seem to forget, or were just never aware, that this kind of reception is the exact one received by Empire Strikes Back when it was first released. People were divided on that as well. It wasn't until the original trilogy ended that fans looked back on it so fondly, as do I (Empire is not only my favorite Star Wars film but also my favorite film period.) So like everyone who went to see Last Jedi opening night I did indeed have high expectations. Force Awakens was the film that brought Star Wars back to it's former glory, and Last Jedi elevated it even further. It is gracefully written and directed by Rian Johnson, giving us some of the best visuals we've ever had in a Star Wars film, as well as a gut retching story about self discovery, loss, coping, dealing with hate and revenge, and inner demons. This a movie not afraid to make you think and, more importantly, feel. You will have emotional reactions to this film and that exactly what the filmmaker wanted, whether you like those reactions or not. It's redundant to talk about what a stellar cast the movie has. From Daisy Ridley's Rey to Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, they all do a phenomenal job here, including Oscar Issac, who was sorely underused in Awakens, as Poe Dameron. His arc is one of the more interesting ones, whose resolution goes against normal ""hotshot pilot"" cliche's. The weakest, but by no means is a weak performance, of the cast would be John Boyega's Finn and the newly introduced Kelly Marie Tran's Rose. Their plot meanders as they're sent on a side quest of sorts, but the resolution leading to the climax helps save this subplot. As most have agreed, the stand outs are the late Carrie Fisher in her final performance, which was beautifully poetic and wonderfully performed, and Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, who gives the greatest performance of his career thus far. Luke is not the same wide eyed boy from the original trilogy hoping for a greater purpose. He is a broken man who has had tragedy strike his life. Much like Empire, this is a darker entry in the series, but still has a feeling of hope throughout it. It may not be easy for some to accept yet, but in time I feel The Last Jedi will indeed be recognized as a great film that holds up to the lofty standards of it's predecessors, just as I see it today.",0.21077891591976097,0.5274413145539906

The originals were small films filmed on claustrophobic sets; victims of budget restraints and SPFX limits - but that's what endeared them to us as well.

"I personally enjoyed some of the acting of the characters. The score seemed good to me. John Williams always does an excellent job. The visuals are stunning, but I feel that is to be expected from any modern film. 
The script is not great. The story is awful. There are way too many holes in the storyline, too many subplots, and the characters are underdeveloped. In fact, a lot of characters don't matter at all or don't hold any weight so I could become attached to them. The characters everyone loves, well everyone but the director and writers I guess, don't matter and are disrespected in how they are used. I like Finn but he plays no important role in this movie unlike TFA. When he is about to do something important he is stopped by Rose, a new character which I find useless. I still don't understand how Rey is so good with the force with the little training she has. I'm fine with that anyone can have the force, but come on.. Rey is acting like she is grand master Yoda or something. Check more detailed reviews and they will explain what I mean. I agree with pretty much every review I've read on here. 
I liked TFA even though I did notice its similarity to ANH. It had questions to be answered and brought back Star Wars with a new hype. It had momentum. TLJ doesn't give a rat's as* about TFA, and all those questions you had about TFA are given dumb, lazy answers, OR NO ANSWERS AT ALL.
This movie saddens me as a Disney fan but more importantly a Star Wars fan.
I like Disney, but I guess it's true that they really just care about money, even when it is something as important as Star Wars. They tarnish the universe I love so much. This movie I feel is made just for a crowd that wants to go see a sci-fi action movie, NOT A STAR WARS MOVIE. Other people must be right. Critics must be paid off by Disney because this movie sucks.
I was entertained though, but actually started laughing in the movie at how dumb some of it was. I give it a 5 instead of a 3 mainly because I love Star Wars. I feel like this is the start of the end for the franchise. Side films such as Rogue One may be able to survive though, as they can still be deep in the Star Wars universe and remain interesting.
P.S. ---- Disney, please fire Rian Johnson and the whole board of writers. Give George Lucas a deal, even if he wanted to bring back Jar Jar I'd be down because there would at least still be a story.

To much comedy? Really, are you really fu&^&^ 'Star Wars' fan because all 'Star Wars' movies have comedy on them. Tell me how many jokes you counted on 'The last jedi' and I can count the jokes in every one of the old movies.
Do you guys remember C3PO and R2D2? Yoda trolling Luke?
The way they portrait Luke? I may agree on this one but besides some moments he was kind afraid of Ray's force, he really kicked ass on this one and even without getting out of the island. Could give me a light saber fight? Maybe but Mark Hamil's performance was great. 
Snoke's dead could be play a little better but the scene was a better version of the emperor's death. 
Poe was great, Leia was great. 
Finn and Rose story was more filling and was probacly my only big complaint about the movie, the scene felt more like a 'Battlestar Galactica' than a 'Star Wars' scene but I guess movies these days can't avoid the romance.
General Holdo's scene was spectacular but overall was a maybe unnecessary character but maybe because Carrie Fisher's death they used her the way they did. 
Benicio del Toro? Why he is even in this movie? 
The cinematography was spectacular.
The special effects amazing.
The music? Awesome.
The acting? Very good.

I had a few problems with this movie. But, I consider them minor problems. Not on the level where I feel that Star Wars is ruined forever!! Biggest issue being I felt the reveal of who Rey's parent's were was a disappointment as of now at least. Also the Lukes role in this movie wasn't quite what I was expecting. But, over all it's a very enjoyable Star Wars movie. If you want to talk truly bad, go watch Attack of The Clones.

"I've read the commentaries and had gone full of conviction that Disney had ruined it, so I was ready to see the disaster and went yesterday to the movies; surprisingly and fortunately, I was wrong in my expectations as this movie gave me profound feelings and connection to the other ones, and now I think that most people who abhorred it just haven't catched the big picture. What is most grand about Star Wars is its philosophy: this movie has brought up again the Force cosmology, with concepts from Buddhist, Hinduist, Judeochristian and Taoist traditions. I wasn't expecting a part where Luke would teach lessons, and I got surprised in such synthetic way that the Force was managed to be presented and explained as a cosmic regulator that balances the natural laws and the antagonisms and consequences of the beings' free wills, and thus the movie adds more to it and helps to give understanding that it brings harmony by intervening according to each one choices to the dark or light side. Harmony where it is apparently chaos, balance in opposites, recurrence of life, death, freedom, limitations - learning and enlightenment events until sentient beings arise by means of providential opportunities and serve to give other opportunities to new fellow beings. Luke said it all, the Force isn't just about lightsabers, fights and floating things (and maybe those are the things that some fans gave more importance to and felt for their lack in the movie), it exists by itself and manifests through those who can bring harmony at the moment; and Luke wasn't a coward or deserter, just as he told his mistake was done in a moment of pure instinct, of fear of losing what he created and loved, so he made a choice in an instant, and although he regretted it right after and couldn't have imagined what would happen, he was trained and taught according to the Jedi lessons to know that one shall not give way to bad emotions and by them commit decisions to destroy others, since this perpetuates the dark side. So why wasn't he able to control himself? He got grieved about the way he had learned and his power weren't enough to avoid it, so in pure torment he exiled himself to order things up with himself, like an internal fight with reformulation of old concepts, he saw he had to find other ways than those he was trying, and die like this in oblivion if unsuccessful, but he haven't lost connection to the Force since he advanced a deeper understanding of it and Yoda was accompanying him. That can be a moral lesson to our lives and shows deeply the human potential, that no matter how trained we think we are there are moments when although we sight what brings bad consequences we still haven't reasoned enough to change ourselves, master the instincts and then we fall, but yet there is a teleological order that makes bad turn out to become good, since it is what can make even ""failure the greatest teacher"". It has happened during other moments in the saga with other Jedi, showing that masters can fail that at any stage in their Jedi discipline, but it seems like some fans negate this emotional aspect and want to see them as if they were flawless machines that had already controlled all of their human nature by negation and not by conducting them to an optimal point, or who think it is easy to keep with the Force once one reached it, instead of being a lifetime process of challenges (look at Yoda, he is good humored even as a Force ghost, that shows how he achieved the integrality of his nature, emotions and individuality, without self-annihilation, just self-improvement along his 800 years). Luke died with all his potential, spending all of his energies in a Force projection that kept not only his legend but the way of the Force going on, in a more powerful way than would be a lightsaber clash (like when Ben Kenobi simply went calm with Vader, knowing it would be better that way and that his spirit would continue one with the Force, acting as part of it, knowing how it works, guiding people and appearing in decisive moments). About the location map, it can be explained as something Luke created before going hermit.
The other controversy is Rey, who appears to frolic effortlessly with Force abilities, and that seems like the same backlash Anakin had in the prequel trilogy, when he was born with a spontaneous load of midichlorians. Also, people didn't like the explanation about her parents, which seemed to have given it a sudden end. Regarding these questions, people have forgotten one theory, in which just like Anakin and the Chosen One prophecy, she may have been Force-conceived, without parents (Force parthenogenesis?), like the part where she encounters herself in the mirror can suggest, when she asks who her parents were. The midichlorians were an interesting addition to the Star Wars universe and are at first incomprehensible because they don't seem to link with the soul and the natural omnipresent Force: that is because we tend to ignore the spiritual realm of Star Wars, ""death, yet the Force""; who knows about it? People are born with a capacity of Force sensitivity that is normally directly proportional to the quantity of midichlorians and can be estimated by it, but the confusion comes when considering them to be the cause of it while we cannot affirm that. Instead, it enrichens beautifully the Star Wars cosmos by pointing to the existence of patterns which are derived along the many forms amidst the Force and that make their interconnection, turning out to be a correspondence between matter and spirit granting the soul to manifest its inner capacity of sensing and channeling this natural energy while one is within the body, in a way that it can be developed with more or less intensity, according to the needs, natural selection or whatever. Now we can deduct philosophically by that some directions that this new movie can head to, like the previous effort of one's progress with the Force through the pre-existence of the soul, as can be suggested by Yoda opinion of Rey, and that can lead to other developments - reincarnation for instance - concepts from Hinduism, Buddhism and some Judaism interpretations. It would be like a preparation of the body for the soul (explaining then the Chosen One prophecies and a Force mechanism of harmonization) in the material world and a physiological ressonance manifestating through the midichlorians would allow the body to support one's power and to produce organic correlates when one uses the Force, thus its potential and resistance could be scientifically measured (as was done by Qui-Gon), and like a wave-receiving instrument such as radio or TV people with midichlorians can synch more easily or hardly, and can be trained or not, but while they may be limitating factors midichlorians are not the only condition nor warranty for the person to be powerful, Force sensitivity would then be a personal acquired skill (during life or before it). It is just like macro and microcosm, and it holds analogy in our world in explanation for phenomena like mediumship (like some researchers and studies hint at, Peres and Newberg (2013) ""Neuroimaging and mediumship: a promising research line"" and Peres et al. (2012) ""Neuroimaging during Trance State: A Contribution to the Study of Dissociation"").",0.13941772513201087,0.516871224014081

"I have a lot to say about the last Jedi, and due to my thought process i can almost guarentee i wont list in order. I just want to share my opinion, and I don't care if it's read or not. I don't think I have ever been more disappointed with a movie than I was seeing it yesterday. I almost felt compelled to write this review because i just cant bear the thought of this having higher than a 8.0 on this website, but I can see it is already dropping and for that i am glad. First impressions were okay, as always. But like I always do, I thought about what I had just watched for a full day, and i have realized several things. This was SO disappointing because I can always tell when movies are going to be good, and when they are going to be bad. I fully expected this to be a fantastic movie for a few reasons. I thought Disney couldn't mess up a franchise this large. I was wrong. I thought the studio could pick a director that knows star wars well enough to handle it well. I was wrong. I thought the 2 hour and 32 minute runtime meant it would almost have to have a reliance on plot rather than action alone. I was partially wrong. By this I mean there was a lot of new development in the plot, but not really in a good way. In fact, I would go so far as to say they could have cut an entire short sequence out of the movie without any negative effects. The best way i can describe this scene is like it's another podrace from episode 1. It really had no place in the movie, took up at least a half hour, and was included an overly elaborate solution to an otherwise simple problem that just happens to be solved in 30 seconds after the obvious visual rhetoric of a scene's plan fails. This was a waste of a solid half hour of runtime. A space battle is a pretty great introduction to a star wars film, but not when the cliche literal cliffhanger detonator, and lame ""humor"" are more memorable than what happens in the real introduction. My introduction to the movie was an intended suspenseful shot that fell flat, a first order general breaking character and turning into an idiot, and Leia turning into Mary Poppins. This was followed by the most disgrace possible to do to one of the most loved characters in star wars. This was Luke. Or maybe it wasn't, as he was literally nothing like the luke everyone remembers from 1977-1983. Mark Hamill explaining how much of a disservice luke was done should have been a red flag. This new Luke would rather squeeze green milk out of an alien tiddy than bring balance to the force once again. Maybe murder his own nephew in the process. Not even the plot twist of Ren killing Snoke to save Rey could save it, but maybe that's because we saw nearly exactly the same thing in Return Of The Jedi. (Think Darth Vader, Palpatine, and Luke) There were probably 2 parts of this movie I liked, Yoda coming back, (and actually talking correctly like the OT), and the 10 brief seconds of that Pink haired lady (shows how memorable of a character she is) blasting through the First Orders fleet at light speed. This silent, monochromatic clip was a thing of beauty, possibly the best part of the entire film. Another part I liked was the cinematography of Luke's death, as it was subtle enough to not be obvious, but beautiful enough to perfectly close out Luke's story in exactly the same way it began in A New Hope. Gave me chills. With that said, I still disagree with the way it happened. I don't think Luke needed to die. With only 3 main original cast members, 2 are now dead on screen, and one can't return because tragically she is dead in reality. I know I had more to say but this is already nearly a mile long and I've gotten my point mostly across, so I'll conclude with this. All things considered, the last Jedi was terrible. Perhaps more disappointing than the actual movie, is not knowing who to blame for it. Disney? Rian Johnson, Perhaps? The writers? Oh that's Rian Johnson. Probably him because Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Frank Oz, Daisy Riddley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac were great.",0.08785173160173161,0.5035475553857908
"Okay so my first problem with it is how they character assassinated Luke Skywalker, he was THE Jedi Master and instead, he became an old man who complains about everything, then they killed off Snoke before we even got to see what he could do, then they kill off Luke but not Leia really? Sadly Carrie Fisher is no longer with us so I'm surprised Leia is still alive and Luke isn't. Also, the whole thing with Rey looking into the Mirror of Erised from the first Harry Potter was pointless and stupid and did not do anything for the plot. AND they killed off the potential of who Rey's parents could have been. JJ Abrams even said he told Daisy Ridley who her parents were and that they were something big. And then this new director just completely killed that idea. Phasma once again had only seven minutes of screen time and it ticks me off, I love Phasma and Gwendoline Christie and they just keep on wasting her awesome character. She is so much cooler in the comics. AND MY FINAL problem with the film was how Rose saved Finn, it made the whole him being a martyr thing stupid because we all knew he wasn't going to die. Now it wasn't all bad so here is what I loved and honestly what gets it a six from me and not a four. I loved how they went more in depth with the actual Star Wars Universe by that I mean the creatures and the planets. It totally felt like star wars, I like how they did Ben Solos turn to the Dark Side and why it happened, and I liked Poe's character development in this film. We didn't get to see that a lot in VII so I'm glad they made up for it in VIII.",0.10353896103896104,0.5907251082251083

"The Last Jedi is a fantastic ride from start to finish! Johnson takes the story in very unexpected directions which only add depth to the franchise. Without going into detail, while the movie may have crushed a number of closely held fan speculations, it is an intense ride from start to finish and introduces themes yet to be fully explored in the Skywalker saga. These mainly enhance the tale and others leave questions still unanswered but hopefully will be in the final chapter. Some unhappy with the movie may be disappointed with their theories going unfulfilled and for some others, attention to progressive issues in the film may be clouding their assessment of the movie.

"The Last Jedi is a great action-adventure movie. A real thrill ride of a movie. But is it Star Wars? My answer is emphatically no. TLJ pays homage to Star Wars and even parodies the saga. But is not the Star Wars I grew up with. It is meta-Star Wars. It is the cast of Star Wars appearing on the Muppet Show and playing themselves and also versions of their movie characters. But none of this took me out of the moment. Not even Luke actually referring to his lightsaber as a ""laser sword"" or Leia's first words to her brother. ""I changed my hair"". And the two big reveal scenes actually had me laughing. What does Luke do with the lightsaber after Rey hands it to him? He chucks it over his shoulder like it's a piece of garbage. And Rey is nobody. Her parents were nobody. And the director himself has confirmed that Kylo wasn't lying. So get over it, fan boys. There won't be a ""I am your father (brother, uncle)"" moment in Episode 9 and you no longer need training or a Jedi master to become a full Jedi. Decades of SW mythology flushed down the crapper and a million fan boys (and girls) crying in their parents basements and hugging their Chewbacca plushies. And none of this bothered me because the cast is completely solid and the story is so well paced and mostly exciting. Some people disliked the jokes and the casual 2000'ish banter that carried over from TFA but I would rather hear that than a bunch of ""space talk"" delivered with as much nuance and subtlety as you would find in a high school play. No, TLJ isn't your daddy's Star Wars but it's a very good movie that is worth seeing with your entire family. Do it.",0.1407222222222222,0.44002777777777763

Somebody even said he cried during the film. What! Man, I ""cried"" through almost the entire Episode 1, 2, 3 saga. Remember the Phantom Menace? And if you remember, the script of the previous Star Wars, The Force Awakens was almost a rip off of the Episode 4. And come on, Star Wars was never about the complicated story....but about how that story is written and told. And this episode does it very well.
This movie is fantastic. Well paced. Simple story but greatly told. I don't care about MH's opinion about Luke. I think the writing was fantastic. The story on the island took enough time to build. That was a high point on the movie. Maybe too much comedy, but I don't mind to laugh once in a while. 
And the cinemathography was superb. I won't go into details about effects. That would be easy. Just talking about photography, about images, colours used, takes, stunning, really a masterpiece.

"Anyone can have their own personal opinions about the Star Wars saga, but I personally believe all of the hate from this film comes from the people who grew up watching the original films. I do personally believe that the original films are still better than The Last Jedi but this film doesn't sit far behind. I grew up in the time of the prequels and I loved them then and they play a big part in the story and even though they were hated they still tie the saga together, just like this new trilogy. People need to understand that even though Luke Skywalker was portrayed in a disappointing way which I felt as well, this film is trying to set up for the new characters such as Rey and Kylo Ren, which has easily the best fight scene I have seen in Star Wars, the way light and dark came together in the film and then were split apart from their different choices was great. Yoda clearing up the prequels was a very good addition to the film because it gave an understanding to it and a great deal of coverage. Something that people seemed to hate is Snoke and how pathetic his death is, which I thought when watching it but then later on in the film it shows that it made Kylo Ren more angry and make him seek more power which will make the ninth film extremely good. I do believe that Rey and Luke's scenes needed to be more important than Finn and Rose which had a plot which officially went no where. ",0.14766835016835017,0.6205303030303031

The new characters are terrible, the direction they took the plot in is terrible. It seemed to me like the creators went into the movie with a checklist of ""messages"" they wanted to get across to the audience and then created a movie out of it, rather than carefully crafting a meaningful story.

"This movie...
If you are a diehard fan, hear me out. I am a huge fan of Star Wars, and in my opinion this film offered all of the right twists. It was not perfect, but there were so many things that they got right with this movie.
Firstly, Luke Skywalker. A lot of people were very angry about how his character was handled. However, it makes logical sense when you follow the events of what happened before TFA. And it also made sense from a plot point of view in terms of things with Rey (if you go see the film you will understand what I mean). 
Secondly, the storyline with Rose and Finn. I would agree that one or two elements of this storyline did drag, however it was in no way unnecessary, it made a really powerful statement about how these wars between the First Order and the Resistance works in terms of galactic economy which is not really mentioned a lot in Star Wars. Rose is not necessarily a character everyone will fall in love with, some of the parts between her and Finn were cringe-worthy but that was deliberate. She is nevertheless important still as a character.
Finally, the last criticism which I noticed a lot of people had was ""plotholes"" in the actual main storyline that connected everything together. While I agree it could have been handled better, it actually was very suspenseful and had a great build-up. ",0.14377125850340136,0.5927295918367347

"Ok let me start by saying, yes, this film is flawed, I acknowledge that, but I greatly enjoyed it, and it was full of surprises. It was well shot, the music was good, the acting was fine, and the effects were great. I find that people complained that The Force Awakens was too similar to A New Hope, and now they are complaining about The Last Jedi being too different. We can't always be fed the same thing over and over again. I myself enjoyed the use of Snoke as a plot device for Kylo to overthrow, because even if Snoke revealed who he was to Rey, that would not have changed anything, and Snoke would still have been killed two minutes later. As for Rey, I like that she does not come from special heritage. I know a lot of crying fanboy theorists hated this, but I am a huge fan of stories where a hero comes from nothing.

"My expectations were high about this movie, but I couldn't be more disappointed. The story was too simple and boring. Finn and Rose could have benn cut out entirely and nothing would have been changed at all. It was too long anyway. The jokes were forced, although sometimes they were funny, but overall just ruined the experience. I really missed a lightsaber duel from the movie, that would been great. Overall the action and the visuals were great (except a puppet's ghost, that looked strange for me..) and some scene were epic, but Star Wars should be more than a stunning action movie. The characters were boring and acted stupid, there were more plot holes than in the Force awekens and I couldn't belive, that is literally possible. The movie was too long not to put some twist in it, but these were the worst opportunitys, any fan theory would make it better. Although I trust in Rian Johnson, and hope he will make a better trilogy if it's his own project from beginning to end. And J.J. better fix the mistakes, but I think some year later this trilogy will be the worst from the three and people will appreciate the prequels more, because what Disney does just terrible.",0.020285714285714296,0.5763469387755102

"DiverseDiverseWith the new addition of Star War making its appearance this weekend, everyone (Including me) have hit the theaters in hope after seeing the 93% on rotten tomatoes that this will be the Star Wars that brings back the series. After watching The Last Jedi I agree with what Luke was saying the whole movie it's time for the Jedi to end. And what I mean by the ""Jedi"" I mean the Star Wars series as a whole. AT THIS POINT DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THE FILM TO BE SPOILED. The movie started like a now typical Star Wars film, with many people dying on both sides and a few ""heroes"" giving up their life's for the resistance (which is pretty much the knock of version on the Republic). Although the scene was captivating to watch, it skewed typical Disney/Marvel opening scene. I give the whole movie a 6/10, like bad parts there was some good parts. For example, the best part of the episode was when the five second commander of the Resistance light speeded her ship into the ""Empires"" main vessel destroying both ships.. ( The main ship of the Republic that was seen throughout the series, so it was ""a hit at home"" type of lose for all the true Star Wars fans.) Besides that sense and one other, The Last Jedi seemed like Disney was trying so hard to not to be predictable and failed. The cast, of course, contained some from pervious episodes like Rey (The most annoying character of series in my opinion), Princess Leia, Finn, Snoke, Ben Solo, and Luke Skywalker. It also introduced new characters like Rose and Codebreaker, and to be honest these characters were nothing but filler and fresh faces to make the series look my diveres",0.08945887445887446,0.4704978354978355

As mr.Hamill said in an interview,it's not important if it's high quality, all it matters is IT MAKES MONEY, screw the quality, screw the characters etc. There were scenes i liked in this movie, such as those force conversations between rey and kylo ren, but unforunately the bad outweighs the good by a long shot here. Firstly, you hire a new director who only has done a couple of movies, and you give him the control of one of the biggest and one of the most iconic franchises in movie history. Secondly, Finn and Rose are completely irrelevant to the plot. If they have removed them from the movie and their pointless ""crusade"" , it would have been a shorter and possibly better movie. Like i said before, this movie was made just to make money, period. I think most people will agree that that Leia flying scene in space was just so ridiculous. At that moment when that ship blew up, i was like oh didn't expect they would kill her so soon, then came that superman/witch flying sequence. And so much forced humor in this movie. Star wars isn't supposed to be a comedy movie, yet you have to add stupid scenes pretending to be marvel or something. I could go on and on about this, but i think i have said my piece.

Find a Code Breaker in the casino that would allow to enter the First Order barrier to then disable the tracking device. Finally, this would make it possible to the Rebels to escape. But all those efforts, turned out to be pointless, as the real plan was to just go to a nearby base.

"The Last Jedi had a lot of pieces of what could have been a good movie and then instead of becoming one kept adding more and more and more. Most likely due to the criticism the Force Awakens got for being too much like A New Hope, The Last Jedi really wanted to keep the audience spinning and not be The Empire Strikes Back. Unfortunately more is often not better. Also, it is not always a good idea to try and beat something that already was amazing. 
 Sure a lot of people were kept guessing and were surprised by decisions but a good movie needs a good story and good characters and general cohesiveness. The entire movie came off like a group effort mad lib of sci fi and action ideas mushed together in a giant mess. Parts were pretty but as a whole it was not well shot, poor directing detracted from an awesome cast of actors who acted wonderfully. Most of the criticisms I've seen before are petty jabs at individual decisions such as whether or not a character should have died or that a theme was bad etc. The really problem was there were too many good ideas that were squeezed together in an inartful manner into a confusing mess that created a story that lost all of its continuity with the previous movie/movies in the long series it was supposed to be a part of. ...And several VERY BAD ideas. Literally there is an entire plot line that was a senseless waste of time and I think deleting it from the movie as a whole would have left me enjoying the movie far more.
 I hear all the people who claim that those critical of this movie are die hard fans who didn't like their expectations of Star Wars go unmet. While I admit that I am a true fan (let's please pretend Episode I never existed...), I was only let down by how not good this movie was as a whole. I did not enter the movie with any pre-existing expectations of who should live or die or what any of the answers to the questions left by The Force Awakens should be but left the movie greatly disappointed and upset. I can think of really only one positive thing this movie had to bring to the table: the development of Poe's character that was left sadly dismissive in the Force of Awakens but in all other manners this movie fell flat.
 First of all, to really surprise me as a viewer I shouldn't have all answers to all questions given to me in the middle movie of a trilogy. The middle needs to be the biggest cliffhanger of a trilogy. The first part is the scene setting and the middle is the rising action leading to the climax and resolution. While seemingly insurmountable devastation abounded in this movie, with all character and plot questions neatly tidied up it does not leave one just not being able to wait until the next episode. Secondly, many characters completely abandoned all character development made in previous movies. The most notable is the story of Finn. For a character who grew from cowardice to heroism in the Force Awakens pretty much nothing that that Finn did or said made much sense in his character arch. It really seemed like the director didn't like the development of Finn so started from scratch with the same general idea. It just didn't make sense. 
 Thirdly, while I appreciate some of the more progressive themes that were attempted it felt like a stew of morality rather than a part of the movie as a whole. Pretty much none of us like cruelty to children, or animals or corrupt wealthy people etc. etc. but it would have been nice to see like one strong idea besides the word ""hope"" repeated unnecessarily like a broken record when the story wasn't the sort to really lead there yet, instead a smattering of snippets of moral themes not flushed out well at all. I felt the same thing with the characters. This movie added countless named characters who had approximately five minutes on screen to do something pointless and ultimately just detracted horribly from the story as a whole. Each additional character by themselves was a decent possible addition but the creators needed to pick just like 1-2 and really develop them instead of wasting time on the others. A movie isn't like Game of Thrones where season after of season or chapter after chapter can tie together seemingly unconnected events and people; they had 2 1/2 hours to tell us a story and I left unsure of what that story was and terrified at what they might do next.
 Finally, this was supposed to be a Star Wars movie. That doesn't mean the expected needed to happen but it should have felt like part of the Star Wars story as a whole. I couldn't keep track of whether I was watching Battlestar Galactica, Sliders, Tarzan, or Casino Royale and that is problem. I am very glad that JJ Abrams is coming back for the finale. I can think of no one better to fix this mess and let Star Wars end in the epic manner it should, worthy of all those shouty words dramatically marching across the screen to John Williams deserves.",0.09964506172839496,0.48252865961199304
"From the beginning the film grates with my new Jar Jar binks, Domhall Gleeson completely miscast as General Hux present to supremely ham it up with his drama student's imitation of Peter Cushing. If they wanted someone to play an imposing menacing baddie with some gravitas why not cast someone that actually resonates that such as Charles Dance, Mark Strong or countless other actors with a more mature menacing presence. He then goes on to engage in a competely inappropriate and ridiculous moment of ""humour"" with Poe which further undermines the sense of darkness that should be emanating from the first order.
The main plot is a dull drawn out escape which many people have pointed out the flaws with previously. Luke SkyWalker is completely underused, Jedi training now seems to have become completely superfluous as Rey gains amazing powers after one brief training session with Luke and Leia has suddenly gained the powers of superwoman. There is a sidequest to stop the tracking of the rebel fleet which could have been an interesting and dark exploration of an immoral materialistic arms producing culture but consists mainly of a dull brief trip round a casino. The whole idea of how the tracking has happened on the rebel fleet ships and who has done it ignored. Snook is dispatched with before we get any idea of who he is , where he came from and how he turned Kylo Ren to the dark side. It seems like whoever wrote the plot was more concerned about making student a level political platitiudes that money is bad, women are good, and men irresponsible, cowardly, or incompetent than coming up with a cogent strong plot that fitted in with the rest of the star wars lore.

"Well.. An arrogant way, ( very XXI Cent indeed in my humble view), to look at everything great done freshly in a past not that far far away.. With that sense of those responsible bluffing and bragging about how much bigger better, more visually spectacular things are going to look., almost saying.. well´.. that was alright, but I think OURS is more how it should be.. only to end up being an extremely ridiculous, absurd rip off, dumb flick, just like any other with any non-sensical title of those which over populate megaplexes these days..
This saga became gloriously iconic for several reasons, but I think, audiences were the main diference. Diferent world, diferent context.. STAR WARS ended with Return of the Jedi, with Lucas turning and giving in to the dark side himself, over a decade later. This cannot be ANY serious continuation to the original Star Wars. 
as time and decades went by, everyone realised what Star Wars meant.. 
KIds did not need back then the vast Disney array of fake little CGI pets, to force comic relief, or steal hearts for a second or two.. just to sell the silly thing to little kids, thats NOT the way it happened with Star Wars. We talk about spoilers these days a lot. Know! The biggest spoiler is for someone to ruin your imagination forever, be it prequel, sequel or remake..
Star Wars was not a formula, quite on the contrary it was the biggest risk, a tremendous visionary leap of faith, who truusted his inspiration and that world he created, to be told to younger and older people alike, and so it happened. Period
No need to cover the full spectrum, like Disney does today.. so miticulously detailed and crafted to try to please everyone yet I think ever failing to deliver anything intelligent, but rather throw brainless entertainment to exceedingly gullable audiences. The magic and spectacle, the awe at something lies in totally different places, and certailly deeper. Having said all that..
If you want to see Skywalker applying himself to a bottle of fresh out of the nipple blue milk of the dullest shapeless CGI creature ..those nuns in the island..,where he retires to.. What exactly?, listen to all those ludicrous lines of dialogue, pointless counless minutes wasted on some Casino like sequences, and pretentious pseudo morality, tale with Dickensian-like kids potentially filled with midichlorians being exploited by some baddies, and some Supergirlesque Leia flying her way into salvation, a poor R2 and C3PO given almost the last page and screen rites, while that Phasma runs around to do nothing, chrome gear and all, to be killed and reveal an eye under her mask before falling to her death..Hmm.. 
and some other assorted off the hook utter rubish current interpretation of brilliant old stories.. well go ahead. I wont mention SNOKE.. pseudo palpatine evil of evils.. the red ninja Kungfu fighting... please...RAY, being so proficient with the lightsaber, Why?? dUh,,, Does it matter anymore?..
I did. Benicio del Toro is the smartest and cool character..a wasted Lando..in this disposable, forgettable, enervating dramedy, its appeal mainly that its the longest of them all, which is a pleasure, would it serve a true, deep, honest purpose delivering magical moments.

"The only thing that made me want to see this film was Rian Johnson at the helm. His other films Looper, Brick, Brothers Bloom have all been excellent, and his episodes of Breaking Bad: ""The Fly"", ""Fifty-One"", and ""Ozymandias"", are examples of the best that show has to offer. 
After seeing the Force Awakens, I had realized what I hate about JJ Abrams' style of directing: 1. Everything is a puzzle, 2. Recycle any material for nostalgia, and 3. Emphasize plot, not characters. TFA was not a good movie, it was a bad movie. That'll piss off fanboys but it's true. TFA did nothing that wasn't predictable, rehashing A New Hope for a new generation, and failing at it. Only a few scenes in that film stand out. What Rian Johnson did was take the ending of TFA, throw out any stupid, superfluous puzzle boxes that Abrams left in, and actually sculpted chacacters that were not only believable, but likable. TLJ was the Star Wars film I desperately needed to see, one that i enjoyed, took a plot that in-universe took place over twelve or so hours, and used a lot of runtime to fix problems left by Abrams, and follow a lot of points through to their natural conclusion. What we're left with is the modern equivalent of Empire Strikes Back, a film that so many recognize as the best in the series, but so few really appreciate.

"aA long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, the powers that be decided it would make for good times to frankenstein a bunch of ambiguous scenes and mix in audiences' pre-existing emotional attachments for the sole purpose of generating Game of Thrones-like mystery to a universe that no longer needs any introduction. Fair enough. Everything about the Last Jedi trailer was open for interpretation and, naturally, fan theories went wild. I suppose the natural outcome of this could only have been disappointment but boy was I not ready. I should have listened to Luke when he foreshadowed: 'this is not going to go the way that you think.'
To say that this is the best Star Wars movie since Empire is a gross injustice to everything one holds dear as a fan. This movie is such a mish-mash of the unnecessary that it makes The Force Awakens (which I rather enjoyed) look like Citizen Goddamn Kane. As such, my review will be equally haphazard. Do I start by pointing out the badabing-badaboom comedic relief every thirty seconds or with Rey's suddenly cardboard-like demeanor? She had about as much enthusiasm and appreciation for her situation as I did at that point. Phasma: unnecessary, Benicio del Toro's weird stuttering bastardized version of Lando: unnecessary, Supreme Leader Snoke, as it turns out, unnecessary. Haven't we learned anything about slicing and dicing the dark side from episodes 1-3? Why not flesh out Snoke's character instead of using him as some sort of demonic matchmaker and then tossing him aside a la Darth Maul? Why toy with people by sort of killing Leia then hastily backtrackking? Did we really need that after what they did to Han? Same goes for Laura Dern's character. Is she good, is she bad, do I even care anymore? The answer is a resounding NO. Nice hair, though. 
The only new characters (per se) who, as far as I can tell, acted their asses off were Kylo Ren and Poe. Yes, I said Kylo Ren. Say what you will about his character but Adam Driver is busting ass to bring us a worthy portrayal of the inner conflict that was once at the core of the entire saga. The only criticism I have for him is solely based on the writing. At this point it seems as though Ren only has beef with the men in his life but maintains a soft spot when it comes to the ladies. That's all well and nice but this franchise has forever struggled with its depiction of evil and the problem shows no sign of yielding. His uncle tried to kill him and he's embittered. So far so good. But we get roughly one paragraph regarding the issue and what we're left with is a man who is still so angry about the experience, over a decade down the line, that he's practically frothing at the mouth and refuses to see any reason. That aside, it seems everyone has utterly given up on redemption. Ren isn't a teenager anymore and demonstrates on several occasions that he can discern right from wrong so his unbridled rage seems so over the top that by the end of it you're left thinking: you know what, just take a time out. Now who does that remind us of? Shoutout to grandpa!
Ren's bonding with Rey was playing out so well and they did a fine job of dangling moments of sexual tension in front of us, only to have that derailed at the end with a little moment shared by Poe and Rey. Really? Off-putting love triangle? You got us again!
Creature overload, character overload, obviously Finn finds a girlfriend more his speed since we couldn't possibly have the races mixing by putting Finn and Rey together (gasp!) because apparently no one's ready for that(?) Yoda puts in a nice little appearance as he and Luke bond over some more symbolism. A young slave boy earns a rebellion ring, assuring us that the Star Wars franchise will never end...My head hurts. In short, this movie was a mess and just makes me think that once episode 9 comes out, people will come to see 8 as a forgettable filler that poked and prodded at all our sore spots and left much to be desired.

Lucas Starwars had a better story and were a bigger fantasy with more amazing worlds and grandiose. These new movies feel like soup of the day with some old parts to give it Starwars flavor.Make no mistake the movies are enjoyable but not as memorable. They are starting to feel more like Marvel movies where action is more important than the plot.,0.3335664335664336,0.5272727272727272
"Let's start with this: what would you say if I told you that one of the main movies (not anthology) lacked a lightsaber fight? I enjoyed it until the moment that Leia was sucked into the vacuum of space, after an explosion of her ship. She then proceeded to USE THE FORCE TO FLOAT BACK TO HER SHIP!!! Come on, even for Star Wars that is outrageous. It had a boring subplot of Rose and Finn. It had a boring main plot of the resistance escaping the dreadnought. The scenes with Luke were quite good, but at the same time, they didn't feel like Star Wars, they felt like a psychedelic exploration of the soul. Snoke was a disappointment, not to mention that he looked awful. Finn vs Phasma, maybe the most anticipated part of the movie, based on the trailer, was an utter disappointment. 
The movie explored interesting concepts of leadership, sacrifice, morality, and death, yet these themes were muddled by horrid plot.
If I had watched this movie, having never seen Star Wars before, I would have loved it. But as of now, I cannot imagine a Star Wars movie (including Attack of the Clones) that I would dread seeing again more.",-0.04605263157894738,0.5864035087719298
"The reason why so many fans don't like or even hate this movie is because of the tremendous change of Luke's character. Personally, I don't mind this change and for me people have to accept that Ryan Johnson took a big risk by making a so, so, so unexpected film and I think it was worth it, and the change in Luke's character was worth it, because in reality people change and that's the case with Luke as well. Because it would've been easy to write a script in which Luke was the same person that we saw 40 years ago and at the end of which the good guys won and the bad ones lost and everything was perfect. But if that happened people would've said that it was too much like the originals, that there wasn't any changes at all and that Ryan Johnson wasn't creative enough to make a good movie. That happened with Force Awakens and people said that it's the same as A New Hope and that was probably one of the reasons why they decided to make The Last Jedi so different. So, what do we understand at the end? Well, the ones who hate TLJ probably like The Force Awakens more than The Last Jedi, but no one can deny that episode 8 is a better movie than 7. The only problem the fans have is that it doesn't give them what they expect to see and it doesn't satisfy their need to see Luke as the kid who experienced the walk into this much bigger universe along with us.",0.16796536796536793,0.5406385281385282

"Disney let a mad man make this movie and no I am not talking about george lucas. They are letting Rian Johnson write another new star wars trilogy movies why? This movie is really bad and I am a true star wars fan since I was seven. I loved the force awakens it had its problems no movie is perfect, but I thought it was good. Ok, let me begin with the review of this movie it started off great lots of action and some decent humor like the force awakens, then 20 minutes in this movie starts getting bad. Then movie slows to a crawl with Finn and a new character named rose they go to this casnio planet for some code breaking thing I am almost nodded off at that point. This movie had joke after joke after joke wedged in this movie none of the jokes worked and when it was suppose to be serious they inserted a stupid joke that fell flat! We finally get to meet luke of course he was this angry old man telling jokes never serious at all. There is a reason they didn't show much in the trailers, because you would of found out this was a comedy with bad jokes and no character development! Then old yoda makes an appearance gonna be serious right wrong old jokey yoda burns the jedi books and cave down to the ground funny right? The bad guy snoke menacing right kinda at first, then kylo turns rey's lightsaber which is sitting by snoke and ignites it and cuts the all mighty snoke in half! Are you kidding me kinda like killing darth maul in the phantom menace! Is rian really a fan of star wars or he is he pulling a andy kaufman putting a joke on us!

"I have never written a review before so felt inclinded to do so after reading all these negative reviews and shed some light on my opinion and not what's wrong with the movie but more so the audience. Warning I may have spoilers but I'll try to keep the movie a mystery as much as possible. The movie it's self was a fine piece of work and felt like Star Wars but of course I did have a few issues but I'll touch on that later. First I wanted to say I am sick of people being disappointed and giving this movie bad reviews simple because they did not get what they wanted (which in my opinion still wouldn't have been enough if they did.). People seemed to be left in confusion. Which is also a feeling the directors may have intended. Sometimes you leave a movie theater feeling different emotions.. happy , sad etc and confused is one of them. Let me give some examples, the entire mystery of Snoke and how people must know this mans origins story in the first 5 seconds of meeting him. The Audience is so impatient they must know everything about a character the moment they meet them. Which would ruin a movie cause it'd be 4 hours long going into background story's. Can't forget this is a movie and not everything will have been answered or it just becomes ridiculous. Also this is a Saga and more answers may be coming our way. I looked ahead at episode 9 and Snoke is still in the cast which means we may be getting more answers as to who he is and why Kylo went to him. Let's think back to previous episodes. Say the Emperor for example no one knew his origin story or how Darth Vader and the Emperor came to be till Lucus made those CGI awfulness in the early 2000's (episodes 1,2,3). Were people up in arms about not knowing enough about the Emeror? Maybe... but they didn't have social media back in the 70s so clowns weren't freaking out, who is this? Why that and why this? Just wait watch and find out. And yes unfortunately we do not really figure out who Rey's parents are yet but that still may be coming. Rey is told from a one sided point of view who they may be. Which means they could be anyone.. Now say they did tell us Rey's parents, people would have been freaking out saying OMG this was just like the empire strikes back luke finds out Darth his is papa. So really could the directors give people what they want. I don't think so, people will never be satisfied. Also let's give these directors and writers a break about making it similar to episodes 4, 5, 6. Im sure they are huge Star Wars fans or they wouldn't be involved and I imagine they feel some what influence by the movies they may have grown up with. So call me crazy but I can't blame them for following a kind of guide line and making it similar. I'm just saying when they made another star destroyer in the force awakens people were pissed but what other kind of super weapon would you create in a lightspeed traveling univierse? Some toxic gas we'll shoot at your planet or we will unleash our super weapon which does what? They want to create a weapon of urgency, a massive laser that will blow you up in a blink of an eye can't really top that...",0.0423955296404276,0.5337382572076449

"Like many, I went into this film full of hope with a completely open mind, and wanted to like it! It started well, a bit of forced humour in places, but still enjoyable. The middle of the film seemed quite pointless in parts like the Canto Bait scenes, but I loved Snoke's throne room scenes and he came across as a really good villain, really driving Kylo and Rey against eachother and manipulating them nicely. When Rey is brought before him I could not wait to see how everything was going to play out. But then he died very easily, and rather pathetically in the end, and then so did Phasma, and then Luke seemed to go out on an anti-climax as well after a great build up in the ending sequence.

"I will start off by saying that The Last Jedi is not perfect, not perfect at all. This does not mean it isn't a bad movie, this is a very good movie and a different take on the Star Wars universe. It is filled with many twists, great action, and superb visuals. Like I said before it has flaws, the tone is a bit all over the place and there are a couple questionable scenes, but this does not make it bad! This is a very good movie and I left the theater very satisfied. Something that makes me laugh is that people are complaining that this movie is different and doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie, there are times that this is true, but when Force Awakens came out the same people were complaining it wasn't different and how it was just like a New Hope. That part makes me laugh and makes me think people will always complain and can never be pleased when it comes to movies.

Characters who were set to have a prominent role and develop in the film such as Snoke and Phasma were killed off without explanation of their previous roles which should've been important to the film.

Worst parts:
Leia as Mary Poppins in space. 
A low-speed OJ Simpson space chase as the fleet allows their ships to gradually be picked off without doing anything.
Out of character Yoda ghost scene with him torching the last Jedi library.
The CGI of Snoke walking in throne scene seemed like a 1990's effort.
They killed off the most powerful villain half-way through the middle film in a 3-part series just after we got to know him.
Too many characters. Lots of different rebels who have a fair few lines but its not really clear why they are important. 
Luke Skywalker character was ruined. I know Mark Hamill is not happy about that, and I suspect a lot of long-time fans aren't either.
Uncomfortable desperate final act of a last stand Western wasn't the right feeling for a Star Wars movie.

"It's about conflict and balance. That's what the whole of the Star Wars saga has been about. Luke and Snoke are at opposite ends of the Force spectrum and both meet their ends in this film. Dealing with internal conflict over which side to choose, Kylo kills his master after deciding to save the life of a person he clearly has connection with. Sounds similar to how Vader betrays the Emperor doesn't it? Luke exiles himself on a remote planet after seeing himself as having failed the Jedi order, which parallels Yoda's journey between episodes 3 and 4. Having turned his back on the Force, he continues with his struggle to find his position. Why retreat to an ancient Jedi island if you're through with the religion? He decides to burn the Jedi texts before changing his mind, even trying to rush in an rescue them once Yoda makes the decision for him. His words and actions contradict one another until he finally re-embraces the Force, provides a distraction for the beleaguered Resistance and finds redemption by sacrificing himself to save the day. Again, his arc mirrors that of both his father and his first master, Obi Wan.
 
In this film we see more than in TFA that Kylo and Rey are different sides of the same coin. Their hostility carries through from TFA until Rey senses good within Kylo during their Force chats and allows herself to be cuffed and taken into custody, just as Luke did in RotJ. The light within Kylo seems to win through as they work together to defeat Snoke's guards. They have the same goal - the end to the war - but chose different paths to get there, and, after realising this difference, are at odds again. It's worth noting that Kylo offers Rey the opportunity to rule alongside him, just as Vader did to Luke, and Anakin did to Padme.
 
I understand the grievances about the storyline and the character arcs but look at the message and themes of the film and how it ties into the saga as a whole. We often hear about balance in the Force but, for me, in TLJ, it's the first time we see signs of it.

"I'm confused on what I just saw. It's taken me a few days to write this review because I've gone back and forth with reviewing a Star Wars film badly, but it needs to be done. ""The Last Jedi"" was by far the worst ""Star Wars"" film I have ever seen, if it can even be called that. I'll start with the beginning of the film. It began much like many Star Wars movies do, a big grand space battle. My expectations were high and this beautifully filmed battle met those expectations.... until the most cringeworthy comedy I've ever seen. This began the downfall of this movie. Poe decides to have silly banter with General Hux (our big bad Tarkin like figure) and it comes off ridiculous. The joke brought laughs, but it had absolutely no place within the Star Wars universe. Never would Tarkin have been made fun of in such a way. Why now is the First Order used as a punching bag for terrible jokes? Shouldn't they be even more feared than the Galactic Empire? This scene was terrible, but it was hopefully just a one off right? Nope. So the resistance ships proceed to jump to hyperspace and evade their enemies only to....not evade their enemies? When could a ship ever track something from hyperspace? This part is fine though as in Rouge One this detail is actually said to be in development by the galactic empire so okay, this works, but what follows next does not. The First Order ships (and there's many) are not able to destroy the Resistance Ships because of the shields. And so begins the slowest chase in a movie. The First Order ships obviously could have moved faster to make the Resistance ships lose fuel faster but this is not done. Kylo Ren along with other pilots fly into battle in an effort for Kylo to prove his evil to Supreme Leader Snoke and murder his own mother. This doesn't happen and what happens next is inexcusable. A First Order pilot is the one that pulls the trigger to blow up the Command room of the Resistance Ship housing fan favorites Admiral Ackbar and General Leia Organa. This seems perfectly done. It shows Kylo is still heavily conflicted while also dealing with Carrie Fisher's untimely demise in a near perfect fashion story-telling wise and dispatching Ackbar. The audience then sees Leia's body floating in space and it is a haunting scene that carries emotional weight....until she moves. As a viewer, I was so confused. I prayed they weren't about to do what I thought they might. Then Rian Johnson proved me so wrong. Leia literally uses the Force to pull herself into the ship in the worst scene I've ever seen. This coming after she should have been blown to pieces by a massive explosion and then blown up due to being in the middle of space. They wasted this perfect opportunity to dispatch Leia and lost all emotional weight as the audience went ""Oh well Um I guess she's alive?"". It was ridiculous. We then go to the island planet that we last see Rey at during the ending scene of the Force Awakens and at this point an already sour taste is in most of the audiences mouth who is a Star Wars fan. Rey hands Luke the lightsaber and he then throws it behind him in a clear comedic fashion yet again. Sadly the comedy gets even worse. We then see Luke as he spears for fish, drinks green milk directly from the teets of an alien, and walks up and down a mountain. Sounds as good as Yoda at Dagaboh huh? After this, Luke finally talks to Rey. Mark Hamill performed amazing here with his terrible lines given to him, but he did not feel like the Luke of old. It isn't even a matter of ""Oh well Luke can change, he's years older"", this felt like a different character entirely. That's the problem. Not a change, but a powerful deviation. I've seen many reviews that say it's only fans that didn't like it and that's actually accurate, it's fans because the characters lost their true emotion and the trueness that made them so memorable in the beginning. Rian Johnson lost this completely. He lost the feel of Star Wars. Rey and Kylo establish an interesting dynamic with them being able to form a connection with the Force and this is actually interesting and a cool take on the whole Force communication. This connection provides Rey with the idea that Kylo still has the old Ben Solo still within him, but Luke sees this and freaks out. The audience then comes to find out the true story of Luke and Kylo. Luke thought about murdering Kylo and actually pulled a lightsaber on him while he slept only to decide against giving the killing blow. This is more of the same, Luke not acting like Luke. This is supposed to be the main reason that Kylo turns evil, but this shouldn't have even happened. Luke fought to save his father because he sensed he had a little good left within him, but one hint of darkness in his own Nephew is where he draws the line? Give me a break. After this scene and the island, the movie goes back to the First Order and Resistance in their slow chase. Vice Admiral Holdo is now in charge and is clearly the foil to Poe and acts as if there is not a plan and they are only giving up (this becomes important later). Poe disagrees and contacts Maz (who is in this movie for almost no reason) who says they must go get a Master Codebreaker so that a plan thought out by Finn and a random mechanic named Rose can happen. Finn and Rose must now travel to Canto Bight to find this codebreaker. Much like a video game, this is a pointless side quest to get to the main quest of boarding the First Order ships and turning their tracker off. This whole side story bogged down everything. The planet of Canto Bight possesses no emotion. It seems to only be there as a social commentary on war. That isn't what audiences come to see. They come to be taken away by a sprawling world. Suffice it to say, the whole scene ends with them finding a codebreaker, but not the one that they originally came for. They then escape Canto Bight on big horse aliens with the help of stable children. This whole thing takes about 20 minutes and it it 20 minutes too long. Rey has now decided to go find Kylo and talk him into joining the light. She is captured by his ship and taken directly to the Supreme Leader. This scene is the best of the entire movie as Supreme Leader Snoke possesses that same awe that came with seeing the Emperor for the first time in Return of the Jedi. He was powerful and evil and so well done.....then he died. Like that. 10 minutes and he was sliced in half by a lightsaber that was not even wielded, but turned on a chair by Kylo Ren with the Force. The big bad was now gone and had gone out in an even more embarrassing way than the fan favorite Darth Maul. At least Darth Maul fought two Jedi in being bested, Snoke sat in his chair and died. Snokes guards then attack Kylo and Rey in a very cool scene, but the power of this scene was overshadowed by what had just occurred with Snoke. It seemed as if Rian Johnson had no interest in revealing Snokes backstory or keeping him around. The movie then does the same disservice to Captain Phasma and it seems like a cop out. The movie then reveals that Holdo had a plan to move all the Resistance members aboard shuttles to fly down to Crait. Why wouldn't she have just told Poe this and avoided the whole Finn/ Rose quest and avoid a mutiny on the ship. It was a time filler and it was just dumb. It makes no sense. Finally, everyone is now down on Crait. The First Order and Resistance are doing battle again....for..the..third..time. It feels so overused because the audience has seen the same battle now three times in the same film. First order has a big cannon, The Resistance has to take it out. Sound familiar? The planet of Crait is beautiful and unique, but we only see a little bit of it as battle starts. The First Order is winning the battle easily until Luke Skywalker shows up. He comes out and faces the First Order and Kylo tells the First Order to fire every piece of artillery at Luke. Luke is left unscathed and Kylo then comes down to meet him in battle. This is another beautifully filmed scene, but it is found that Luke is just Force projecting himself there as he sits atop his rock at his island home. This seems like just a gotcha moment from the director, but makes no sense. Why wouldn't Luke actually battle Kylo? Even if Kylo won, it would make him seem very powerful and dangerous. Instead Kylo fits a projection and the fight feels lame. Luke then dies. From nothing really it seems. They kill off the best Star Wars hero not in a battle, but on a rock by himself. It could not have been a worse way to send Luke out. The Resistance then escapes by the Millennium Falcon flown by Rey and the movie feels over until one last scene of a stableboy making a broom fly into his hand due to the force and staring into the night sky. Boom. Movie over. This was not a Star Wars film. This was a good scfi film, but not a good Star Wars film. It lacked heart, it lacked emotion, and most of all it lacked common sense. It was filled with terrible comedy, stupid plot holes, and an underwhelming sequence of events.

"This film presents an audience with a glorious visual spectacle, exciting plot twists and adventure, and better dialog than some previous installments of the Star Wars franchise. As a science fiction action adventure film, if it were not posing as a film in the Star Wars universe, it would deserve a high rating of 7 or 8. However, as a Star Wars film, it presents an insulting betrayal of the audience by asking them to believe that Luke Skywalker, a Jedi Master has, after years of meditative exile, devolved into a petulant adolescent, an egotistical dissembler, and a person lacking in wisdom and moral insight. The scriptwriters and director did not need to do this, as most of the conflict and tension necessary to the plot involving Luke's reluctance to train Rey or get involved in galactic politics could have been maintained while portraying Luke as a wise and honest Jedi with wisdom and empathy. The director and scriptwriters have stated that they thought the character Luke Skywalker had already achieved his role in the Return of the Jedi film, evidently unaware of the scores of novels and comic books covering decades of Galactic history following the Battle of Yavin. This Expanded Universe material (now ""legendary Star Wars"") proved that the Luke Skywalker character could be used again and again, and show character development and growth over a lifetime of adventure, but this film shows the lack of imagination and petty egotism of its creators who could think of nothing significant or respectful to do with this central character of the Star Wars universe. The lack of integrity in the Luke Skywalker character (he was so out of character in this film), and the betrayal of character coherence and the nearly total rejection of the deeper backstory to the Star Wars saga was so insulting, egregious, and unnecessary that as a Star Wars film this movie deserves only two stars. And so, on balance as an ""8"" as a generic action adventure science fiction film and a ""2"" as a Star Wars film, I give the movie 5 stars.",0.10073333333333334,0.5732666666666667

"I really wanted to love this movie, but left the theatre completely disappointed. I had mixed views on TFA, and was excited to see a new directors take on the Star Wars universe. Maybe I'm just too old now for Star Wars, and my love of the original trilogy is nostalgia. I thought there were too many weird character choices, strange and unnecessary plot points, and the general feeling that this trilogy is not taking us anywhere new. A group of good people (rebellion/resistance) must fight against an evil (empire/new order) to create a good new republic. We already saw this happen, didn't we? Maybe build off the original trilogy and tell a new story. If you're going to tell a similar story again, at least make it good! I understand that they want to take the series in a new direction, but why not do that with the next trilogy? This is the conclusion of the Skywalker storyline, so it's OK for it to feel like the first movies, then you move into the new trilogy in the same universe, with a new feel and new characters (maybe with some cameos), etc..

Let's just say I really love Rey's character, Kylo also grows into his role (I know many disagree with me on this one). Well that's about it, what's good about the movie. 
 The biggest disaster aside from the plot (plot?) was the use of hyperjump as a weapon. If Starwars physics works this way there would have been countless adaptations of throwing mass into faster than light speeds.

While waiting for this episode 8, I had the great pleasure of watching Rogue One which is a masterpiece when it comes to respect what I would call the Star Wars spirit. Watching Rogue One, I felt home. Everything was just pure pleasure and fun. I have watched hundred times the original trilogy, the prequel and episode 7 waiting for this episode 8. And now I have finally been to the last Jedi. It would be exaggerated if I would say that this movie is bad. It is entertaining and full of good moments and fun. I loved Poe and the first space battle introducing the movie, I loved Kylo Ren and BB8 is just so cool. But the Star Wars fan in me is heartbroken. At the end of Episode 6 I imagined that Luke would have had a great life and is a great hero. What I discovered in episode 8 was not easy to understand. How could the guy who believes in the light inside bad people, inside Vader, try to kill his nephew? How could Snoke the guy who smashes people on the ground in another ships (just with his mind) not notice a lightsaber turning in his right? Where are the knights of Ren? Princess Leia flying in space? Seriously? I agree that Rian Johnson has all the freedom to make a movie in his way. I understand that sometimes it has to be different, we have to be surprised and things have to be disruptive to create something new and exciting.

"Star Wars appears to have become a vehicle for a forced agenda and not about great story telling. The Last Jedi was horribly filmed, the transitions between scenes and the attempts at forced humor and light heartedness are akin more to a sitcom. The endless parade of characters that don't matter appears to be agenda driven. This film is 2 1/2 hours long yet every scene appears rushed because they force too much in. How they treated the character of Luke Skywalker was horrible and I have to agree with Mark Hamill's comments entirely - its like they re-wrote his character.. Just poor choices. People are too happy in this movie in the face of loss and struggle and it just feels like everyone is doing the motions to create the film so Disney can sell a lot of cheap plastic toys. Just very very sad, I was so very disappointed. The villains inspired zero fear and were so subdued - no way Kylo-Ren or Snoke could survive in the constant battle for power the Empire is known for, not based on what we saw. This movie just seemed cheap and the forced addition of characters seems more about Disney wanting the franchise to appeal to a larger market. The character of Rose -- I felt like she was acting in another movie, it felt like she was completely disconnected from what was going on and the film she was in... She just sucked big time, her lines were child like and simple, her character had no real depth and they have to stop filling the Star Wars universe with animated characters like Maz Kanata they are tacky to say the least. The emotion in this film was not there and the focus was lacking.

"I enjoyed the last Star Wars. If I remember correctly much of the action took place on the ground away from the space ships. With this episode so much of the film is set in the ships -- and accompanied with endless poorly executed CGI explosions. It just went on and on -- even cutting away from turgid meaningful conversations to show more rocket guns or whatever you call them missing their mark or bouncing off protective invisible shields. To be honest I tired of the film about a third of the way in. The two and a half hours dragged terribly. A yawn fest of yet more explosions or battle scenes that simply made no logical sense with some mighty bombers easily blown to smithereens while lots of fighters zoomed about like demented flies. And then there was poor old Luke Skywalker living in a stone hut on the edge of a cliff with some girl parked outside his door waiting for him to pop out for a spot of sea fishing so she could try to tempt him back to save the day. Boring..... And when old Luke throws a hissy fit and ignores her whining she engages in deep conversation with a bloke who is not even there. He dresses in black and sports a nice line in heroic scars. Go knows where he actually is -- but he ain't next to her that's for sure even though they stare meaningfully into each other's troubled eyes. Carrie Fisher sits down for most of the film, but does see it through to the end -- and then she's gone...... Look, any film that begins with Ade Edmondson dressed up like a pseudo Nazi having a rant with a wild-eyed carrot-topped geezer who comes from the let's-all--go-over-the-top school of acting is on a hiding to nothing.

"Honestly, it was entertaining, but some of the questions The Force Awakens leaves us hanging with is a serous concern.",0.55,0.8
"There are some good things. There are some cool visuals, most of the acting is decent, and there are two or three interesting scenes.",0.36944444444444446,0.4861111111111111
The internet is an angry place and it is a shame that rather than helpful and truthful reviews we are left with subjective bile. I want to place an honest review and I do not have my own agenda. ,0.24,0.6799999999999999
"I think that the movie could be a lot better if there hadn't been these weird monsters like Chewbacca, Casino members etc. (They could be humans)...... It would not be so boring & annoying if it had not all the time, the same and the same sound effects, agony, sad or hope music, too! At least, they would be great to are a little new-times remixed..... !!!",-0.17192826704545452,0.6090909090909091

"Frankly, this movie made me feel good. Yes, there were new ""force-rules"" introduced that didn't make a lot of sense for the Star Wars lineage. Yes, Rose's character was unnecessary. Yes, the casino scene was useless. However...it made me feel nostalgic and overall made me feel good! I laughed, I smiled, I felt a connection with some of the characters... what more can I want?",0.2464876033057851,0.509504132231405
"I gave this movie a 4/10 and the reason for that was because of how slow and confusing the movie was. It was a horrible decision to change the directors because all of the amazing work J.J. Abrams did in Episode 7, developing great characters and future plot like when Rey handed Luke the light saber, is immediately/literally thrown out. Rian Johnson turned Hux into a buffoon, Poe becomes a ""hot shot"" making his own decisions which was never shown in the last movie and also destroyed the bromance between Poe and Finn, added Rose who ends up having a poor ""romantic"" relationship with Finn (The bromance was wayyy better), also Phasma could've been a badass in this episode, but ends up dying within like 7 mins of being on screen, then we really don't get much to look at about Snoke except him getting cut in half, and last a sloooowww chase, keep chasing the rebels until their shuttles run out of fuel! Rian Johnson did a horrible job at this. Now some of the good parts of the movie which kept me from doing 1/10 was the battle on Crait, Luke being badass at the end (he definitely improved at acting since the first star wars movie), and when Rey and Kylo fight Snokes guards. The comedy was ok, some parts were great and some were just, meh. I really don't know where to put this if we did a list of the best star wars movies since the beginning was meh, and end was awesome. In the end this movie had some amazing parts but mostly was not really enjoyable, at the end of the movie I was very confused because afterall it was a star wars movie so I MUST like it, but really didn't.

"It's unbelievable to read the bile and hatred spat on this film. I've seen it three times now and it definitely gets better with each viewing, unlike the prequels which make the facepalms deeper with repeats. I can tell why people react the way they did, no one expected this jarring of a shock to an episode for Star Wars, of which fans had already complained on the last episode that it mimicked A New Hope. We get a new, exciting vision of the universe that's still grounded in what makes it so great and fun, and people lose their minds. This has always been a space opera paying homage to classic sci fi serials and it delivers on that front. It's a Star Wars film and a damn good one even if it wasn't called Star Wars. I feel that with a few years time it will be revered for the awesome episode that it was. (Yes Leia Poppins looked stupid, but everything else looks so slick, well shot and thought out that it can be overlooked.) Great job Johnson, can't wait to see what else you come up with for the new trilogy.",0.16188197767145135,0.5143141945773525
"This movie was absolutely amazing, I was constantly thrilled in the mystery of each character. Rian really displayed the true feelings of Kylo REN and Rey. They weren't sure about what they thought life was but they knew they would help each other through the hardships.",0.3541666666666667,0.6189814814814815
Short - a very disjointed plot that fails to get your attention.,-0.09999999999999999,0.3
"Wow. Has anyone seen Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, or Harry Potter? They're also movies with some plot faults, suspension of disbelief, and believe it or not... cheesy production values. This one was pretty smart and pretty fun. Definitely fun to watch ( battle of the red room, Luke being totally badass on a salt planet, yoda being silly). 
Proud to add it as another notch in a cinematic universe I've had the pleasure of viewing in its original release theatrically. That's right, I'm bragging that I've seen every Star Wars movie upon its original release. I'm old...",0.13823529411764707,0.5943277310924371
I'm a huge Starwars fan. I have seen alle movies at least muliple times. But I just couldnt get into The Last Jedi. The humor was so cringeworthy and some of the story borring. What's up with the spacehorses? Why was the main storyline revolving around a non existant chase so confussing? Why was Luke not like Luke at all? I yearn back to the days of Ewoks. At least that made sense.,-0.005555555555555545,0.35000000000000003
"I love how the main music theme is based upon the sounds of the French horn which can be haunting at times and other times very full with the sounds of the other lower instruments weaving in and out ending in a strong bass line. The upper line quietly flows over the powerful bass line until it takes on the theme and weaves in sounds that engage the listeners emotions. The heart beat flows through the timpani and middle instruments creating the excitement and tension. The quiet sections evoke the sense of peace, love and foreboding all at the same time. Overall, I was not disappointed by the sounds created by the master...John Williams. 
This latest installment was every bit as good as the original where we are introduced by the power of the force. May the light and hope shine through to provide the new beginning we all hope for in which we are surrounded by love and friends. 
Well done...",0.19964015151515155,0.4699116161616161
"Episode 8 was a very interesting movie. It was a great movie, if you are not looking t it as a star wars fan. However as a star wars fan, I was disappointed. ",0.2333333333333334,0.7166666666666667
"No spoilers, but If you haven't seen The Last Jedi stop reading now. It's been out long enough if you haven't watched it you're probably not a huge star wars fan anyway. Here's my brief rant about the film. Katherine Kennedy (Lucas Film President) along with her Co-defendant Director Rian Johnson have destroyed the Star Wars Film Franchise. I'm not alone with this assessment. Literally on wikipedia if you search Katherine Kennedy it says - ""Kathleen Kennedy is an American film producer and is the reason for the downfall of the most beloved film franchise, Star Wars."" I won't go into the individual reasons why the movie is so ridiculous, because my review would be as long as the movie. When you look at the complete devastation this movie has done to the franchise (on a likability scale) it will rank just a little higher than the Phantom Menace for future generations. But honestly the even the Phantom Menace did a better job on character development and plot. Disney had a lot riding on the new era of Star Wars and I think they've tarnished their brand a bit with they way they've handled this. With his original trilogy, George Lucas created something unlike the world had ever seen to that point. Star Wars was special and left a lasting mark on popular culture and fans like me. Star Wars will carry on from here, but only in name and not in spirit.",0.09990692640692642,0.5200389610389611
"I'd describe The Last Jedi as a bad good movie. On the base level, I feel like it could be a breath of new life in the franchise that could save it from becoming another stale and repetitive entry. However, if you look into the film and its story, it starts to show some major holes that create an inconsistent and incoherent film. Don't get me wrong, The Last Jedi is no Episode 2. There are some redeeming and good parts of this film, some of the most interesting and unique concepts we've seen from a galaxy far far away.",0.061782296650717716,0.5853269537480065
"The Last Jedi is a little frustrating to watch from the standpoint of Star Wars fandom. It is far better viewing experience than the majority of the prequel films. I felt that when The Last Jedi was good that it was incredibly good, but the same could be said for it's less appealing moments. That when bad it is really frustratingly bad. I can only assume that a lot of this comes from studio interference.",0.02470238095238097,0.518452380952381
