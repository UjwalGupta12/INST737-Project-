"And now, the Darth Vader origin story really begins. In fact, ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" sort of renders its predecessor useless. ""Episode I"" feels like a mostly unnecessary part of the story now that ""Episode II"" gives a better glimpse into the troubled young man Anakin Skywalker – the future Darth Vader – has become.

"Much like its predecessor, Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones has gained a rather sour reputation on the internet.

"I found most of the film to be boring, the interactions between Pádme and Anakin feel very weird and unconfortable, the cgI looks really bad in this one and the mistery that Obi Wan tries to solve is uninteresting. More than half of the movie is boring because of this problems but they are solved in the third act, which happends to be actually interesting and exciting. Also I actually liked the politics in this movie, you can understand them more easily and they actually have really strong consequences. Still, not the worst Star Wars movie.",-0.05833333333333332,0.5916666666666666

"This episode of the Star wars saga was criticized by some when it came out for having wooden dialogue and too much digital landscaping to be any good.

"It seems as though there is no way to dispel negative atmosphere once it has been started. George Lucas's STAR WARS trilogy was well-loved by audiences (even though critics were split) but for some reason (and I can't figure it out), the first entry in the prequels, THE PHANTOM MENACE, earned a HUGE onslaught of critically divided posts just about everywhere in the world, from the press to the internet to fans in real life. While I do agree that the original trilogy is a tough act to follow, I wasn't as grossly let down by this movie as some were.",0.04228395061728396,0.5117283950617284

"I do agree that this is the weakest of the six Star Wars movies, but it wasn't by all means a terrible movie. I will admit the dialogue is weak and gets nowhere at times, the plot isn't as well thought out and felt convoluted at best, Haydn Christensen does give a truly abysmal performance as Anakin and although the presence of Jar Jar Binks was toned down here his presence anywhere seemed jarring. Still despite the major flaws, it is a marvel to look at with stunning sets and impeccable CGI. The battle sequences are well choreographed, the pace is somewhat brisker than in Phantom Menace and the performances with the exception of Christensen are very good.",0.21149305555555553,0.6554861111111111
"I happen to be one of the folks who really has enjoyed these films in the prequel trilogy.  I also can see why people would not like the films and I don't deny people the right to their opinion.  What has been bothering me has been some of the reasons people are giving for hating these new films... they are childish, they have too many special-effects, the acting is bad, the writing is bad, Lucas has sold out and has lost his touch... it makes me wonder if people are actually remembering the original trilogy correctly. Don't get me wrong, I love the original trilogy, but they weren't exactly well-acted or well-written movies.  We didn't love them because they were these great Shakespearian works of art; we loved them because we were little kids totally enraptured by this exciting fantastical world.  It seems that those same kids that loved the films 20 years ago have grown up into stuffy old yuppies that have no idea how to have fun anymore.  Our generation has grown up and it seems that we wanted Star Wars to grow up with us, to morph into some new R-rated grown up version to satisfy our more mature needs. Well, we didn't like the original trilogy because it was all grown up and serious.  We liked it because it was silly and fun and awesome to look at. I am personally glad that George Lucas did not make the prequels into a new grown up version.  I like the adventure and excitement and I challenge the one major complaint that says that they do not live up to the originals. Let's look at what people have complained about when comparing these to the original trilogy.",0.16629975715341572,0.5451061133987962
"*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* If you remember, I was one of the few who did not hate The Phantom Menace, in fact, I gave it a positive rating. If you'd like to get a different opinion on the prequels, please be sure and check that review out as well, but now, let's talk about The Attack of The Clones. This movie has a few rough spots, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman don't have very good chemistry together, despite both of them giving decent performances in the rest of the movie. No, Hayden Christensen isn't that bad, he's a bit wooden, but I think he plays a believable confused young man who has been isolated all his life. In fact, I think that most of the hate surrounding Christensen is less about how he plays his role, and more about what role he's playing. People don't want Vader to be a bitter and over- reacting teenager, but in the scenes where Christensen is able to show who he'll become, he's great. Besides, this is all about how Anakin becomes Vader, he can't start out as Vader in Episode II. The movie also gets heat for other stuff, too boring, too much CGI, etc. The CGI effects look great, it makes it look like a more advanced culture, by having surroundings that we can't yet physically create. Now, maybe a few practical effects wouldn't have been amiss, but I think the use of CGI is a relatively minor complaint, and one that doesn't really effect the over-all quality of the film. The plot may be slow at times, but don't forget, we have lots of action in here as well. A full scale battle at the end, a high speed chase through Courscant, a duel between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, etc. Yes there are slow stretches, but there are also plenty of scenes that are really fun. I know Yoda fighting with a light-saber, you know, a Jedi's weapon, is supposed to be just like heresy or something, but I can't take that complaint seriously. How else would Yoda have fought? With a stick? It's not like he doesn't use the force or anything! But enough with the negatives, let's talk about why this movie is genuinely good. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan is great! He brings the right level of sophistication and intelligence to the character, while still managing to seem like a less experienced version of the character in A New Hope. Jango Fett is a really good villain, he brings in great action and is just over all a really cool character. I already said I like Hayden Christensen, who I think accurately displays youth, and provides a relate-able character for everyone who's ever been a teenager ever. The action is top-notch as well. The speeder chase on Courscant is a great start to the movie; humor, good effects, and very fast-paced. The finale is very well done also, and it's a blast to see the first full scale battle in a Star Wars movie (the gungans don't count). The story, thought admittedly a bit muddled, is interesting enough (let's be honest, Star Wars isn't story based, it is driven by characters and action). I understand very few will agree with this review, but I wanted to give my own opinion on the Star Wars movies, so, I started reviewing them. I'll try to have my Revenge of the Sith review up soon!",0.1947123835760199,0.48511303511303505

"Ten years after the invasion of Naboo, the Galactic Republic is facing a Separatist movement and the former queen and now Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) travels to Coruscant to vote on a project to create an army to help the Jedi to protect the Republic. On the arrival, she escapes from an attempt to kill her and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are assigned to protect her. They chase the shape-shifter Zam Wessell (Leeanna Walsman) but she is killed by a poisoned dart before revealing the identity of who hired her. The Jedi Council assigns Obi-Wan Kenobi to discover the bounty hunter that has tried to kill Amidala and Anakin to protect her in Naboo. Obi-Wan discovers that the dart is from the planet Karmino and he heads to the remote planet. He finds an army of clones that has been under production for years for the Republic and that the bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) was the matrix for the clones. Meanwhile Anakin and Amidala fall in love with each other and he has nightmares with his mother. They travel to his planet Tattoine to see his mother and he discovers that she has been abducted by the evil Tusken Raiders. Anakin finds his mother dying and he kills all the Tusken tribe including the women. Obi-Wan follows Jango Fett to the planet Geonosis where he finds who is behind the Separatist movement. He transmit his discoveries to Anakin since he cannot reach the Jedi Council. Who is the leader of the Separatist movement? Will Anakin receive Obi-Wan's message? And the secret love between Anakin and Amidala will succeed?",-0.12250000000000001,0.4175
"First off the movie had some good aspects about it. For one the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin was phenomenal. They were emotional and comedic at the same time. The second thing is the action. This movie was very action packed and the choreography in the fights were very good. The conflict was nice as well I just wish they didn't have as many sub-plots. I didn't like how unnecessarily long this movie was, it felt like 3 hours. Some scenes didn't need to be included and I didn't like how they made it seem as if Anakin was obsessed over Padme but other than that their romance was believable and cute. The acting was strong although sometimes it came off as bland. The beginning tried to be serious but ended up looking like a joke. The movie was pretty good overall but could've done better.",0.2249305555555556,0.5136111111111111

"The second episode of the new trilogy of ""Star Wars"" was much better than the first. He is much more gloomy, eventful and full of the sense that soon the customary world will collapse ... Moreover, it can be considered the most romantic film of the saga - speech, of course, about the love line of Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala performed by Natalie Portman. It is not only very well developed, but it also takes place mainly in very beautiful, blooming locations, which is generally uncommon for Star Wars. Even sad to realize that it is waiting for a tragic ending ...",0.2241477272727273,0.5804924242424242

"Say what you will about George Lucas, you have to give the guy credit for setting himself a difficult task in `Star Wars: Attack of the Clones' (and I do mean beyond trying to deliver a film that will meet the almost impossibly high expectations of his millions of fanatical followers).   By choosing to place Anakin Skywalker front and center as the story's main focal point, Lucas does what few others in this business are willing to do  which is to risk making a crowd-pleasing epic without a likable central `hero.'  After all, since this film is a prequel and not a sequel to the original trilogy, we all know that this brooding young man will end up turning into the irredeemably evil Darth Vader.  Of course, Luke Skywalker fulfilled the requirements of conventional hero for the original series and even Han Solo, though he was a bit of a rogue and a scoundrel, always allowed his virtuous side to break through when the chips were down.  Anakin, though, for all his internal struggles in this film, is predestined to go over to the Dark Side (certainly in the next installment).  The pre-knowledge the audience is privy to from our acquaintance with the later chapters gives the film a kind of poignant sadness at times - or at least it would if Lucas had done a better job as both writer and director in bringing it out.  Unfortunately, the dialogue is so poorly written that Anakin comes across as little more than a petulant, peevish, moony-eyed schoolboy most of the time  hardly either the `greatest Jedi knight' we keep being told he has the potential to become nor the future Hitlerian dictator we know he will one day be.   His romantic, puppy-love interludes with Senator (former Queen) Padme Amidala are embarrassing at best.

"What was it that set Darth Vader off to join the dark side of the force?

"""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" was one of the most colossally disappointing films I've ever seen in my life. Now comes the second installment in George Lucas's prequel trilogy to the epic narrative that broke box office records and set standards for generations to come. The second movie detailing the past of Darth Vader, ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" is a little bit better, but that's not quite enough to make it a recommendable movie. It's close, but not quite. If it only they had thrown out Jar-Jar Binks (yes, I still cringe every time I think of that bumbling, frog-like freak), patched up some mediocre dialogue, reworked this sappy love story, and captured a better sense of the magic that we require for a Star Wars movie, it would have worked.",0.07589285714285714,0.5321428571428571

Now that I'm older, I respect them for what they are: incredibly creative, exciting and touching films. I have yet to see Episode 1. My friend recommended Episode 2 to me, telling me that it was better than its predecessor, but warning me ""don't see it if you expect anything more than a Star Wars movie."" Maybe I just have a nostalgic love for the first trilogy, but I would never think that they were anywhere near as poor, in any way, as this new garbage. I can't think of a high budget movie that I've seen that has such bad directing, bad acting, bad casting, bad special effects (or lack thereof), bad music, bad dialogue and bad plot, as ATTACK OF THE CLONES (bad title too).  The reviewers on this site giving this movie positive reviews must all be brainwashed. Maybe they're all just excited that it's better than Episode One, which I can only assume must be the worst movie ever made, considering this one definitely belongs in the bottom 100.",-0.039257455507455456,0.5953571428571428
"Attach of the clones is a very underrated Star Wars movie yes it's not perfect but is it as bad as lots of people say it is no its not. There is a lot of problems with this movie but there is some good things to. There is some great performances in this movie by most of the cast like Ewan mcgregor who gives the best performance in this movie. The villain count doku is great but there is also problems with him. The lightsaber fights are well shot and well made. The music is also great once again by John Williams. But theIr is a lot problems with attack of the clones. The story is all over the place and there is not really a set story with this movie. The villain count doku is a very great villain but the problem with him is he's barley in the movie he doesn't show up until an hour into the film and when he does show up there really isn't no threat of danger or anything by him until he captures Obi wan. The dialog in this movie is very sloppy and just bad from the infamous lines about sand and how anakin hates sand. Let's talk about Handen Christensen as Anakin he's awful as Anakin and he gives terrible performance. The love relationship between Anakin and Padme is also terrible you don't by into these 2 being in love at all because they are not supposed to be together and Padme is so on and off about her feelings for Anakin it's just bad. Overall, attack of the clones is not amazing Star Wars it's mediocre but it's not as bad as everyone says it is.

From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed.

The film picks up 10 years later with now Anakin Skywalker growing up and more yet he's still being trained by Obi-Wan you can see that young Skywalker is stubborn and soon may slip to the evil side of the dark empire as the top Jedi masters can even feel it. However in the current time Anakin has started a romance with Padme who use to be a former senator and things are more complex when the empire puts out an assassination attempt out on her life. The Jedi army then has to take her back to Naboo for her protection. Still in this episode it's more of the same of space fighting and good facing evil as it's a build up to a revealing episode III.,-0.04705882352941176,0.45441176470588235

"After the great box office The Phantom Menace, George Lucas returns to the penultimate part of its hit series, this being the second in chronological order. Lucas back in the direction and the script alongside Jonathan Hales. As a major news, the Episode II, is the first big-budget film to be shot entirely with digital cameras.",0.1390625,0.27604166666666663
"While I didn't think it was possible for a Star Wars film to be more hated than Episode 1, Episode 2 fits that description according to many fans. Just like The Phantom Menace, this won't be an easy one to talk about because it's often considered the weakest movie in a trilogy that's already been criticized for years. To be fair for just a moment, I didn't think this movie was that unimpressive, but it's still not on par with the original three films. The movie does have more of an emphasis on action this time around, so overall, I feel it's an improvement. Not to mention, it furthers Anakin's story a bit more and we get to see him fight with his inner evil more vigorously. Attack of the Clones takes place about a decade after the events of episode 1. Anakin (Hayden Christensen) is now a Jedi Padawan to Obi-Wan Kenobi, and they have been assigned to protect Padme on the city planet of Coruscant. She's there in order to get the Galactic Senate to authorize creation of a military in order to fight against a separatist movement. This movement is led by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), who was the mentor to Qui-Gon Jinn from the Phantom Menace. Dooku has turned to the Dark Side and created his own Separatist faction. Anakin, Padme, and Obi-Wan meet up again and Anakin is disappointed to find out the girl he's thought about every day for a decade seems to be indifferent towards him. Little do they all realize that she is being tracked by an assassin named Zam Wessell, who is part of an alien race that can change their physical appearance. Zam tries to kill Padme while she sleeps with two poisonous creatures resembling centipedes, but Anakin and Obi-Wan disrupt her attempt and pursue her in a flying speeder car. After latching onto her speeder and making her crash, Anakin tries to interrogate Zam and find out who she's working for, but someone shoots a toxic dart into her neck to prevent her from talking. Obi-Wan meets with his friend Dexter at a diner to discuss the origin of the strange projectile, and Dex tells him it could have only come from a planet called Kamino which is inhabited by a race of aliens who clone people for use in warfare. Obi-Wan searches some archives and finds out that the planet apparently doesn't exist, and then deduces it was intentionally removed to keep its existence a secret. The Jedi Council tells Obi-Wan to head toward the center of a gravity field where the planet is supposed to be, and he'll find it. After travelling to Kamino, he discovers that they have vast cloning facilities located there and a huge order has been placed by someone named Sifo Dyas in order to build up an army. Obi-Wan talks with a bounty hunter named Jango Fett, who has one of the clones as his son, Boba. All the thousands of clones on Kamino are based on Jango's DNA, and he's also the person who killed Zam to shut her up. Obi-Wan finds out that Dyas has actually been dead for years, and whoever placed the order did so without permission from the Jedi Council. Knowing his ruse has been discovered, Jango and his son try to leave the planet, and Obi-Wan fights Jango in an attempt to stop his starfighter (the Slave 1) from taking off. He's unable to do so, but manages to throw a beacon onto the ship's hull so he knows where they're going. Concurrently, Anakin and Padme get more involved with each other romantically, even though Jedi are supposed to be aloof to this kind of thing. Anakin senses through the Force that his mother is in great pain and decides to go to Tatooine to look for her, disobeying his mandate to protect Padme in the process. Anakin meets up with Watto again who confesses he sold Shmi years ago to someone named Cliegg Lars. After seeking him out and talking with him, Anakin finds that his mother was abducted by tusken raiders and is presumed dead. He makes his way to a distant tusken raider settlement and tries to rescue Shmi, but she dies in his arms. For the first time, Anakin completely loses control of himself and kills absolutely everybody in the camp. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan follows Jango to the planet of Geonosis, where Viceroy Nute Gunray has been trying to assemble a huge droid army. He's also the one responsible for trying to kill Padme. Dooku is here as well, and Obi-Wan is eventually captured. Padme and Anakin fly to Geonosis to help him, but are also captured by overwhelming enemy forces. Padme, Obi-Wan and Anakin are sent to be killed in a gladiatorial style arena featuring large alien animals, but large amounts of Jedi and clone gunships ambush the event. Jango is killed, and Dooku manages to escape on a speeder bike. Anakin and Obi-Wan fly over huge battlefields and come face to face with Dooku in his hideout. Dooku subdues both of them pretty effortlessly, and even though Master Yoda shows up to assist, he still manages to escape to Coruscant. Dooku has with him the plans for an extremely powerful weapon (The Death Star) which will be used as a trump card against the Republic's foes. Finally, Anakin and Padme are married on the planet Naboo. This movie is often considered to be either the worst or second worst Star Wars film, but I didn't think it was that terrible. It does have a lot of boring scenes (mostly the love scenes between Anakin and Padme), but the action scenes are good as ever. A lot of people criticize Hayden's ability to act, which I kind of agree with. Many of the scenes between him and Natalie Portman still make me cringe, and even the latter's character in the movie is put off by him. I did at least appreciate how they show him slowly transitioning to being evil. Once Anakin takes revenge for the death of his mom and starts ranting to Padme about how he should be all powerful, his path to becoming Darth Vader is assured. Christopher Lee in all his glory is also in this, and for me, that alone makes it worth it. Jango Fett was also one of the best things about this movie, since he's one of the most proficient fighters in Star Wars but doesn't have use of the Force. I shouldn't need to clarify, but the soundtrack is once again absolutely great (John Williams always is). Overall, it might be true that Attack of the Clones is one of the weaker Star Wars movies, but it still manages to be better that Episode 1 (even if that's not saying much). It does at least move the story forward in a believable way.",0.0845861018826135,0.5506782945736433

This new kid Hayden Christensen was perfect for Anakin. He played a very convincing person I could forsee becoming Darth Vader. He better be in Episode 3. And Natalie Portman, she gets more and more beautiful in every movie. Ewan McGregor is the best Obi Wan Kenobi. I hope that the actor playing Jango returns as Boba Fett (with some growth acceleration) for Episode 3. This movie was such an excellent parallel to Empire Strikes Back.

"Whatever you thought about Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace, whatever you disliked about Jar Jar Binks or the little child Anakin had been in the first part of this spectacular space saga, forget you must about all your concerns! I had the possibility to watch Episode II this night at about 1:00 o'clock in the city of Munich/Germany at a charity preview screening! What I saw some 13 hours ago is the movie of the movies, the movie every true fan and every moviegoer has waited for! This time director George Lucas managed to deliver a fine performance in directing, storytelling and visualization of the great events that take place in this 2 hours 22 minutes thrill-ride I'd like to call the second best Star Wars movie of all time which means that this is the second best movie of all time (after the original Episode IV - but, hey, I've only seen it one time until now so things could hint at a No. 1 spot in my personal list!). The movie's atmosphere is far more darker than that of Episode I and I think that Episode II is even darker than Episode V. The galaxy's in a real turmoil, because of the separatists that want to leave the Republic. The story has a wonderful pace I'd like to compare with Episode IV. There's not a single second one feels bored or one feels strange about anything. All the different subplots are developed perfectly and find their climax in a gigantic battle in the end of the movie. The actors all deliver excellent performances. Especially Hayden Christensen's performance marks the perfect portrayal of the later Darth Vader. You can really feel his inner battle with the dark side. He is a good person with a good heart, but certain things make him turn. In Episode II, during one of the highlights of the movie, Anakin is confronted with his first dark actions. It will take your breath away, I promise you! Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor do a great job and keep up the fine pace of the movie. McGregor gets to do a lot this time and some of his quotations will be remembered! The hidden star of the movie, now one can deny that, is Yoda. Yes, you heard it right, Yoda. The Jedi-Master shows the audience why he is the greatest Jedi of all time and also proves that the advance of digital animation can't be stopped...... The Special Effects are totally exciting, excellent and brilliant, but they never stand above the story, no, they drive the story forward and underline all the aspects of the movie. The CG-characters in this movie look so realistic (especially Yoda) that you just won't believe it. Compared with Spider-Man (a very good movie, too!) where the animated Spider-Man can be recognized during a lot of scenes as an animation Episode II's CG-characters interact perfectly with the real actors. And talking about technical aspects...... I didn't see any hint that the pictures were entirely shot digitally! The picture looks brilliant, colourful and very rich! The sound effects are superb and John Williams' score perfectly underlines this motion picture experience! What else to say than well, I already have my tickets for the midnight premiere on Wednesday/Thursday and I'll again enjoy a hell of thrill-ride watching this movie that tells us a story of good versus evil from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

"After what many perceived to be a weak entry in the prequel trilogy of the star wars movies with regards to TPM. Lucas still 'did his own thing' and produced one of the most breathtaking, exhilarating and fantastic star wars films to date. In this film we have already established characters thrust upon the cinema screen once again. The opening scroll is simpler than in TPM, it doesn't require us to think, it just puts us into the right frame of mind to pick up the story. As soon as we see a ship gliding through the foggy clouds we see straight away that something is amiss in the republic. The bright and breezy republic in the previous film seems to be bathed in fog. Difficult to see the dark side is. Lucas said these are silent movies and the visuals tell their own story and it happens a lot in this film, like the Darth Vader silhouette that had no digital tinkering whatsoever . The footage of Anakin with his robes on was basically a mirror image of darth vader but without the helmet. The footage of Padme next to him was strikingly reminiscent of Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi. Absolutely everything in this movie is intriguing, Obi-Wan Kenobi investigates a clone facility on the planet of Kamino. A mysterious Sifo Dyas placed an order for the Clone army based on a template of a Bounty Hunter called Jango Fett. Jango Fett states he was employed by a man called Darth Tryannus. We find a former Jedi, Count Dooku knows all about the corruption in the senate, even if the Jedi arnt yet aware and plans to do something about it. Secretly creating a new order with the goal to build an army powerful enough to fight the Republics army. A republic army which was mysteriously started at the Clone facility even though the Jedi Council were not aware! Confused? Nointrigued? Most definitely. Anakin Skywalker also gets given a sole mission on his own. Its here that the much vaunted love story begins. To be honest, it's a bit choppy and seems rushed. Its not a smooth romance like in The Empire Strikes Back, instead it's a romance which reeks of desperation, as if the characters themselves know about their impending doom and they just want to be as one before the inevitable happens. The deleted scenes on the DVD really should have been implemented within the film. They are gold, with regards to character motivations and shows little glimpses of their affection to each other. Would have made the final, declaration of love scene less jarring. In fact, would have been completely smooth and believable. The final showpiece in this film is the Clone Wars, they begin on a planet called Geonosis and this is where the film gives us a scene so wonderful it just keeps on piling the cherry's on top of the cake. A superb full scale war better than anything in any star wars movie happens, its absolute mayhem and its absolutely brilliant. But it doesent end there, we have not one lightsaber fight, not two, but three. With the third being one of the most memorable of all time. Also, a plot point that culminated in A New Hope makes its entrance here and it left me absolutely gob smacked Basically, this film is everything you would want in a star wars movie. Is it the best star wars film out there? Quite possible, difficult to call. Had George Lucas just gone with the flow and put in the Padme/Anakin deleted scenes plus toned down the over bearing nature of Anakin in the fireplace scene (after reading an earlier draft there's some vocal foreplay at the beginning that would have been great to have in the final movie) then this would have been the best Star Wars film without a doubt. We see intrigue, we see action and we see the galaxy begin to rot away in a very obvious way. The beginning of the end.",0.2147370228705845,0.5762606495483207

You'd find better action sequences on a cheap games console and better acting in a primary school production of the wizard of oz. And the blame lies squarely on Lucas' shoulders.

The only people who come out relatively unscathed are the traditionally camped-up hammer-horror-style bad guys and Ewan McGregor's continuing pastiche of Alec Guinness.

As a child, the more complicated storyline was difficult to follow but now I think it is fantastic. Disney taking over Star Wars is like the Republic being destroyed and becoming the Empire; Kathleen Kennedy is the perfect characterization for Darth Sidious. Slowly biding her time and then being given ultimate control because of her earned trust. Once the trust was given by Lucas however, she revealed herself for what she truly is. It's quite perfect....serendipitous really. Whatever the case, Kathleen Kennedy and Disney Lucasfilm can't hold a candle to what George and his colleagues did in the past. Try as she might.

"George Lucas' long-awaited STAR WARS prequel THE PHANTOM MENACE divided critics and disappointed many fans, but the film still earned enough money to justify continuing the new trilogy. Still, it was clear that fans were shocked by EPISODE I's uneven mix of childish goofiness and stoic sluggishness, and many hoped Lucas would make amends with the subsequent entries. Unfortunately, the second prequel, ATTACK OF THE CLONES, is no improvement; in fact it comes across as the nadir of both the prequel trilogy and the whole STAR WARS franchise. While some might argue that THE PHANTOM MENACE is more deserving of that title, in reality, it was EPISODE II that truly brought a once respected series to a new low. Carrying over many of the same faults as its predecessor (stale acting and dialogue, overuse of CGI), and introducing two major new ones, it was almost enough to make many wonder what had become of Lucas' talents in the years since the original trilogy. Even with the argument that its primary purpose is to function as a transition between Episodes I and the far superior III, it still comes up short, the occasional decent moment notwithstanding.",0.08635179924242424,0.4910511363636364

"Yes, of all six. At this point, nothing(or infinitely, insignificantly little) remains ""real"" in these movies. That, in itself, doesn't have to be a problem. But we can tell. It doesn't feel right. Sin City doesn't have this problem, nor does 300. The effects are, technically speaking, amazing, but nothing else in this really goes beyond being ""decent"". The romance lacks credibility(and yes, I am aware that some of it was left on the cutting room floor, but we're going by the finished product, not the intent). The overall story... well, Lucas gives many fans something they may have wanted in spite of there being absolutely no basis for it, and sacrifices it making sense in doing so. This tries too hard to tie in with the OT(which, I should point out so that no one mistakes me for someone who grew up with it, I didn't attentively view until Episode I was out). The dialog gets to be downright painful, with one even contradicting something in the first(written by the same guy, a few years earlier...!). The plot isn't that engaging, and things that ought to be in the next are here(and vice versa). The pacing is reasonable. The light-saber bits could be considerably better(they are particularly unimpressive compared to Phantom Menace), and at times, it's the tamest it's been since Return, although it isn't all bad. The action in general, mostly, it's just overdone, and goes on for too long. There are cool ideas and concepts, but their lackluster execution results in them merely being unable to be used soon by more talented film-makers. The title could be that of a 50's schlocky sci-fi flick. The battles do have notable, interesting aspects... in the editing and cinematography, mainly. The actors have put in solid performances elsewhere, or, at least, less embarrassing ones. Characters could stand improvement, and, you know, consistency. The score is still good. The DVD holds over a dozen(not all more than minutes long) featurettes, deleted scenes, trailers, TV-spots and a commentary.

"Star Wars: Episode II- Attack of the Clones is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a mostly terrific cast. Most Star Wars fans won't consider it a work of art, but it is a huge improvement from the Phantom Menace no doubt, the story is well executed, the character development is much better and the comic relief is great, it was unbearable in Phantom Menace, with new character Jar Jar Binks being the main source of laughs, this time around it is back to C3P0, which made me very happy, his lines were genuinely funny and not just cringe to listen to. There are some poor moments in this film, while I do think Hayden Christensen shines in some scenes, particularly the one with his mother, he is very weak many times, particularly his parts with Natalie Portman, there is no chemistry between either of them, no indication of passion and all of their dialogue is very cliché, I think they wanted Anakin and Padmé's relationship to be the Han and Leia of the prequels, but they didn't succeed. The performances are much better this time around, Ewan McGregor steals the show as Obi-Wan Kenobi, he wasn't worth much praise in the first one, but this time he is playing a much older and wiser version of the character, which he delivered very well and is one of the highlights of the prequel trilogy, Christopher Lee is outstanding as the villain, though this film once again suffers from taking a ridiculously long time before introducing us to its main villain, there are also great performances from Samuel L. Jackson and, of course, voice actors Anthony Daniels and Frank Oz, who is given a bigger and better role as Yoda this time around that is sure to please fans. Though it may still be missing that sci-fi magic that is very evident in the original trilogy, Star Wars: Episode II-Attack of the Clones is still a very enjoyable movie that should impress fans, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure or sci-fi film.

"The ""Star Wars"" saga always had its faults, with wooden acting, clichéd plots, eye rolling moments, cheap puns, etc. But ""Star Wars"" and its immediate successors also had characters, and one had an emotional investment with those characters. The early effects looked bad (seeing the movie when it first came out in the '70s one thought the Cantina scene looked like a bad Friday night Halloween party). But they had real people moving through real space, often on obvious sets (you can't make an orbiting death star look like anything but a set, so let's cut them some slack). ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Clones"" suffered from the same faults as listed in the first sentence, but ""PM"" had the more egregious faults of the stupid pod-race and the annoying kid. ""Clones"" had so many digital effects it stopped looking like real people inhabiting real spaces, but a cartoon with live-action, like the Toonville of Roger Rabbit. Lucas does effects better than anyone and there are wonderful moments of digital technology in this movie, but creating whole worlds and digital characters makes it look too cartoony, especially when real people leap off buildings or when characters get stuck on some sort of Rube Goldberg conveyor belt. Perhaps it's because ""Clones"" stuck in the middle of a Trilogy, but the storyline went nowhere. And does anyone really give a hang for Anakin or Padme?

But it has enough lightsaber action and battle sequences to make it worth the watch. The acting isn't really good but Hayden Christensen put on the most wooden performance out of the bunch. And he is suppose to be a very emotionally driven character, but he failed because of the wooden performance. Despite Anakin being a incompetent apprentice because of him being very driven by his emotions, it was understandable to a degree. So I can't take that away from the character.

"Attack of the Clones is probably my less favorite Star Wars movie. Don't get me wrong, I love the originals movies more, but I don't hate the prequels like some fans do. Director George Lucas didn't rape my childhood. The prequels were pretty interesting for me. A story about Anakin Skywalker's rise and fall, how the empire got started, details about the Clone Wars, all of these ideas sound good. But it was executed in a way that wasn't that well done. It didn't felt like Star Wars, we came to love as children. The film is set 10 years after the events in 1999's Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, when the galaxy is on the brink of civil war. Under the leadership of a rebel Jedi named Count Dooku AKA General Robert E. Lee rip off (Christopher Lee), thousands of planetary systems threaten to secede from the Galactic Republic. When an assassination attempt is made on Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman), the former Queen of Naboo, Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is assigned to protect her, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is assigned to investigate the assassination attempt. Soon, Anakin, Padmé, and Obi-Wan are drawn into the heart of the Separatist territories and the beginning of a new threat to the galaxy, the Clone Wars. The first thing, I would notice about Attack of the Clones is how boring it is. There is barely any action in a film titled 'Star Wars' in this film. Even with the limited action scenes, with all the visual effects, it doesn't look real enough to care. No sense of danger in a world full of CGI. We know its CGI characters fighting other CGI characters. Why do we care about the clones? We have no feelings for them if they get killed nor do we care about the robots. The rest of the film is replace with talking scenes about politics, non-realistic love, and unrelated issues we can't even put our hands around. The audience is expected to accept too many things that we are told and not told about. Too much talk, and not enough show. Honestly, we not shown how the character feel about each other, but told how they are. How on Earth, is Anakin and Obi-Wan even good friends, they sound like they can't stand each other, most of the film? They complain about each other way too much. Plus, their action doesn't match their words. Obi Wan is supposed to be the mentor and Anakin is the loose-cannon, but in some scene, the roles are reverse. Obi Wan does stupid stuff like jumping out of a building onto a probe droid. Then Anakin jump into another speeder. Man, these scenes are way unrealistic and cartoony. Plus, the whole assassin plot really doesn't go anywhere, anyways as it tossed out halfway through the film. It was as useless as the shift shifter assassin who doesn't use his/her shift shifter powers. The whole relationship with Anakin with Padme is awkward and flat, too. It seem forced as hell as both have no reason why to love with each other. Both character are total different from each other and share little in common. Anakin is clearly violent, arrogant, and Padme still take the guy. It seem like one-dimension romance like Romeo and Juliet where they just madly fall for each other for no reason. Why couldn't they just make Padme tempt Anakin to sin by loving, similar to Eve tempting Adam with the apple? It would have made more sense. I don't understand why Senator Amidala isn't allow to love. Politicians have sex all the time, everybody knows that. Plus, I don't understand why love is banned in the Jedi Order. Its OK, to get angry as a Jedi, but to love is bad. The Jedi Order seems some of the dumbest people on Earth. First off, nobody check up on the missing Sith Lord from the last movie; second off, none of the Jedi had a clue that an army is being build and the guy that probably build it is probably the Sith Lord, Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). It makes no sense. This movie makes Yoda (Frank Oz) look so dumb. I was deeply angry to see Yoda is force to fight with a Lightsaber. I thought of him like peaceful loving figure like Gandhi who didn't need a lightsaber because of his wisdom and knowledge. He was great Jedi master, because he master the force, not the lightsaber. I hate the fact, that George Lucas even have a scene where Yoda train children with lightsabers. Isn't that a bit dangerous for children? Why is Yoda doing this, anyways? Yoda never train Luke with a lightsaber in 1980's Empire Strike Back. He use the force, not weapons. In the end, the massive story and the virtual filmmaking kinda ruin of the film for some. I did like the movie. I don't want to leave this review with a sour note with only negative notes. There are good things about the film. Epic battle scenes. Another great score from John Williams. Alright acting from all the main actors. Great themes like warnings signs of fascism and how democracy can quickly fall. I didn't mind the poetic similarities in the prequels that remind us of the original source. I was pretty pleased to see that Jar Jar Binks has only a minor role. Last, I did like great world building of the film. The movie is watchable and still need to be check out if a big Star Wars fan. If you happen to be one of the very few movie audiences never to see a Star Wars film. Watch the Originals first, not this lousy movie.

"Perhaps even now, nearly 3 years since this movie first appeared on screens, it may be too early to fairly judge the second chapter of the Star Wars saga, The Attack of the Clones. As the pieces of this awkward jig-saw puzzle that is the Star Wars saga come together, it has become more and more difficult to judge the stories of each chapter. How will it set up the next movie? How much of the first and second movies relate to the last 3 movies? Do we need to care about these characters? After the final movie of the the 6 movie series by George Lucas hits the screens in May 2005, the successes and failures of The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones will finally be clear. I say all of this because I have always been a fan of the Star Wars movies, and as excited as I was to see new movies about the time long ago in the galaxy far, far away, it has been hard to say that these first two movies have been what was expected. The original Star Wars movies were full of joy and whimsy, going places we have never been before, battling an enemy we have never seen before, but can identify with. Good vs. Evil is easy to see, and perhaps it's that the early episodes in the saga are murky in who's good and who isn't hinders the films. The Attack of the Clones looks great; we know everything is generated by a computer, but still looks right and good enough that we accept it as real. My favorite scene is how the special effects artists zooms from one passing ship to another, making it look like it was shot with a real camera. The acting is wooden, perhaps encouraged by the dry script. The love story we are subjected to is pretty lame, which for ""forbidden"" love, that's hard to do. Where is Han Solo and Princess Leia's sassy triste when you really need it? Ewan McGregor is good enough as Obi-Won Kenobi, but the other characters are unmemorable and uninteresting. The story itself, I will say this, it does leave a lot of interesting places for the 3rd film to go, assuming of course Lucas does that. I said the same thing after Phantom Menace but Attack of the Clones didn't really capitalize on the openings that were there. Again, the ultimate judge on this film is how it fits in with the other segments of the Star Wars saga. If this was the build-up to a climatic Revenge of the Sith, then it will be worth your time to check out Episode 2. If the third movie veers off into other plot points, then don't waste your time with Attack of the Clones. Just go out and rent The Empire Strikes Back for a well done middle cog to a 3 movie trilogy.",0.14900879543736684,0.4655294441008729
"I always forgave George Lucas for the relative horror that was 'Return of the Jedi', because it did have some elements of greatness alongside some of the worst decisions about the franchise ever. I won't go into detail here. The new films I cannot forgive however, because they show so clearly what is wrong with the action-film industry today: artifice, shallowness, and the unfortunate demographic and marketing discovery that the dumber you make something nowadays, the more money there is to be made from it.

You know that Anakin soon or later will get it on with Padme, and the actors know that and we know that, but most of their scenes feel so forced that i find myself laughing at one of the most corning love dialogs in movie history.",0.1029647435897436,0.43076923076923074

Natalie Portman is okay, but Hayden Cristensen doesn't have ANYTHING similar in his looks to Luke Skywalker. So, this was not good at all to me.In the second Episode of Star Wars ''Attack of the Clones '', 10 years have passed since the first Episode, and now we have Obi Wan Kenobi as a master and Anakin as his young adult padawan.Padme, ex Queen, is now a Senator representing her world. Anakin behaves like a rebel, and he is very arrogant because he knows about his own abilities;Sometimes he has lapses and thoughts that will lead him to be the famous Darth Vader in the future.(One thing is true: it's funny to see Anakin saying that he considers Obi Wan as his father..sounds very ironical when you know how Star Wars is going to end).",0.14375000000000002,0.46770833333333334

Including Jango Fett, which is another treat by himself to come from this movie. From the fights on Kamino to the incredible air scrimmage above Geonosis I am just speechless.

"This is a film that took three of the most beloved films of all time and sold their souls to CGI. The original Star Wars Trilogy were not labelled as the greatest films ever made because of Light Sabres, or Storm Troopers, or groundbreaking motion capture special effects, but because of the human side. The quality of the acting from Sir Alec Guinness, the chemistry between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, the excellent dialogue that made every line a memorable quote and the context of faith and religion are what made them so everlasting. In this film Ewan McGregor's acting is surprisingly wooden for such a talented actor, Hayden Christensen has less chemistry with Natalie Portman than a 12 year old student's test tube, the dialogue is boring, the lines are cheesy and clichéd, there does not seem to be any actual emphasis on plot, it just being an excuse to glue one over-long action set piece to another, so the intrigue disappears fast and the themes and contexts are given a back seat to (admittedly impressive) CGI.

There's more dialogue than action in this Star Wars instalment.",0.07651515151515151,0.4416666666666666
"Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones is the eagerly anticipated sequel to Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. After three years since the original let-down, we find out that this one won't include Jar Jar Binks as a central character, or won't have an irritating ten year old who'll play Anakin Skywalker, we even see a glimpse of what could be everyone's favorite bounty hunter, Boba Fett! We all reassure ourselves that Star Wars would get better now, and stay true to that classic style we all cherished. But the same thing with The Phantom Menace occurred again, most fans didn't like the movie for reasons we'll explain throughout this review. This movie, like The Phantom Menace suffers from a bad script, though not as bad as The Phantom Menace's. Firstly the dialog between Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker in the elevator scene at the start of the film. It's a nice little bit where the two exchange words about their previous adventures together and show a friendship. Though we as an audience don't know what they're talking about because we haven't seen those adventures. George Lucas can't just simply explain to us that in that one minute scene that they're friends, you have to show it in the actual movie, like they did with the Lethal Weapon franchise. Like when Martin Riggs reminds Roger about the time he was stuck to a toilet in case a bomb went off in part 2, the two smile remembering that bizarre moment and we as an audience remember it too, relating to the friendship. Here the script takes one short scene in an elevator to tell us that the two are friends because... They were meant to be good friends according to Obi Wan's story to Luke in Episode IV. Then for the rest of the movie they do there own separate things showing concentration in the wrong area. Obi Wan's off finding this Clone Army on the planet Kamino and Anakin's on Naboo protecting Padme from an assassination. Now people criticize the film for Anakin's (Hayden Christensen's) acting performance in the film, but this is a false claim. The actor does very well if the right script is given to him, the bad acting is a result of poor direction by George Lucas. For some reason the love story dialog between Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) and Anakin is so horrible because... Of the way Hayden Christensen says the lines!? Almost every character in this movie has to say stupid lines too, why does all the critique come down upon Hayden!? Although Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan makes his lines sound much better, seeing that he is in fact a better actor. Now another reason why everyone dislikes this movie is in fact for the love story, they say it's awkward and forced but we say it's beautiful though very clichéd. There really is no problem with the love story other than it's clichéd as hell, and that great John Williams score doesn't help either! But with all the beautiful backdrops and locations, who cares, we think it's perfect how Anakin and Padme fall in love. The movie also uses too much CGI, but it makes for some thrilling action scenes, this movie has he best actions scenes out of the whole entire saga. It's got the Bounty Hunter chase through Coruscant, Obi Wan VS Jango Fett, the Jedi Battlle in that arena, the beginning of the Clone Wars, and Yoda's epic light saber duel. Although Yoda having a light saber totally clashes with everything he stands for in Episode V, it's still pretty cool to see him whipping out and wielding his very own light saber. Then Jango Fett, the father of Boba is also a very cool addition to the Star Wars Saga, we maybe even prefer him to Boba, just for his awesome battle with Mace Windu on Geonosis. It is also interesting to see Chancellor Palpatine take his first step into becoming the Emperor in one of the ending scenes, as he controls the Clone Army. Another great thing about the film is Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, back in his old comic self again. But another major flaw is the brief relationship between Anakin and Owen Lars. At the end of Revenge of the Sith he receives the child of his stepbrother (Anakin) from a guy he didn't even know (Obi Wan). Anyway, comparing these positives, Attack of the Clones is a thrilling space adventure film featuring new awesome planets we love like Kamino and Geonosis. It pushes the action to new heights, and is our personal favorite of the saga, making it number one. Though for some reason George Lucas writes Anakin as a bad apple. Anakin is not much like Luke Skywalker at all, for he is not totally being a good guy in this film, this is seen after his mothers death when he mindlessly slaughters countless Tusken Raiders. And when he attempts to run at the movies' villain with a light saber with hate and anger! Though there are some scenes where he's kind-hearted, most of it is just him being arrogant, but this doesn't really bother us. Another great thing about the film is Count Dooku, he makes the film very enjoyable but the slightly UN-EVEN pacing of the film makes him enter a full hour in! Episode II is an epic story that goes in depth at the look of how the death of Anakin's mother will influence his fall to the dark side and how his love for Padme will cross a forbidden Jedi rule. The only thing wrong with this film, that bugs us enough to point out is the relationship between Obi Wan and Anakin, which should have been expanded. Nonetheless Episode II is the strongest of the saga but suffers from an onslaught of under-ration by fans just because of a few reasons they that can't even explain...",0.12702134285467623,0.5197222530555865
"George Lucas's ""Star Wars: Episode II-- Attack of the Clones"" is pretty good, and a theatrical puzzle-- not necessarily in a good way. Episode II has a few things going for it: a talented cast including Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson, is a gorgeous movie to look at, and has a whole mythology which has become part of popular culture. Early on there is breath-taking ""sky diving"" scene in an aerial city with Jedi Padwan, Anikan Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), and his mentor, a now older Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). This is well done-- great pace, action, full of life. The movie, however soon bogs down. ",0.26407407407407407,0.5148148148148148
"This movie gets way too much hate for what its getting. Let me state that no it is not the best star wars movie nor prequel, but its not the worst whatsoever. ill point out the positives of the movie followed by the negatives. first off, geonosis. you cannot tell me the battle on geonosis was not enjoyable. literally the first big fight with all lightsabers and the odd republic blaster from padmè then the clones. Second off, Anakin and Obi wan vs Dooku. The fight was great, although short lived, we got to see yoda fight for the first time and it did not disappoint. thirdly, the beginning of anakins anger. Throughout the movie you can see how the anger builds up, in his nightmares of his mom shmi and then the death of his mother. Which i believe was set up by palpatine as a part of his plan, and that his love for padme was starting to interfere with him and his training. lastly, just padme. i mean cmon how can u not enjoy this like padme definitely makes the movie better guys. and for the negatives, all i can say is the cgi is not the best and the romance is a bit overdone. hate this movie? go watch things u may have missed on youtube, points out so many cool things that make rewatching the movie a lot more interesting.",0.025694444444444447,0.4351388888888889

"""Attack of the Clones"" opens 10yrs later and finds Queen, er, Senator Padme Amidala still playing her look alike decoy games even though this surely would've been public knowledge after the events of ""Phantom Menace"". Weak. Then we find Anakin now about 20yo as apprentice to longer haired Obi-Wan but when they meet Padme, love-lorn Anakin goes way off script backtalking Obi-Wan forcing the latter to chastise him in front of everyone. This scene is beyond ridiculous since any such recalcitrant behavior would've been disciplined out of him by this point. So weak. Then the speeder chase scene at night in a lot of multi-level traffic proceeds mishap-free as if there were no other vehicles in sight. Weak. And this is just the opening few minutes! The dialogue is just immature at best, and all Anakin's patronizing ""yes, Master""'ing is so tiresome. When the assailant/fugitive is captured by Obi and Anakin - which btw are neglecting their primary protection duty of Padme - the bounty hunter who hired her darts her dead when he could've as easily darted them! They apparently didn't ""sense"" that danger! There are key story elements that dangle like loose ends. For instance, what is this prophecy of One who will bring the Force back into balance? That was first brought up in Phantom but it's not detailed/described, there's no evidence the Force is out of balance! There's just this unsupported bantering about it. The whole Padme/Anakin dynamic which is supposed to be Jedi protecting a Senator is a dumb romantic courtship. Someone as influential and attractive as Padme would've long been taken by another politician to increase their power structure, but instead we're treated to an adolescent fever dream. The rest of the film suffers from the same half-baked writing and direction, thanks again to an unchecked George Lucas. This is the poor level of storytelling/film-making you get when the same guy is the only executive producer, director, writer, and editor!

I don't care what anyone says, Anakin saying he killed ""not just the men"" always will be a genuinely amazing and heart wrenching performance by Hayden Christiansen. Every other aspect of the movie, I also love: The war on Geonosis is incredible, as are the lightsaber duels with Dooku. Following Obi Wan through his adventure to Kamino was a load of fun and laid the ground work for the republic's army perfectly. The list goes on and on!!! Yes, Anakin was a little bit creepy, and yes a lot of the CGI hasn't aged well. Aside from those two small setbacks, this is an awesome movie that progresses a lot of aspects of the Star Wars story, and most importantly, lays the groundwork of the fall of Anakin Skywalker and rise of Darth Vader.",0.21875,0.5818181818181819

"This installment of Star Wars was much better than Episode I which in my opinion was shockingly average. I still felt that George didn't learn his lesson about over using computer graphics indiscriminately from Episode I. Although the effects were more realistic, it still looked fake during good part of the movie. Plot line is pretty strained it seemed. Too many elements had to be crammed into 2 hrs. So there was no interesting plot development for the story or the characters (although, part about a 7ft tall gray alien cloning human soldiers was an interesting plot twist, and the battle scene between Obi-Wan and the bounty hunter was one of the few excellent scenes in this movie). Another annoying thing was that there was too many of everything on CG shots. Too many buildings, too many flying cars, too many people, too many weapons, too many animals, too many foot soldiers, they filled the screen, but at the end of the day, they all looked the same failing to give the cue that we're in a different place, situation or a planet. Aliens looked fake, which also was true for all non-human Jedi council members. Cut back on CGI, focus on plot and acting but as ROTS would show, none of the lessons from making each episodes are carried over on to the next.",0.19055555555555556,0.5152777777777778

"Existing among Star Wars non-apologists are subdivisions who realized at different moments that this film was beyond repair.

Nevertheless, few can contradict that the clear point of no return was Yoda, now reduced to a CGI. Decently portrayed in The Empire Strikes Back as a wise teacher, the little green guy here is everything and everywhere at once. First he presides over the Jedi Council (ok, I think the whole council thing has been played out about a thousand times over in science fiction). Next we see him teaching Jedi nursery school, going so far as having his pupils greet Ewan MacGregor with ""Helll ohhhh Mass Terrrr Obeeeeee Wannnnn"" as pronounced in younglingspeak. Later on, he appears as a George Patton-like General in the heat of battle, uttering what will surely be the century's most ridiculous line: ""Around the survivors a perimeter create!!!"" erasing any remaining doubt of Lucas's incompetence in writing dialogue.

"For fans of the original trilogy of films Attack of the Clones is made for you in mind. On that level it is immensely enjoyable. Those that are not interested would find it harded to get involved or wrapped up in because this movie will leave you asking a lot of question while it answers questions for fans. I personally liked this movie and I found the acting to be just fine. Hayden Christensen does a great job playing Anakin. The whole purpose of his character is to show how such a good kid could be swayed to do evil, to commit evil. Those that critizize the prequels do so because they expect it to be very dark and full of mayhem. Those looking for faults will find it because that's what they are looking for. If there is a criticism that I could levy it is these: 1. this movie is not made for those who know little to nothing about Star Wars. 2. the love story did not have to be so thin. As it stands it seems as if Amidala's affections are in response to her and Anakin's dire circumstances. I am a guy and I still thought some scenes should have been left in order to show some of Amidala's passion giving in to Anakin, a tad more teasing from Amidala to Anakin and vice versa. 3. Show a bit more of Anakin's vengence on the Tusken raiders camp. George Lucas intends for this movie to be darker but I believe he shyed away from this key point to Anakin's psyche here. Another theory I have as to why some are thrilled with AotC and some aren't is who you as the viewer identified with as a child watching the movies. As a child I saw the classic triology through the eyes of Luke Skywalker. Those of you who idetified with Han Solo would be hard pressed to find him in these prequels and for you the saga doesn't live up to what you remembered. There is really no skeptic of the 'Force' in these prequels. In these prequels I identify with Anakin and I wonder how he becomes Darth Vader? That to me is the whole point of the prequels and to me I really do want to see how that innocent little boy becomes so supremely evil. In Episode II there are hints to these machinations in Anakin's head. There is still so much ground to cover for George Lucas in the next installment and as a fan of great movies I can't wait to see it.",0.11053030303030305,0.5375980392156862

"11 years on from the first episode, we are presented with Episode 2 of the saga, and as realistic as it can be, the actors seem to age since then too, most notably young Anakin Skywalker, who in the Phantom Menace, was casted as Jake Lloyd, is performed by Hayden Christensen. Casting back to 1991 we pictured the droid army, an infinite number of battle droids helping the Trade Federation in their aim to dominate the Galaxy, we are now introduced to a new army for the Republic. Padmé Amidala arrives on Coruscant to vote on the creation of an army to assist the Jedi against the threat posed by a Separatist movement organised by the former a Jedi master Count Dooku. Dooku is a cunning figure, a dominant and evil mystery to viewers, it is never explicitly stated why he was tempered by the Dark side, after being an apprentice himself, under Master Yoda. The villain wears a tightly fitted cloak and his red lightsaber is fitted with a slightly bent casing. His wisdom is still present in his speech and his Jedi attributes are evident in combat, he gathers an immoral nature that makes him so detested, but no one can argue with the smoothness and class he applies to his business. Padmé avoids a narrow assassination upon her arrival to the Republic's capital and is extremely vulnerable, this calls for the protection of Jedi Knight Obi Wan Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker. Bounty Hunter Jango Fett marshalled a second assassination on the Queen, with the assassin being Zam Wesell; in a dramatised chase, she is killed by her employer, a Bounty Hunter, before she reveals her identity. The Jedi Council instruct Obi Wan to find the Bounty Hunter, and have Anakin take Padmé back to Naboo, where he expressing his romantic feelings for her. The pair's romance was hardly hinted at in Episode 1, but both seemed to connect well with one another, and became closer when Anakin travelled with the Starship out of Naboo, at the young age of 9. Obi Wan is lead to the ocean planet of Kamino, discovering the production of an army of clones for the Republic, with Bounty Hunter Jango Fett serving as their genetic template. Obi Wan believes Jango is the Bounty Hunter he is looking to find and asks to meet with him. The Bounty Hunter is situated in a small compact pod, where he lives with his son Boba. Jango and Kenobi battle briefly on a pad outside the quarters, whilst Boba fires up the Hunter's ship, Jango escapes on board and Obi Wan launches a beacon tracker onto the ship, enabling the Jedi to follow them to the planet of Geonosis, a deserted fumed planet, with very little signs of life. Anakin is troubled with visions of his mother Schmi and takes Padmé with him to find her, the two land on Tatooine in order to save her. Watto reveals he sold Schmi to a moisture farmer named Cliegg Lars, who freed and married her. Cliegg informs Anakin that his mother was abducted by a group of ruthless Tuskan Raiders weeks earlier and most likely dead. Anakin furiously heads towards the Tuskan campsite, finding Schmi tied up, unwell and in desperate need of help. Being still alive, Schmi seems pleased to see her son after so long, but dies, helpless in his arms. The anger develops inside Anakin and brutally destroys every last Tuskan visible on the settlement, later confessing to Padmé that he will do anything he can to protect those he loves. On Geonosis, Obi Wan finds out about a Separatist gathering led by Count Dooku, who is planning the development of a droid army with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray. Obi Wan reports the information back to the Jedi council, but is subdued by Separatist droids. Senate representative Jar Jar Binks proposes a vote to grant emergency powers to Chancellor Palpatine, the successful outcome allowing the clone army to be authorised. Anakin throughout the film is struggling mentally, in his sleep especially, appearing extremely self-conscious and fears that there is little good in the future, Padmé and Obi Wam the only characters keeping him sane. We see the anger and pain he feels most notably on Tatooine, implicitly stating he has a struggle controlling his emotions. He and Padmé head to Geonosis to save Obi Wan, but are captured by Jango Fett. Dooku sentences the trio to death and have them tied in the centre of a large coliseum to large stumps, soon to be confronted to large beasts. With the arena packed with viewers, along with the Dooku, the beasts are unleashed and head towards their destruction of the three figures; the feast is halted by a battalion of clone troopers, led by Yoda, Mace Windu and other Jedi. Windu, mastered by Samuel Jackson, clutches a purple lightsaber, unusual for a Jedi; in fact it was Jackson who proposed the idea so that in the battle, he could be easily spotted in his act of beheading the Bounty Hunter Jango Fett. And that he did during the ongoing chaos, causing a cry of despair from young Boba who watched from above. When the combat settles, a significant image displays Boba holding the mask of his father, in anguish as if he makes an unwritten agreement to carry on his legacy. Dooku's sudden evacuation is intercepted by Anakin and Obi W Wan, the three engage in a lightsaber duel, Dooku uses his experience to injure Obi Wan and sever Anakin's right arm, but is only greeted by his former master, Yoda. Yoda's withered, small frame slowly walks over to Dooku. Best known for his extreme knowledge of the force and uncommon technique of speech, the green bodied, green lightsabered maestro defends the two wounded Jedi. In an iconic scene, the two ancient individuals battle intensely, until Count Dooku uses Force powers to distract Yoda and flee to Coruscant, where he delivers information for a super weapon to Sith Master, Darth Sidious. Meanwhile, as the Jedi's acknowledge the beginning of the Clone Wars, Anakin is fitted with a robotic hand, secretly marrying Padmé by the waters on Naboo, with C-3PO and R2-D2 witnessing. The film ends with uncertainty for what the Sith will counteract the Clone Army with and questions if Anakin is psychologically well.

"Attack of The Clones is generally considered by most to be the worst Star Wars film and overall just a bad film and while I personally wouldn't go that far I think this is an incredibly flawed film that has a few redeeming features mainly to do with the final 30 minutes. This last act is truly fantastic, not only will an Star Wars fan take joy in seeing the true power of the Jedi but it's also just entertaining, the massive battle that has been built up has been extremely well executed and truly gave us a sense of the power of these two opposing forces. The final lightsaber battle of the film while not very intense internally is still fairly well choreographed and made for a somewhat epic conclusion, all the action sequences are very well done I just wish there had been more of them. The performances in this film are a bit of a mixed bad but the one undeniable positive of this entire trilogy is Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi, he just brings a wise nature yet vulnerability to this already iconic character not only in this film but the trilogy as a whole. However this film still has its fair share of flaws. For one while the last act is riveting and engaging the first two are dull and drab, just dialogue heavy exposition with no real heart or intensity to it, the characters are not built up in any way and the villains are given no motivation or backstory making giving them no really presence. The central romance in this movie just simply does not work mainly because the two actors have very little chemistry due to the poor dialogue and script. Green Screen environments are used frequently in this film and it always shows and comes across as incredibly fake. I really don't like criticising performances but here I have too Hayden Christensen was truly bad in this film, he never really embodied Anakin as a complex character but mainly as just a whiny brat that did not make for a compelling protagonist. This film also sets up some very good ideas or plot lines that are either brushed over or all but forgotten about and came across as lazy at times.",0.05117082787004665,0.5291952318514818

"""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" wasn't bad but it wasn't good as it was supposed to be. I'm a huge ""Star Wars"" fan. I was born and raised on ""Star Wars"" so besides George Lucas, I know what's best for the entire franchise. Unlike the original trilogy which anyone can enjoy, This ""Star Wars"" film seemed to be a film that was for the fans only. The story-line and the plot were perfect; it's just that other elements in the film didn't really agree with my ""Imperial"" taste. First of off, some of the goofiness that was in Episode I leaked out into this episode then some of the scenes that were in this film, even though it's science fiction, were a little too far-fetched, for example the scene where Obi-Wan Kenobi met up with Dexter Jettster in the diner that looked and sounded like an earthly diner from the 1950s. In a galaxy far far away why would there be a diner that resembles and sounds like an earthly diner from the 1950s just because it's a diner with a sloppy cook and waitresses with a little attitude and the part when the guy with the antennas on his head who tried to sell Obi-Wan some death sticks, I really wasn't feeling that one either. It was things like that that kept this film from being what is was supposed to be. I'm not being biased towards the original trilogy because that's what I'm used to, I'm just telling the honest truth because Episode III was absolutely great!",0.2420634920634921,0.6476190476190476

The musical score was awesome and the ending score of the movie was very well written. I am going to watch this movie again soon but tonight, I am watching SW3 and then back to 5 and 6. I am doing this to prepare myself for the upcoming SW7. I felt SW2 really put all the pieces together for the entire series and explained the forthcoming movies very well.

"Star Wars fans are always pleased with Lucas' film work. The reason why so many people seem to have a genuine feeling of disappointment with this film is because it is a slow build-up to things that really kick off in the next film Revenge of the Sith. So in order to follow the story, one must sit through such things as the conversations between Senator Palpatine and the Jedi Council or the courtly romance between Anakin and Padme Amidala. Anakin is no longer that same wide-eyed pod-racing champion and is now a Jedi Knight, and furthermore a teenager with a rebellious streak. In this film, we find that Anakin is now probably like 20 years old, he becomes attracted to Padme Amidala (who is supposed to be older than him but looks like she didn't change too much, in fact Anakin is taller than she is). At first, I was under the impression this film would be like Empire Strikes back in mood, tone and romance. Even Revenge of the Sith had more of that feeling. This film is good, make no mistake, full of fine cinematography, music and interesting scenes. The waterfalls of Naboo and the lake retreat are gorgeous to watch, as are the masses of Clones assembling and the starships we later will recognize as Star Destroyers. Yoda is now a full computer graphic designed character (he was still a puppet in Phantom Menace) and is able to fight and win the duel with Count Dooku (played by none other than Christopher Lee of 60's and 70's Dracula films. This is a fine film and worth watching as part of the saga.

"I'll not provide a synopsis as most people already have or will. Here, you'll find what I liked and didn't. First off, I was impressed but there were some things that are still lacking. Thankfully Jar Jar was only in the film just a bit which has been highly publicized. The film had some good action in it, but it still felt like something was missing and I've come up with the answer, which I'll get to in a moment. The revisit to Tatooine was interesting, as was the 'car' chase. I'm a little annoyed with the Anakin/Padmé story though. There was too much about the romance which would've been fine if it had been deeper or better written. As it was, I was moved to boredom during some of it. Also, Christensen tended to overact leading me to somewhat blanch at his acting. If you take out the love story, and bite the bullet on Christensen's animation, the movie is very good indeed. The visual effects are simply stunning. The new digital Yoda was amazing. I would've never guessed he was digital if I didn't already know it. I kept looking for 'proof' and found it only once when Yoda spoke directly to Padmé. I give the movie 9 stars out of 10. I deduct only one star for the writing in the love story. I won't deduct for the overacting simply because it strikes me that the writing is what may have been the cause. Outside of that, it's an excellent film.",0.2705009775171065,0.5182265046781176
"First off, Hayden Christensen (however you spell his name) has emotional constipation, mixed in with some bi-polar attacks of over-acting.

When Anakin and Padmé are at her hidden place, and they're talking about why they can't be together, the way he acts it out is pitiful. On top of that, he whines throughout the whole movie.

"Attack of the Clones is SO much better than Episode I, I can not even begin to count the ways.  The first and most important change is the toned down Jar-Jar.  This is without a doubt the WORST Lucas creation, and I was VERY happy to see he didn't have much screen time.  Another change was the use of the Jedi council, especially Yoda.  I was EXTREMELY impressed by the battle between Yoda and Duku.  Although, I would have liked it to be longer, I think it was GREAT to see Yoda in action.  The third good thing about this movie was that it made the plot in Episode I at least marginally understandable.  And the fourth change was the ditching of the whole midiclorian thing.  This was another of Lucas' worst decisions. ",0.19970760233918128,0.5722222222222222

I see they could not resist making a large number of the Jedi knights female, I guess to make certain little girls would also buy toy light sabers but it did not have a major impact on the credibility.

"The second part of the prequels trilogy of Star Wars looked to me, in the first two acts, as a boring movie, but not THAT boring. The romance between Anakin and Padmé was not well written by George Lucas, who's not helped that much delivering some bad dialogues, as the classic ""I don't like sand"", and the acting of Hayden makes it everything worse, but it's not his fault, looks hard to act out from the dialogues he have. The plot of Kenobi tracking down Jango Fett is okay, nothing special, nothing really that interesting, the designs of Kamino and Geonosis are... meh, but the character of Jango Fett is fine and that's all. The real magic happens in the third act. Count Dooku, who Christopher Lee plays perfectly, the return of the Trade Federation, and the plans of the Separatists are revelead then. The Battle of Geonosis is great, and I don't really minded at all the outdated CGI, but what really made it everything even better was the battle of Count Dooku vs Kenobi and Anakin, and later on Dooku vs Yoda.

"Ten years after The Phantom Menace, Anakin Skywalker is the rambunctious apprentice to Obi- Wan Kenobi. The two of them confront Padme after several years as they are informed that several assassination attempts occurred trying to claim her life. As Anakin is assigned to protect Padme, the two of them are shipped off to Naboo while Obi-Wan tries to track down the ones responsible, leading him to Kamino where a massive clone army is being built. Meanwhile, Anakin continues having nightmares about his mother and heads to Tatooine to save her, meeting his step brother Owen Lars and his step father Cliegg Lars, who informs him that she was abducted by Tusken Raiders. Going to the Tusken Raider village, he talks to his mom for the first time in a long time, just before she dies, sending Anakin in a rage and causing him to massacre the entire village. At the same time, Obi-Wan is lead to Geonosis where he discovers that the wicked Count Dooku is behind the attacks on Padme's life. As Obi-Wan is captured, Anakin and Padme go to rescue him, unwillingly getting thrust into the battle droid manufacturing plant.They too are eventually captured by Dooku's enforcer, Jango Fett (Boba Fett's daddy-o) and are to be executed at the mouths of several wild Genosian creatures. Eventually, the jedi arrive and take on the incoming battle droids, then Yoda comes with the Clone Army, then Anakin and Obi-Wan take on Dooku, then Anakin gets his arm cut off, then Yoda comes in to kick Dooku's tush, then Anakin and Padme get married, then the Clone Wars begin.",-0.0065972222222222265,0.32638888888888895
"Despite the notion that any deliberation around 'Star Wars has the ability to start World War III, I highly doubt that this take will be the most incendiary yet. Thanks to a good friend of mine, I've been sharing a Disney+ account to see some of the hottest content on there that pertains to me. Before I dive into 'The Mandalorian' and eventually the everlong 'Clone Wars' series, I'll be rewatching some of the feature films to cement my ranking of the 'Skywalker Saga' (my top 4 and bottom 2-3 are rigged in place). So why not start off with a bang and say that I've come back around to reliking 'Attack of the Clones'? Although 'Revenge of the Sith' and to some extent the whole prequel trilogy hold a place of nostalgia for many, the only one that I believe touches the sky is of course, 'Revenge of the Sith'. 'The Phantom Menace', while not awful, remains a tedious watch due to its slog handling of the political storylines, a bulk of its plot being an uninteresting slow burn that merely provides some building blocks for the future episodes. 'Episode II' thankfully provides a lot of payoff as its own contained chapter before 'Episode III', and it's far more engaging and interesting despite being clumsy at times.",0.16522727272727275,0.5381818181818182

The slick asthetic and cool new characters give this movie a feel that stands apart in the saga. The lightsaber duels are also very visually satisfying most of the time. However, the acting and dialogue especially toward the middle of the film is just so poor it holds back what is really a pretty good intro and conclusion. Thankfully, the cringey romance is inter-cut with a really intriguing mystery aspect to the plot so the pacing doesn't suffer too much. That being said the really poor dialogue in the romance embodies what certain critics hate about the prequels and really holds back the rest of the movie (which is really quite good) from being one of the really good star wars films. However, everything else about this movie is honestly great. Count Dooku is meanacing. The Jengo hunt is intriguing as heck. And the finale is the colosseum is one of my favorite star wars scenes.

"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is the second installment in the prequel trilogy of the Star Wars Saga, released back in 2002. Set ten years after Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is the apprentice to Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), the former apprentice of Qui-Gon Jinn, Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), the former Queen of Naboo, is now a Senator of the Galactic Republic, and Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. In this episode, Anakin and Obi-Wan are commissioned by the Jedi Council to protect Senator Amidala from an assassination plot. In the process, Obi-Wan is sent to the mysterious world of Kamino, where he will learn of the Grand Army of the Republic that will assist the Jedi in the Battle of Geonosis and encounter the dangerous bounty hunter Jango Fett and his son, Boba; Anakin must go with Padme to Naboo as her protector and, eventually, they end up falling in love, something that is forbidden for Anakin. Like I stated in my review for Episode I, once again, Episode II did everything it was supposed to: introduce us to the Clone Troopers (who will eventually become the Storm Troopers), reveal the epic beginning of the Clone Wars, and show Jedi Master Yoda in action vs Count Dooku (Christopher Lee)!!! I'll say this though, the thing that I don't like about this episode is that there is no real action until Obi-Wan engages in combat with Jango Fett. The love story really slows things down. Other than that, Episode II was pretty enjoyable. John Williams' ""Across the Stars"" was a great theme for the movie. That was probably the one thing that kept me interested the first half of this movie when I saw this in theaters.

"George Lucas was influenced by Flash Gordon serials when he was a little kid. And this movie (and the title also) is am homage to those cheesy and cheaply serials.

The Star Wars movie for the new generation of fans, is good even in the making of the poster., with such a simple design and effective results.

"Star Wars Episode 2: The Attack of the Clones is brilliantly filmed with special effects filling every scene, ultimately adding a sense of fast-paced adventure and franticness. The last forty-five minutes of the production includes an extremely breathtaking war between good and bad, leading to an awesome fight between Yoda and Count Dooku What I have exemplified in the first two sentences, are the positive aspects of this film: The special effects, and the last forty five minutes. Unfortunately, the negative points (in my opinion) are quite noticeable. The acting is not as effective as it could be, and is inspired by a stilted script which contains only some potential humor and zero possible romance. The love story is too rash and somehow wrong even though Portman and Christensen are apparently good actors. Ewan McGregor is okay as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but could add more emotion into his role. What I thought to have been a big improvement however (which other people savoring the older trilogy may disagree with) is the CGI version of Yoda. He looks less funny than how he did as a complex puppet and has many more kid fans now. Therefore, this second prequel to ""Star Wars"" does have many things to offer, just don't depend on impeccable dialogue and breath-taking amour to decide your satisfaction.",0.21904452690166976,0.5784755720470005

For the first time since the Empire Strikes Back the trilogy really focused on the mysteries of the Force and really gave viewers a gutsy well written story. I have read critics who have lambasted the movie as having campy dialogue and less than stellar acting. I am a regular movie goer and know the original trilogy by heart and if the reviewers that were critical of this movie had actually watched the movie as a continuation of the same story or a preface to the original series, those reviewers would see that this movie comes much closer to the vision of the earlier movies. Lets face it folks, when it comes time for the Academy Awards, the Star Wars movies win on technical merit as well as musical accompaniament.

"After The Phantom Menace was a massive disappointment, Fans hoped that Attack Of The Clones would be an improvement. First the positives, The performances by McGregor, Lee, and Jackson are great, Some visuals are cool, Jar-Jar is barley in it, The Lightsaber duels are still fun, and the Clones are fairly interesting. Unfortunately, Attack Of The Clones is actually worse than The Phantom Menace with a performance from Hayden Christensen that is Twilight levels of bad (I don't blame the actor, I blame Lucas's script), The dialogue is more wooden here, The romance between Anakin and Padame is poorly executed and cringeworthy, And the CGI is overused to death with some noticeable green screen. Overall, Attack Of The Clones is the worst Star Wars film to date.",-0.06874999999999999,0.53125
"Attack Of The Clones is a film which relies to much on special effects and not enough on dialogue and overall enjoyabilty.

While the original Star Wars Trilogy used modelling and puppet techniques, Attack Of The Clones relies to much on computer effects. Far too much blue screen work. Don't get me wrong, the blue screen is good in small doses. IN SMALL DOSES. But 90% of what we see on the screen are computer effects.",0.08516483516483517,0.4824175824175825

"The second entry in George Lucas' new Star Wars trilogy rises above it's predecessor with better dialogue, less Jar Jar, a spry Yoda, and overacting good enough to make Hayden Christenson the perfect father of Mark Hamill. While this movie, which shows Anakin's resentful tendencies and introduces the clone army that will dethrone the Republic, is better than the mediocre Phantom Menace, it does not even reach Return of the Jedi standards. While the writing is better in this entry, the love story between Padme and Anakin is so painfully dumb and childish that it almost destroys the other improvements. The biggest problem continues to be the lack of a villain to match Vader and the utter predictability of it all. Yoda becomes the star when he starts doing summer salts and makes Dooku tuck tail. Why wasn't that in Episode One? If George Lucas can make Episode III as much of an improvement over Episode II, as Episode II is over Episode I, fans may finally get the ride that they have been waiting twenty-two years to experience.",0.14831649831649832,0.5386784511784511
"I grew up watching this movie on VHS along with the Phantom Menace when I was young, but for no particular reason I peg it as my least favorite. I big Star Wars fan, and what makes me a fan is that I like the movies, seriously most Star Wars fans hate Star Wars.
As I got older I think I prefer it to The Phantom Menace and Solo.
The worst aspect of the movie is the romance between Anakin and Padmé it is poorly written and badly acted, mostly be Hayden Chrsitianson. But I have come to enjoy it over the years at the pure stupidity of the dialogue. I think the basic outline of the story of Anakin being the protector and them getting drawn into a larger adventure is not the problem and if it was executed well could have been a better part of the movie.
Though the best quality of the movie is the action. The speeder chase, the fight between Obi wan and Jango Fett, and the entire battle of Geonosis. All of these are superior to the Pod Racing scene and the duel of fates sequence.
Both the deception of the Emperor and failure of the council, display the intriguing politics of the world of the late republic.
Another positive is the first steps toward his decent to the dark side. Ewan McGreggor as Obi Wan is one of the greatest parts of the trilogy as a whole.
But the main reason I am draw to it is that it is Star Wars and that is usually just enough for me to nerd out and pick up on the small nerdy details and will push the movie over the edge of being great.",0.058988380041011625,0.49900318979266345
"Because it's Star Wars, I think viewers don't see this as just another movie, but tend to micro-analyze everything. Since I don't really care that much about Star Wars, compared to something more serious such as 'Shadowlands' or any one of a hundred other movies, I think this movie comes off really well. It's gorgeous to watch, especially the imaginative scenic renderings of the different planets. The acting is quite credible, the storyline has way more dramatic tension than you'd normally expect in sci-fi, and there's an ominous brooding presence I find quite amenable to our lives and the times.

Fans will know this signals the beginning of the Clone Wars, and the end of the Republic. I appreciate the film's darker tone.

"I think people are overly harsh concerning these movies. A lot of people complain about the use of CGI vs. modeling in the original trilogy, but this is a bunch of bull. If Lucas had the capability to use CGI in the first trilogy, he definitely would have used it. The only reason that he didn't use it was that he couldn't, so instead he spent an inordinate amount of time creating set pieces and large-scale miniatures of ships (Milennium Falcon, X-Wings, Tie Fighters, Star Destroyers, the Death Star). This must have cost an absolute fortune, not to mention that the manpower effort to realize his visions must have been staggering. And while I agree that the use of models has allowed those movies to stand up to the test of time (I recently watched the trilogy on DVD for the first time in years), I still think there is a lot of good stuff in this installment. The CGI is amazing, particularly the sequence showing the rescue of Anakin, Obi Wan and Amidala on Tatooine. I thought Yoda's fighting sequence was well-done (he's the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy - why is this so unbelievable?) And the chase with Obi Wan and Anakin trailing the would be assassin through the skyways makes the similar scene in the 5th element look like a coarse little flip-book (a movie which has a higher score on this site). The acting was a deterrent - especially in depicting the love story of Padme and Anakin. Gone is Liam Neeson, but added was Christopher Lee, a favorite of mine. Unfortunately this incarnation of Anakin is highly annoying, much more so than the boy from Ep. 1. I simply could not accept that Amidala would fall in love with this immature, arrogant little punk for a second. Still, I give the movie an 8. People's expectations are way too high for these movies, mostly because of the phenomenon the original series spawned. I think it is unfair to judge these movies in this way, but rather to take them as they are without trying to constantly compare them to the originals. The originals are obviously superior, without doubt; however the originals are also some of the greatest movies ever made, and to expect the same this time around is unfair; it is difficult to catch lightning in a bottle once, let alone 6 times - Lucas managed to do it 3 times with the original movies, and while these are not on the same level, they are enjoyable nonetheless. 7 of 10",0.1128148148148148,0.5884550264550265

Star Wars: Episode 2 - Attack of the Clones,0.0,0.0
"I did not think it is possible, but George Lucas has somehow excreted a sequel that manages to make the lameness of The Phantom Menace look like high art. At this point, it seems very clear that Lucas, irate that fans have pigeon-holed him into a niche as the auteur responsible for adventures in a galaxy far, far away, are going to seriously pay for it. And what better way than for Lucas to simply take a dump all over the opening trilogy that he has promised to provide for years? Attack of the Clones becomes the latest casualty of Lucas' incompetent writing and direction resulting in a much-awaited sequel that viewers hoped would improve on the problems of its predecessor, but instead finds entirely new ways to exploit and exacerbate them. The plot – such as it is – picks up roughly 10 years after the last film. Anakin Skywalker is now a strapping young man and acolyte of Jedi Master Ben Kenobi, who gets assigned as a glorified bodyguard to former Queen Amidala (now Senator Amidala), while Kenobi goes off in search of the supposed clone army of the title. There are a number of plot holes and inconsistencies as well as developments that simply fail to effectively dovetail with what viewers already know from the original trilogy. For instance, there is nothing especially heroic or admirable about the Jedi Knights as depicted in this film. They seem to be a suspiciously virginal monastic order with particular disdain for both emotions and outsiders – and they are almost laughably incompetent. They are constantly taken by surprise by enemies in their midst and most action scenes will be marked by a stretch where the Jedi participating will somehow lose their lightsabre during the battle. Yet their dialog – especially that as delivered by Samuel L. Jackson and the increasingly tiresome Yoda – is delivered with a smug self-righteousness that crosses the border of hypocrisy into arrogance. Also interesting is that Lucas fails to give us any reason as to why Amidala would be a target of assassination attempts since she brings nothing conceivable to the table to be a threat to anyone. It all functions as little more than a plot contrivance to throw Anakin and Amidala together for Lucas' ham-fisted idea of a romance. As though suddenly realizing that he needs to maneuver the future parents of Luke and Leia together, Lucas conspires painful passages awkwardly inserted into the story where we are supposed to see their relationship developing to a point where both parties buck the rules to become married. The film also continues to suffer from the lack of a good villain. Christopher Lee shows up late in the game as a sinister character called Count Dooku, but it impossible to tell in the mishmash of a story whether his goals are ultimately good or bad. Would that the attention Lucas has lavished on his overabundance of phony-looking CGI effects had been aimed at the story. C-3PO and R2-D2 are back, but used badly – especially in a concluding conveyor belt action scene that results in C-3PO's head being placed on an attack droid's body with assorted crummy one-liners in accompaniment. The various alien cultures that Lucas presents are not remotely imaginative and saddled with notable stereotypical English dialects. Ewan McGregor holds himself with a bit of dignity as Ben Kenobi, so it is a shame that Lucas has yet to write him a good role. Samuel L. Jackson's macho tough guy shtick is past its shelf life. Natalie Portman seems to become increasingly more catatonic as Amidala (her scene after falling out of a copter is high unintentional comedy). Poor Hayden Christensen has it the worst. He is stuck with the impossibly daunting task of eliciting audience sympathy for an anti-hero whose character arc is already known to the audience, trying to convince us that he is hopelessly enchanted with his wooden leading lady, and that he actually has a degree of mentor/student chemistry with McGregor, all while being saddled with bargain basement dialog that makes the central character seem little more than a shallow, petulant brat. He manages a couple of nice moments where he hints of the darkness to come, but is largely crushed by the Lucas ball of ineptitude. In the director chair, Lucas seems to have no idea how to generate suspense or pace the film in an effective manner. In fact, it often seems that the film functions as barely more than a showcase for his CGI effects studio. A dismal wreck that truly has completely derailed what should have been a far more promising and durable series.",0.018130018130018126,0.5454917304917306

In the originals, (and sequels), lightsabers were treats for the audience. Here, the tradition was broken hardest, in having the sheer volume of them on-screen at once.
The film also lacks any stand out moment, that all the other films have: Maul and pod racing from TPM; the transformation scene in ROTS; the trench run in ANH; Vader's reveal in ESB; the duel in ROTJ; Han's death in TFA; and Luke's death in TLJ.

Now on to my review:  George Lucas has done it again!  This is his crowning achievement so far, and it's only gonna get better!  I know a lot of people didn't like the acting or the dialogue, but to the fans this was beyond a masterpiece.  This movie far surpasses everything in the previous trilogy with sound and visuals.  Granted, George Lucas sticks to a certain formula, but if the shoe fits... I feel that the acting in the movie was not as bad as most have said, and the dialogue is standard Star Wars.  There is no way around it.  George Lucas has his method of doing things and he's not gonna change.  For every Star Wars fan that thought this movie was bad look at it this way: My wife is ABSOLUTELY NOT a Star Wars fan, but she liked this one!

"A long time ago, in a galaxy not a million miles away from our own, Geroge Lucas made 'Star Wars'. Optimisitcally subtitled 'A New Hope', the film was an old fashioned, good-versus evil, rollicking adventure, with a cracking storyline and groundbreaking special effects. The huge success of the movie is widely believed today to have had a massive impact on Hollywood as a whole; but in a more local context, a direct consequence was the release of two sequels (though Lucas left the direction of these to others). Sequel number one, 'The Empire Strikes Back', added a layer of darkness to the story, but also a layer of pretension, and the episodic plot seemed to do little more than occupy the space between the first film and the third. And by the time of number three ('The Return of the Jedi'), it appeared that the concept was running out of steam; although still a huge box-office success, nothing new was offered to the audience except the abominably cuddly Ewoks. Even more worrying was that Lucas seemed prouder of the Ewoks than he was of the movie, and he was to spend some effort in the subsequent years attempting to promote them as the future of family entertainment. 'Star Wars', however, was placed firmly on the back-burner, and vaguely mentioned plans for three promised ""prequels"" appeared to be buried.",0.09794179035250462,0.41031617192331493

"I had heard that Episode II was better than the Phantom Menace and I will agree with that appraisal. Unfortunately that is not saying a whole heck of a lot. The first three Star Wars movies were awesome and each one carried it's weight. It is hard to beat perfection and I am afraid that it shows in both of the prequels. I found the acting extremely wooden and uninspiring. I am not a huge fan of the casting in the first place and that is even more obvious in this film. Jimmy Smits?? What the heck were they thinking??!! Samuel Jackson is bad enough. Thankfully they went light on Jar Jar Binks but in all honesty any scene with this annoying character is enough to make one beg for mercy. I was hoping that Jar Jar would meet his end but you will have to see for yourself. I found most of this film slow moving and uninspiring. When you find yourself looking at your watch all the time this is not a good sign! I will admit that the last 20 minutes of the film are very well done. But when a movie has two hours preceeding that said 20 minutes, you get the picture. Don't get me wrong, I love Star Wars but at this point I am wishing George Lucas had only made three films, and left the rest in his imagination. One can only watch so many scenes with strange creatures and space ships and computer generated imagery and this is getting to the point of overkill. I could easily tell what was ""real"" and what was CGI and even Matte paintings. All in all I found the movie a real bore and would not recommend it to anyone. For real action and adventure try SpiderMan or The Scorpion King. Attack of the Clones should have been called Attack of the Drones!",0.04240196078431372,0.5227941176470586

Howard Stern said it best in his complaint ""It doesn't go anywhere"" well it's not really suppose to really go anywhere it's the second part in the Prequels and second part of the saga. The story evolves the saga into the teenage mood swings of Anakin, his evil and good events along with his lack of control. We also grow into Obi-Wan Kenobi as a more mature teacher struggling to pass on idea's of his old mentor while his student is recklessly pushing him away. There's Padme who is in a life crises, falls in love with a past hero, even though he is bad news and very obsessive. Then there is Y-O-D-A, in need not say more.

"(3/10) Star Wars II was predictably bad. The special effects were up to the high standard of the original and it was visually very nice, but George Lucas can't write scripts for toffee. Looking at the bio for co-scriptwriter Jonathan Hales - a string of made-for-TV spin-offs and the Scorpion King - one gathers he wasn't much help either - sadly we are to be sentenced to more of this collaboration on SWIII. Perhaps Ewan McGregor will have invested some of his relatively new found wealth in acting lessons by the time shooting begins in 2003? (He left London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama before even graduating). McGregor's boy-next-door Scottish charm is ok to land some nice juicy parts but I would like to see him play someone other than McGregor now he's got them. I can barely distinguish the ""lovable"" McGregor in Moulin Rouge from the vocally-challenged McGregor in Black Hawk Down or the now-I-get-to-play-a-super-hero McGregor in  Clones Attack.

"Honestly this movie is a lot of issues. Sure it has some good parts and stuff, which put at 8th place above phantom menace, but even then that's barely. Let's start off with that the very first part of the film is forgettable because of the senate scenes. I will go back to this later, but for now the the underworld plot thread. It's not that great, it's basically okay on concept and paper, but it's not good in execution because it's so under developed and like it's there but just disappears into another plot. I wished it was explored more. My next point is about the character. It's not that great in individual scenes but in the entire movie it's alright which in itself is bad. Honestly the whole this plot thread and character development connects to the whole problem with the prequels is George sort of forces the world building. We already got the world building in the original trilogy so I don't we need a world building like this but if he wanted to he could've had some of movies feel connected. Which also brings up the concept point that everybody Hass which is that George it's got a concept but bad at execution which is totally true. Now on to the senate scenes. Wow these scenes just so cringe/boring that it really takes away from the underworld plot thread and. The scenes basically just throw politics at you instead of having breaks that really make since and make you invested with the politics. George should've know better. My next point is about the love scenes, they are so cringe. It's basically toxic high school love mixed with childish love as well (I mean high school love is childish whatever). Honestly George should've not forced it at all. This brings me to how he handles anakin. Anakin is very annoyed at the stuff the Jedi council and obi wan do, but it's not really that great and what would've worked us flashbacks that would've gave us skywalkers pad wan years before atoc to see why he is this way. Also could've had padme be like more in a say in stuff anakin talks (yes she sort of dose to an extent which brings me to my next point). I feel padme is a little bit better than phantom menace padme. A lot of people probably disagree with me on this, but I think the acting that natalie Portman has is good, yes it's dry, but it's a little bit better than anakin. It's probably because of George's why of handling dialogue. I think that there should've been flashbacks of qui-gon and dooku sprinkled in in the movie, but mainly have in it in the duel at the end with dooku vs anakin obi wan and yoda, which brings me to my next point, the duel. This duel has a problem it has no good breathing room when dooku, obi wan, and anakin fight expect for maybe yoda vs dooku but still has some bad breathing room. All I think they could've done is have obi wan fight dooku first than have anakin fight next so that we can have a flashback about dooku and qui-gon. Maybe have it in yoda vs dooku as well, which brings me to my next problem, which is the ending of yoda and dookus duel. It felt very rushed and like dooku just run away like a coward which he is sort of a coward but that's not the point. The point is they could've had dooku be like you will see your downfall soon Jedi or something like that just keep the Jedi at edge. Another problem is there's not enough bad guy scenes. All I wanted was more scenes with the bad guys but where we get spoiled of order 66. Honestly that's all of my complaints and stuff. Why I put this above phantom menace is because of the end battle, kamino/clones, and the sith plot. There's one thing I would've is more tension between obi wan and jango but that's it. I think 7 is a fair score since it's still a good Star Wars but had so massive flaws.",0.12323717948717945,0.46813746438746434

That's nothing really new with the ""Star Wars""-movies, but it's sad in this case, where beauty and greatness could have been easy to achieve. Part of the reason for that is the shallowness of Hayden Christensen, who doesn't have enough to offer in order to let us believe he's suffering - let alone the ability of sharing his turmoil.

At some points it seems that he can't remember how to direct real actors either, so caught up as he is in the digital revolution.

Lucas clearly set out to impress the fans by including R2-D2 and C3PO in much bigger roles even though this throws up huge plot holes like why do none of the characters from the original trilogy remember encountering these droids who help them save the universe, it appears Lucas doesn't realize that you can't make a prequel unless it makes sense of the original in the same way you can't have a sequel that doesn't make sense of the film it follows on from.

"Writer & director George Lucas takes more chances in ""Star Wars: Episode Two: Attack of the Clones"" than he has since his first sequel ""The Empire Strikes Back"" in 1980. The second prequel in the popular Twentieth Century Fox film franchise surpasses the adolescent antics of ""Episode One,"" but defies expectations. First, Lucas and co-scenarist Jonathan Hales of ""The Scorpion King"" weave a darker, thematically richer, far more elaborate tale of deception and intrigue. Second, the stormy relationships between Jedi wannabe Anakin Skywalker (newcomer Hayden Christensen whose striking resemblance to James Dean adds to his stature), his Jedi mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor of ""Trainspotting""), and Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman of ""The Professional"") lack both the usual charisma and warmth. Third, while some ""Star Wars"" fans may rank ""Episode One"" above ""Episode Two,"" the latter neither panders to instant gratification nor glib evasions of moral obligations as in ""Spider-man."" New characters bristle with greater ambiguity, and a serviceable storyline contains enough surprises. For the record, ""Episode Two"" occurs ten years after ""Episode One."" During that decade, Obi-Wan has instructed hot-tempered Anakin in the ways of a Jedi knight. Senator Amidala, previously the Queen of Naboo, lands on the planet Coruscant to address the Republic about the political unrest in the galaxy. Predictably, assassins line up to kill Amidala. Jedi Master Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Fresh"") appoints Obi-Wan and Anakin to serve as her bodyguards. Basically, ""Episode Two"" begins as a mystery thriller, and then chronicles Anakin's forbidden romance with Amidala on Naboo and his tragic descent to the Dark Side.",0.06619644723092998,0.40360501567398116

At first I thought the lines spoken by Anakin and Padmé, when they were alone, were very un-original, but after having seen the scenes three times, I realized that it's Hayden's rather poor acting skills that's off. Don't get me wrong; I like him, and I think he's right for the part, but those lines could've been read with a LOT more credibility than that. He's sounds like he's late for date or something.

"Saying that this movie is an improvement over the Phantom Menace really isn't saying anything since this movie is still awful! I still hate it but it is a little bit better. This movie actually had a lot more potential than most people give it credit for. A clone army battle, a Jedi protecting Padme from being assassinated, tracking down a bounty hunter who ends up being the father of Boba Fett (and it made a great story arc in Clone Wars!) This is some cool stuff! However, it's all destroyed by the one major thing this movie focuses on: The romance between Anakin and Padme. I was against this from the start because in the Phantom Menace, Padme was a queen. Yes, she was a young queen but she had to have been at least 14 or 15 to be elected. We also know that Anakin was around 8 or 9 in the last movie. That's at least 5 years apart! There's also the fact that I really don't like either of the characters. I really don't care for Padme. While she is strong in the final battle, Padme spends the rest of the movie either being creepily flirtatious or resisting Anakin. It kind of gets annoying after a while is all I'm saying. I would later feel bad for her in Revenge of the Sith after Anakin broke her heart but she's annoying here. Speaking of Anakin, when he's not Darth Vader, he is the most bratty, obnoxious, whiny baby in Star Wars history. Maybe even cinema history! With the exception of The Clone Wars (2008-2014) I hate Anakin in everything prequel related. Example: In this movie, Anakin's mother dies. Go figure! So what is his response? Schlaughter all the the Tusken Raiders of course! Okay, I get murdering the one/ones responsible for killing your mother but the women and children had nothing to do with her death! Also, get over yourself. You knew it wasn't going to be all sunshine and rainbows for her after you left Tatooine FOUR YEARS AGO! God! The romance here is also way too dumb and stupid to actually believe. Not to mention that the dialogue between them in just cringe-inducing and not even in a good way! I know this is a persistent problem throughout the movie but it mostly comes from the scenes with Anakin and Padme.

Star Wars is the very first movie I saw in a theater when it was released in 1977. The movie is really my first cinematic experience and since then I am a Star Wars fan. The movie became mythical with the Empire strikes back (1980) and the Return of the Jedi (1983). But then the myth was not resurrected with The Phantom Menace.

While it isn't as much of a mess as Episode 1 was, Episode 2 makes several missteps that are disappointing, but not offensive. The primary mistake is that Lucas got carried away with wanting more spectacle. He makes some beautiful shots. He knows how to frame things, how to make individual shots very memorable. And that's great, but the movie is packed with those, at the expense of making a movie that will stand up to repeated viewings without getting boring. The plot feels needlessly complex for a story that should be easy to summarize in a single paragraph. But each step of the story includes sequences that slather icing all over the cake that is Star Wars. Chasing Zam Wessel through Coruscant? Yes, it's technically impressive, but it feels pretty boring. It takes up too much time, cut with some very tacky dialogue, to get us to the nightclub.

Padmé's my favourite character! you may say its my opinion, true, but the Star Wars saga are the best films to hit the big screen. Very well done.",0.440410052910053,0.5242063492063492

"I'm still deciding whether Attack of the Clones is the best Star Wars movie or the second best.  All sentimentality aside, this movie literally took my breath away, something A New Hope never did.  Before last night my favourite SW film was The Empire Strikes Back, then ANH, Return of the Jedi and finally, Episode I.  Episode II fits either at the start or just after Empire.  I read a few reviews before seeing the film and noted that critics tend to expect any film to be perfect in every way.  Comments like ""terrible scripting"" and ""bad acting"" seem to be thrown around often but I'm sure if ANH was released today it would get just as bad reviews, maybe worse.  In one line Attack of the Clones is as good as The Phantom Menace was bad. The special effects were freaky good and only one or two CG shots (out of hundreds) looked a tad fake.  The rest is worthy of an Academy Award (although it may be forgotten by then).  The sound was equally amazing from the seat rocking explosions to the bustling city of Coruscant to the quite waters of Naboo.  I was especially impressed with the re-introduction of some of the old favourites (read: lasers).  The score was fantastic and added so much to the film, plus picking up on the little themes from the original trilogy (Emperial March etc) weaved into the new score was a delight.  The final shot was almost identical to the final shot in Empire Strikes Back except this time we have Anakin and Padme standing arm in arm while C3PO and R2D2 look on.

There is a tremendous final battle scene, a bit over long and over done. No 'travel time' is depicted anywhere in the movie, so we in effect have people traveling many, many light-year distances in a very short time. Plus, when they communicate over very great distances, it is virtually instantaneous like a cell phone call. I suppose they figured out how to greatly speed up light speed.

"The hype surrounding Attack of the clones, not even came near to the hype that surrounded The Phantom Menace three years ago. The biggest contributors to that, were of course the fact that The Phantom Menace did not live up to people's expectations as being the best film ever made and that it has not been 16 years since the last Star Wars film, but only three. These two factors also contributed to Attack of the Clones fairing much worse than The Phantom Menace at the box office (the huge success of Spider-Man being a third factor). Despite a lot of good reviews, many people were not to excited to see this film and critics (again) did not appreciate the effort. They described Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Anakin as bad and the evolving relationship between him and Senator Amidala (Natalie Portman) was laughable. I tried not to be hasty on my comment and went to see this film twice, before making my final judgment. I did that, because I had learned from the mistake I made with The Phantom Menace. I would have loved to change my review of that film after I had seen it for the second time on the big screen, because I realized, that if I wanted to comment on a film so loaded with effects, the only way I could do every aspect of the film justice was to see it twice (the remainder of my thoughts on Episode I, are to be found in my Episode IV review).",0.12667464114832538,0.5359649122807019

"Attack of the Clones is a more boring version of The Phantom Menace with a considerably better ending. The movie revolves around Anakin's character, which is a real shame because he's one of the weakest points of the movie. He's a young padawan with considerable potential but is also an angsty hormonal teenager. We don't get any legitimate character traits during the movie, just obsession with Padme because she's pretty and a couple ham-fisted lines about how he's actually pretty into dictatorship. Subtle. There's no development or multi-dimensionality to his character, and his relationship with Padme couldn't be more dull or predictable. I honestly don't even know if Christensen gives a bad performance, because the cheesy and underwritten script he's given does seem to portray him as a dull angsty teenager, so if that was Lucas' vision, Christensen killed it. Portman as Padme, on the other hand, was a frustratingly flat performance where the script did give her more room for emotional variance and development. She's one of my favorite actresses of all time and her performance in Black Swan is still my favorite performance of all time, but after giving her a pass in The Phantom Menace because she's undercover, her flat line delivery and lack of physicality was a letdown. She doesn't sell the internal struggle of what to do with Anakin, doesn't really sell either the pretending to not like him or actually being in love at the end, and doesn't sell being a relevant senator. Love Portman, frustrated by her performance especially given how she could've elevated many of the dull parts of the movie.",0.04861111111111112,0.5562499999999999

Hayden Christensen, while he had just a few exaggerated lines, was awesome as the troubled teenage Anakin that soon becomes the legendary Darth Vader.

My favorite scenes are when Jango Fett and Obi-Wan fight, when Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padme' are in the arena fighting the monsters, the part when Jango Fett and Obi-Wan are trying to kill each other in the asteroid belt, Yoda's fight with Darth Tyranus, and the climax.

"The special effects were wonderful in this movie.   The story was easier to follow than the first episode and the new aliens and diverse worlds were great to experience.   The love story bits were something else.  If Annette Funicello had a cameo during the sappy love story bits I wouldn't have been surprised.   Hayden Christensen was a petulant, immature, ill-mannered little boy.  He had no appeal or believability as a Jedi.  I can't see how he would have lasted through any kind of rigorous training.  Natalie Portman was more appealing and though she was believable as a Queen she seemed too young to be a senator.  She was good in the movie, attractive and appealing. Hayden Christensen seemed much more appealing in the DVD extra features than he did in the movie.  Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, and Ian McDiarmid were all good.  Dialog was typically clunky.  Someone should slowly ease George Lucas away from the typewriter after the general outline of the movie is finished and allow someone with some experience with real people and dialog polish the final version.  The movies succeed in spite of the characterizations not because of them.  It is the effects and the action that appeal.  The fight sequences are so full of detail that subsequent watching is just as enjoyable.  There is always FFWD for the love story.",0.34159160731741367,0.5454615277195923
"This movie was better than TPM, but still didn't quite make it to the level that most fans had expected. Again the story was great and the politics even more interwoven and subtle. George Lucas again shows he is a master at weaving a complex story while making it seem straight-forward. His directing even got a little better; still not great, but a lot better than before. The action was well done, though the lightsaber fighting wasn't quite as engrossing as in Episode I. A fight against CGI opponents doesn't look nearly as good as a fight against a live person, and most of the saber action was just that: the actor swinging at imagined enemies to be filled in later. Getting to see Yoda fight was a lot of fun, unfortunately too short. I did like the fact that after all of that twirling and spinning, he still pulled his cane to him to walk. It showed a great amount of discipline and respect for the Force that he only called on it when it was needed and didn't allow it to become a crutch (figuratively and literally). Yoda also looked far better in AotC than he did in TPM, one of the few times a CG character completely outdoes a ""real"" character (Yoda was a puppet in TPM). I was also hoping to see Anakin swinging two sabers for a bit longer (and Dooku picking up two as well, which is a scene they apparently cut from the film). I thought that Anakin was good, if a bit whiny; but then again, so was Luke in A New Hope Like father like son I guess. His speech about his love for Padme in the infamous ""Fireplace Scene"" while admittedly coming across as bad Goth Poetry did also seem rather chilling when you think about how intense his emotions are. The scene where he kills the Tusken Raiders then crying describes it later were very well done. It still suffers a bit from George's directing and not getting as good a performance as he could have from Hayden Christensen, but the moment for the character is wonderful in how it sets up the beginning of his fall to the Dark Side. The blossoming love between Anakin and Padme seemed a little rushed between ""Hey! I haven't seen you in 10 years!"" to ""Let's get married!"". And the ""I truly, deeply, love you."" line Padme gives Anakin as they are taken into the arena seemed really corny, but considering what it was supposed to portray I can be a bit forgiving. Count Dooku a.k.a. Darth Tyranus played by long time actor Christopher Lee was also very convincing as a political minded aggressor; but as a Dark Lord he seemed a bit weak. Political manoeuvrings and the fact that he had the plans for the Death Star in his pocket aside, he didn't have much else. If he hadn't gone over to ""Darth"" status and had still been in the beginning of his fall to evil it would have been a lot more in sync with his place in the story. He saw the corruption of the Senate and the stagnation of the Jedi; he tried to do something about it but was manipulated by Palpatine into falling to the Dark Side, not having enough willpower to stand up to him. Dooku is a very tragic character in the Star Wars saga, a man who wants to make the galaxy a better place, but winds up helping along the start of one of it's darkest times. In a way he is foreshadowing Anakin who will one day do the same thing, albeit on a much grander scale. Jango Fett was a pleasant surprise. New Zealand born Temuera Morrison brought a smart, calculating and menacing presence to the screen. He made you believe that this was a warrior who didn't fear the Jedi, no matter how powerful they could be. When he stood up to Obi-Wan when they first met you could tell the only thing he was worried about was being found out by the Law, he wasn't afraid of the Jedi. He proved it later when he defeated Obi-Wan on the landing platform, even if it was a close fight. Though like his son Boba in Return of the Jedi, he went out in a very quick manner that wasn't nearly as satisfying as you might have wanted for such a cool character. Mace Windu, the purple lightsaber wielding Jedi played by Samuel Jackson is supposed to be the best sword fighter in the Jedi order, and second overall to Yoda himself. Unfortunately all we really get to see him do is fight CG opponents, which doesn't do much to show his prowess. The only other things I found disappointing was the use of the reverberating sound effect. It was really overused, the ships made it, the speeders made it, even the animals made it. It was used so often that I lost my suspension of disbelief every time I heard it. C-3PO's constant barrage of puns didn't endear me to him much either. Lastly the ""do everything button"" that Amidala uses in the ship when they are about to leave Tatooine. It's a break in believable continuity as they zoom in showing her press it twice for two totally different functions; but it's not that big of a deal; just an annoyance. Overall though the movie was entertaining, a couple of great chase scenes and a great weaving plot that really progressed the characters and Palpatine's bid to rule the galaxy. It also seemed to redeem Lucas a bit in terms of Jar-Jar. When he falls for an amazingly transparent manipulation and calls the vote that will give full executive power to the Supreme Chancellor, he single-handedly puts the reigns of the government into Palpatine's hands. In other words we now have a story based reason to hate him. It's all Jar-Jar's fault. ;) 4 out of 5 stars.",0.12179753530199952,0.5199391877963309

Darth Sidious/Senator Palpatine should be made more obvious to the audience, because he isn't so obvious this movie doesn't stand so well alone as an independent movie, 4. for me personally I would have liked Anakin's hand in the end to have been completely covered by a black glove that would have been sweet I think. Despite these criticisms I still enjoyed this movie and I want to see it again before it leaves theaters this summer. As it stands I actually feel very sorry for Anakin and Padme. Anakin because he inherently is good but I know who and what is to become of him and for Padme because she is an innocent who tries to do the right thing and I believe she will pay a hefty price for it.

The story fits nicely with the way the Clone Wars begun and fitted into the already heard of history spoken of in the sequels. Ian McDiarmid was brilliant as the plotting Chancelor Palpatine, but a little more insight into his interference with Anakin's Jedi training would have made both characters so much more interesting. The droid war and the creation of a very stormtrooper look alike clone army to fight these droids was well done and set this up for a brilliant climax.

"What a crowd pleaser!!! George Lucas has returned STAR WARS to what it always should have been; inventive, and adventurous. This film far exceeds EPISODE I on many levels. The writing, and dialogue are far better - personally that was my biggest concern with PHANTOM... Also, there is less Jar Jar Binks, so audiences will be less anoyed by the childish antics of that very disliked Gungan. But the best part of EPII was clearly Yoda. Yoda has the largest role his character has ever had in a STAR WARS film, and although he has become a CGI character from a puppet, the people at ILM did a marvelous job in crafting him. The scene where Yoda has his own lightsaber battle with Count Dooku is pretty impressive, as well. For IMDB, I'd rate this film at 10 stars. If it were the normal film rating system, however, I would give it 4 stars; both equalling excellence. On another note, I did love PHANTOM MENACE. But I do think that Lucas sacrificed the integrity of plot, and dialgue for the visual aspects. Nontheless, I loved both films of the new STAR WARS Trilogy.",0.3110468319559229,0.6409641873278237

Episode I seems almost better now having seen this because it had to be fairly loose in plot to lay the foundations for what would follow. This episode really whets the appetite for Episode III, as so much will & must happen!  Bring it on!

"I walked into this movie expecting at best a couple hours of air-conditioned comfort, at worst another painfully dull experience as Phantom Menace turned out to be. Surprisingly, I was quite entertained. Much in this film harkened back to 'The Empire Strikes Back', in that it has texture, and even some dimension--along with incredibly improved visuals. The reviews are spot on in this regard; the movie is stunningly beautiful and feels 'real', unlike the video-game feel of 'Menace'. I'll say right now that the love story aspect was stillborn; in fact, nearly every scene featuring Padme and/or Anakin was as flat as a day-old beer. The digital performers out-acted them on every level (Jar-Jar aside--even his brief appearances were too much). Despite the overall clunkiness of the story, I felt something I thought wasn't possible with a Star Wars movie any more: involvement. (SPOILER: I especially enjoyed the return to Tatooine and the moisture farm, seeing Luke's future guardians as youths, in the familiar settings from the first movie. END SPOILER) While most of the dialogue was expectedly painful, there were a few chuckles, and C-3P0 has the best scenes he's ever had. The obligatory 'big battle' at the end was everything that the battle at the end of 'Menace' was not. I'm glad I gave in and saw this on the big screen.

What really kills the film, so much like the previous instalment, is the acting and dialogue. The story itself is once again completely adequate, but the execution of this is all over the place. The pairing of Anakin and Padmé could've been the most intriguing part of the film but it ends up just coming across as cringeworthy. The horrors Anakin is forced to bear with regard to his mother should've made for the best scenes of the entire film, but instead, just comes across as weightless and poorly performed. I have nothing against Hayden Christensen as an actor or a person, but I really don't feel he was right for the role. He tries very hard in all of his scenes but it ends up looking a bit over the top and cringeworthy. I don't blame him entirely however as George Lucas has shown with the Prequels and even parts of the Originals, that he simply isn't a gifted writer when it comes to dialogue.

"Yes, when the highlight of the film is an aged Christopher Lee battling a little green dude who really is not there the movie is just not a winner. Wisely, Lucas pulled back the usage of Jar Jar and replaced the young Anakin Skywalker with another actor. However, the movie is not much better than the last film and has way to many groan inducing scenes involving Anakin and Amidale who is now a senator as the planet she is from obviously has serious flaws in the way its government is structured. This one starts out with an assassination attempt on Amidale and great scenes like those Lucas ripped right out of the film ""The Fifth Element"" and had people selling death sticks (oh, what a clever jab at the tobacco trade). This film offers nothing new in the way of establishing a decent plot, other than the brief mention of the clone wars from the original Star Wars film. The guy they got to play Anakin was rather bad at his lines and was even stiffer than Ewan though I really think Ewan's main problem is that he did not want to really be in these films. We also get the origins of Bubba Fett as a guy who had less than ten minutes screen time in the original trilogy really needed a whole section of the movie dedicated to how he came about. Really this should show movie makers do not make scenes based on the fans wishes. Sure for some reason Bubba had his fans, but in the end his character was not important enough to merit this much attention. The only thing more stupid was making C-3PO a creation of Anakin even though he was a widely recognized protocol droid in the original series and adding Chewbacca for the heck of it in the final film in this rather badly written trilogy. There are scenes here and there that are good though (though not any scene where Anakin and Amidale are acting cutesy).

"I think that based on story, excitement and character development, this is one ranks the bottom out of all 6 of the Star Wars films. While the special effects and action were good, the character development wasn't there, and the story was rather boring. Here, Queen Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) is now a Senator representing her home planet of Naboo in the Galatic Republic. A faction of political separatists, led by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), wants to assassinate her. In the mist, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewen McGregor) continues to train Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christianson) to become a Jedi, but it is apparent that he would probably break the Jedi Code due to his growing love interest with Amidala. What results is poor screen comprehension between Skywalker and Amidala, and this film was drags on for too long to be focusing on the love interest between the two. This film also lacks the charm and excitement that the other films have. A few actions scenes were quite good, especially the one between Yoda and Count Dooku. The sceneries were also beautiful, especially the scenes of the Naboo palace - gorgeous landscape and cinematography. ",0.14511278195488722,0.5458646616541354

Acting is mediocre, dialogues succeed to provide the usual quantity of 'Star Wars' quotes without being at all natural, and even some of the effects are not that impressive - but what is impressive, now that we have seen 'Lord of the Rings'.

"It was no small task for George Lucas to make up for that ridiculous mess that bore the title of Episode I. While Episode II: Attack of the Clones was far from unflawed, it is vastly superior to its predecessor, providing for some serious entertainment and a huge relief for Star Wars fans around the world. Sadly, Star Wars has sank to the level at which many people are almost ashamed to like the new films anymore, an unfortunate fact which has come about solely as a result of Episode I, and the failure of Episode I is due in no small part to the abysmally moronic addition of a character like Jar Jar Binks, who is easily one of the most popularly hated characters ever put on screen. On the other hand, Episode II runs a strong campaign as the worst script of any Star Wars film which has ever been or (hopefully) ever WILL be made.",-0.04276515151515152,0.6606439393939394

Anakin is learning the ways of the Jedi from Obi-Wan and falls in love with Padme, and a sith named Count Dooku creates a separatist army to fight the Republic. Hayden Christensen steps into the role of Anakin Skywalker, and while he isn't the most experienced actor, i thought he did a good job of showing Anakin's innocence and his brushes with dark side. Ewan McGregor was the perfect choice to play a younger Obi-Wan, and he continues to prove it here, with just the right amount of smart-ass lines. The action scenes are pretty damn cool, too. Jango Fett's duel with Obi-wan on the ocean world is one of the cooler scenes, and the huge battle between the clones and the droids near the end is jaw-dropping.

Obi-wan especially (""I swear that boy'll be the death of me...""- oh god...), with Anakin's painfully bad 'romance' coming a close second. However, three key factors saved this: First, towards the second half, C-3PO and R2D2 make a return, some of the only real-ish characters from the first 3 films, to anchor this film back to the ground after so many of these goddam Jedi with their vaguely mystical and deeply tedious dialogue. Second, it's around this time when the story proper kicks in, which is well written, and lighter on dialogue.

Otherwise, the movie was excellent.  The battle sequences are as good as I have seen in a Sci-Fi movie, and the lead-in to Episode III is very good. Samuel L.

Part of the charm of the original film was that everything looked used and battered- almost nothing in the earlier films looked that way. Hayden , simply, was not up to the job and had zero chemistry with Natalie, though we were told that was the reason for casting them. Ewan McGregor whom I rate as an actor was limited by his need to channel Sir Alec. I have watched these prequels 3 times and find my mind wandering which never happened with the original films. Mind you none of those first three had Jar Jar Binks - a mistake of gargantuan dimensions which seemed impossible for a filmmaker of Lucas' experience to make.

In terms of action and story, I'd say it was an improvement over TPM. So that's a good thing. The lightsaber duel at the end was pretty cool. Though the one in TPM is still the best (until I see the ones in ROTS of course). Overall, I think it moved the story forward in a decent way. I don't really see Anakin as a pain as most people did. He is a teenager and pretty whiney so that's to be expected. I didn't like his choice of 'lines' to Padme though. I would be pretty afraid to use those lines on a chick :).

"Five movies in, and I think I've finally come to my definitive least favorite of the series. It's not bad, per say, just underwhelming, although it does have an better plot than The Phantom Menace. In Attack of the Clones, the Galactic Republic is on the brink of civil war when several planetary system threaten to secede under the leadership of rogue Jedi Count Dooku. An assassination attempt is made on Senator Padme Amidala, so Anakin Skywalker is tasked with protecting her, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi goes to investigate. Luckily, Episode II did deliver on my hope from Episode I in that the plot moves considerably forward, and some of the more notable characters are given more screen time (or less in Jar Jar's case, thank god). Padme and Anakin have a romantic subplot that I didn't mind, and Obi-Wan is always fun to watch, but I thought Anakin's character was much more interesting in this movie. There was quite a bit of foreshadowing of Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader that put the prequels into a better context and made Anakin more intriguing. It'd be nice if Hayden Christensen wasn't so awful in his role. Attack of the Clones does succumb to middle-chapter problems at times. There wasn't anything as memorable as the Darth Maul battle in The Phantom Menace or the speeder bike chase in Return of the Jedi.

Also, like Empire (unfortunately) no lead really shines as Alec and Liam did in other entries; Portman is very attractive but isn't quite charismatic enough to drive the story.

"Since May of 1977, when the original `Star Wars' premiered, George Lucas has been assembling the biggest cinematic jigsaw puzzle ever to hit the realm of fantasy and science fiction; a monumental undertaking that has forever altered the celluloid landscapes of the universe while propelling the art of filmmaking ahead at light speed.  His epic saga is the ultimate tale of Good against Evil-- pure in every sense--  and with the fifth installment, `Star Wars:  Episode II, Attack of the Clones,' Lucas carefully inserts more of the integral pieces into that puzzle, leading us ever closer to the full and complete picture that will be revealed in Episode III, the sixth and final chapter that will at last bring the story full circle.",0.1326190476190476,0.6144444444444446

Why couldn't we see a scene like this in the old Hammer films. Lee as you recall was first choice to play Darth Vader, but he turned it down.

"After watching the Phantom Menace, I thought Star Wars couldn't possibly get better. And yet, somehow it did. Hayden Christensen delivers gripping dialogue, superbly written. This film is a romance story above all else, and it absolutely NAILS IT. The romance between Anakin and Padme feels so real, and so pristinely written, I wondered how anyone believed the romance between Han Solo and Leia in the original trilogy at all.

First time THAT'S happened. The acting in this film is actually pretty lame. NO ONE stands out in this film. All the others had some great acting but not this one. Yoda didn't SOUND like Yoda. Sure they used the same guy to do the voice, but he didn't sound the same. Still, the film has bright spots in it and it serves to pique the interest in the next one. I just hope it's a little better than this one was. I probably won't buy this one. I may rent it again sometime.

And why haven't these brilliant Jedi Knights ever figured out that if they just put wrist-straps on their light sabers they won't drop them just out of reach every 15 seconds? Yes, the fight scenes and graphics were outstanding. Unfortunately, that's not enough to make a great film. Sorry George, but Elian Gonzales could have done a better job.

You wouldnt expect it from a 500+ year old impish green dwarf, would you?

"Suspend all of your ridiculous ""adult"" cynicism.  Think back to the original series.  Remember the suspenseful incredulity you felt while watching the most incredible spectacle you have ever seen on the big screen.  Remember the music, the sounds, the romance, the adventure, the bloody passion. It IS back.  As I watch this film for the second time (now on video), I realize that all of my criticism was due to nothing more than pathetic peer-like (decipher) expectations and 'grown-up-ism.'  This is the original series. You must watch this film with an un-altered eye.  You must watch this film with an open heart.  This is pure cinema.  Watch Anakin embrace his mother the same way in which Luke will embrace him years later.  Watch Anakin's reflection on Tatooine...notice something familiar?  Listen to the INCREDIBLE music written for the film (Williams must forever be remembered as a great composer).  EXPERIENCE the clone wars.  If you dare pretend that these are any less powerful than the battle on Endor, then I dare you to view Jedi again and compare it to the intense zoom-ins and dust clouds of these war scenes.  I must end this geekish tirade now as it is probably alienating all potential viewers of this film.  Just enjoy.",0.11479591836734694,0.5434523809523809

"Star wars episode 2 attack of the clones is not horrible. While I'll say that the dialogue is terrible and the love story is worthless, Other than that the story is pretty solid. The worst element of The Phantom Menace was the characters. I am happy to say they are much better in this. (Even though that's like saying a slingshot is more complicated than a rock). The character's in this movie can generate at least a bit of empathy. The acting in this movie is often criticized. I don't think this is fair. You have to remember that the dialogue is robotic and unrealistic that I doubt Malcolm McDowell could have pulled off Anakin, and George Lucas was directing these actors. Samuel .l was miscast and the rest of the actors had no real reason to be cast as their characters. The story in this is somewhat compelling and sometimes even interesting, which is a lot in the Star Wars Prequels. It revolves around Anakin having to protect Padme and Obi-wan having to find the person who ordered her assassination. The beginning is solid, the middle isn't horrible and the end is kind of exciting. The worst element of the movie is it's love story. There's been so much said about this I don't need to add anything, but I concur with those who say it is pointless, doesn't make sense, cliché and dumb. The special effects (which I estimate twenty times the amount of time was spent on than the script) are pretty great. It doesn't really look that real, but it does open a lot of possibilities, like the arena scene and the droid-clone battle. This about wraps it up. It's not The Godfather, but it's a nice, decent Star Wars movie. And Jake Lloyd is gone. Thank Christ.",0.040354090354090356,0.6041819291819294

Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones made me smile and get pumped up for the third one but then it mad me sick sometimes and it just made me wonder what happened. Now I liked the action a lot in this movie. I mean I've never had one complain over the action. The fights were neat and the battles were energetic. This movie was quite entertaining. It really didn't get you bored until the romance. Now the acting was horrific. Hayden Christensen should be fired. He is so bad at acting and should just call it quits. Ewan McGregor improved but Natalie Portman doesn't pull it off. The dialouge was also terrible. Everything Anakin said in the movie was stupid and just didn't sound good.

"The fact that the dialogue (especially the romantic stuff) is cringeworthy and awkward kinda makes sense for Anakin's character actually because he had never been in a relationship before so I can kind of understand why he's like this. I actually find this film more entertaining than the phantom menace because there is less senate meetings and more action and jedi aren't just sitting around in rooms this time because thousands of jedi go to help anakin and obi wan on geonosis. The most disappointing thing for me in this film is that there isn't really a story , someone is trying to asassinate padme and we eventually find out who but i feel like episode 2 should've just been the clone wars really and getting to know their characters more because they're a lot different to the stormtroopers eventhough they look similiar. Not gonna lie though to this day i do find some of the film entertaining.
The sub plot about sifo dyas wasn't explored at all really until the clone wars show which was interesting. Oh and christopher lee is great , i like him in anything he's in really , kinda like liam neeson..",0.18405797101449278,0.4637681159420289
"For the first two thirds of Attack of the Clones, the film ranges from total mediocrity to passable entertainment to horrific boredom. The dialogue is rather awful, the plot developed in a hackneyed manner. A couple of the early action sequences are fun, especially the one involving Jango Fett, whose young clone is named Boba (Boba Fett fans will be given their money's worth in this one!). The love story with Queen Amidala and Anakin Skywalker is truly execrable. I wouldn't dismiss Hayden Christensen as many have already (Portman is actually the film's weakest link). Just by chance, I saw about 2/3 of Life As a House the night before I saw Star Wars, in which Christensen stars as a troubled teen, much as he does in Attack of the Clones. He's not a bad actor, really. I would more blame the inadequacy of the character on the writing. Lucas has no clue how to develop emotions on screen, at least in this character, without shoving it into the dialogue. The only success that Lucas has in the character is in an homage to The Searchers, where Annie (they really need to stop calling him this; he'll turn into Darth Vader just because everyone keeps insulting his manhood!) goes off into the deserts of Tatooine to rescue his mother from a group of Sand People.

It's amazing what can be done with computers nowadays!  Special effects like these have become a trademark for Lucas' movies, one we have come to expect.  The romance between Anakin and Padme may be something other than what the dyed-in-the-wool sci-fi devotees were looking for in the ""Star Wars"" saga.  But seeing Yoda get in on the light saber fighting was a surprise to many.  This story answers questions raised by ""Episode I"" and the original trilogy.

I'm not sure what possessed George to hold back on showing Anakin as the powerful Jedi he was supposed to be but it was a bad decision. Anakin's duel with Dooku should've been better in content & directing. But again, there's few movies I'd rather watch than SW because of the good stuff. Even though I still question the wisdom of killing off Maul in TPM, I love Dooku. He's the ultimate precise, smug second fiddle. And can you get a better henchman than Jango Fett? I loved the mystery surrounding him & Kamino as well as Geonosis. I get chills every time I watch the first appearance of the future Stormtroopers.

For those familiar with the Star Wars saga (who aren't?), perhaps the most touching aspect of the movie is the almost inevitable slip of young Anakin towards the dark side.

Yes the Jedi are more amped to do more unbelievable stuff they could have been grounded a little bit more.You have to understand once the director has us he can take us anywhere do anything. Some say JarJar is too much and gets on their nerves and other things that annoys them about the new trilogy. You can say the same of the Ewoks in RETURN OF THE JEDI.I don't enjoy the original trilogy any more or less than the new trilogy. I think they are both satisfying. I seen the original Star Wars A New Hope in 1977 when I was 12 and it is my personal favorite film. No movie will do that for me as far as a movie-going experience again. I think it has to do with being young and something making an impression on you that is lasting. Now that i am older movies don't do that same thing for me even though I would like them to. It happens once in a lifetime. George Lucas has said that he wrote all the Star Wars movies and the Indiana Jones films in the style and vein of the thirties and forties movie serials. He wrote and gave us a big part of himself and made some really great movies. George did have Lawrence Kasdens writing help on EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI that may have given those films some thing that may now missing from the writing in the newer films. Nonetheless, George Lucas has innovated movie-making and entertained us immenseley.

"Three years ago, I remember the feeling I had while I was waiting to see Star Wars: Episode I. I had hopes of it being as great as the original three movies had been. However, Episode I was a great disappointment. Just today, I stood in line to see Episode II with a very doubtful and cynical disposition. I was expecting that it would be not much better than Episode I. I was very wrong. It is only one of two movies in which the entire audience clapped afterwards, the other movie being Lord of the Rings. This movie is what Star Wars is all about. Episode II: Attack of the Clones has all of the action that The Phantom Menace should have had. The quality of the special effects exceeds that of Episode I by leaps and bounds. The backgrounds are stunning! Without spoiling anything, I will say that this installment has THE best battle scenes of ANY Star Wars movie. The fights are fast-paced and exciting. Although it is quite humorous to see Yoda fight, that scene is simply incredible. If you have any doubts, as I did, about this movie get over it and GO SEE THIS MOVIE!

"Continuing the prequels to the original trilogy, from Razzie nominated director George Lucas, Anakin Skylwalker (Razzie winning Hayden Christensen) has grown up, and is now learning apprentice to Obi-Won Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). In this film, the Queen has quit, and is now Senator Padmé Amidala (Razzie nominated Natalie Portman), and is endangered by bounty hunter, later identified as Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), and it is Anakin's job to keep an eye on her. Along the way though, he breaks a Jedi rule by falling in love. Meanwhile, Obi-Won searches for the bounty hunter, and finds a planet where cloning of troops is taking place, apparently for the Rebels. Anakin feels very strongly about his mother, Shmi Skywalker-Lars (Pernilla August), so he takes Padmé with him to his home planet to find her, and he manages to find her, in dying moments, so he kills the desert people that kidnapped her (a step towards the Dark Side). Obi-Won is also on the planet, and he meets former Jedi, turned to Dark Side, Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus (Christopher Lee), and the battle soon after gets under way, as the clones (on the good side) attack the villains.

I was eleven when I saw Attack of the Clones, and even at that age I was smart enough to know what was wrong with this film. Arguably the worst Star Wars feature, Episode 2 is cheezy, badly written, and kinda boring.

Maybe this was the director and the script's fault, but Christensen turned many (including myself) off to this character.

"Being a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, when I first saw The Phantom Menace, I was disappointed, like most Star Wars fans were. Then Episode II came out and I read about it and started hearing how it's so much better than The Phantom Menace, and how Star Wars has been saved. Puh-leez! Episode II is by far the worst Star Wars movie to date. It just disgusts me. It's missing all the mysticism and the comedy, excitement, action, magic of the original trilogy, not to mention it's ten times more boring than Episode I. This has to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. It just drags on and on and on. It's a shame that a talented guy like George Lucas makes such crappy movies this days. He's let all these special effects capabilities he has go to his head. Episode II is all special effects and that's enough to ruin the movie right there. The original trilogy did not rely too heavily on special effects and it didn't need to because it had such a great story. The script for Episode II is a joke. George Lucas needs to start letting other people write the Star Wars scripts. The love story is so cheesy and completely lacking in the romance. The romance between Han Solo and Leia in the original trilogy was well acted and well written. But the dialogue between Padme and Anakin in this movie sounds like something out of a crappy Hallmark card. But I guess Lucas tries to make up for the crappy script by overloading the movie with special effects which just makes it seem superficial. The last 45 minutes of the movie that were supposed to be so dazzling and exciting were about as fun as watching paint try. And that Yoda fight that everyone was talking about it? It's ridiculous. Seeing a little digital Yoda running around doing flips and stuff made me laugh. In conclusion this movie sucks. bye.",0.10817743764172338,0.5701530612244898

"Though this movie looked kinda dull sometimes, I found it being effective. Like those Anakin Skywalker's spurt of anger scenes, it looked quite natural. Or when Obi-Wan Kenobi was fighting Count Dooku, he looked so helpless at that time, even before a fight, it was clear that Count Dooku is much more powerful. Though this trilogy is taking itself more serious, that doesn't bother me, I like when movie are taking themselves seriously. There were some good action sequences, especially in the end. I think that Anakin Skywalker's anger is well portrayed in this film and that is the most important in this trilogy. The only think I didn't like was that digital effects were used much to often in this film, sometimes it seemed that I'm watching cartoon not a film.",0.08640350877192983,0.5377192982456139
"The ""Star Wars"" saga is easily my favorite movie series of all time, and I have found enjoyment in every installment of the saga. ""Attack of the Clones"" is one of the three films in the series that I feel is underrated (the other two being ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Return of the Jedi""). To be honest, I wasn't even very interested in the ""Star Wars"" films until I saw this one and decided to pay more strict attention to it. I truly enjoyed this film, and it inspired me to go back and watch the earlier ones, which I fell in love with for the first time. This is definitely not the best film in the saga, and it ties with ""The Phantom Menace"" for my least favorite. Nevertheless, neither one of my least favorites is a bad film, and both are essential for the entire saga to play out. This film has some of the best dialogue of the three new ""Star Wars"" films. The love theme music is some of the best original music John Williams has written for the saga in quite some time. This movie also gives Yoda the best scenes he has been given since ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" particularly toward the end. It's not a perfect movie; the acting could be better, and some of the action scenes toward the end could have been cut down slightly. The film will not waste your time, however, and it is rich in character development and gives signs of what is yet to come in the saga.",0.22590612002376706,0.45863042186571606

"Okay, this was almost painful to watch. I really hoped Christopher Lee would save the movie, by playing the villain. Nope. His lines seemed copy-pasted from The Lord of the Rings. All that ""join me, old friend"" and ""the dark lord"" talk just seemed recorded and re-used. I almost saw his white robe and Gandalf right across the room. The upside is that at least Christopher Lee didn't have to learn new lines. What a shame, for such a good actor. I wonder what Lucas told him when he got the part? ""Hey Chris, look, I've got another villain role for you, don't bother preparing too much for it, just bring the LOTR script with you and cut out all references to the One Ring and Sauron and you've got the job!"" Even the arena scene just looked like Lee's figure has been cropped from The Two Towers and pasted there... I almost heard the words ""leave none alive!""... And then there's the arena scene. It was completely unrealistic. It was like the battle of Minas Tirith... I mean Annakin is fighting an robot-orc on top of a cross between an olyphant and the Balrog. Even the way the thing falls reminds me of the Olyphants...And the sounds it makes. Then, Obi-Wan fights something that looks like the praying mantis with a big aiming problem, and Padme is running away from a super-sized Garfield... But the character that failed completely in this movie was Yoda. Everywhere else he seems this calm little Buddhist with inverted phrases (which become intolerable in this episode), but now he's just this little rubber ball that jumps all over the walls...WHAT? For someone who knows the Force so well I could have expected levitation, but not this Xena Warrior Princess act. Anyway, to me this movie seemed like a cheap collage between The Gladiator, The Lord of the Rings and old karate movies. Pathetic, Lucas!",-0.008904521404521401,0.45658369408369404

"""The Phantom Menace"" was, without a doubt, the worst Star Wars movie, but it still wasn't bad. ""Attack of the Clones"" is MUCH better. Let's list the reasons, shall we? 1- It has MUCH more action, partly because it has the beginning of the Clone Wars. 2- The romance angle, although not as good as Han & Leia's, does what it is meant to do. 3- Obi-Wan goes on a detective spree! Yay! Go Obi-Wan! 4- Not to much Jar Jar Binky! Yes! 5- The visuals! Go visuals! But there are a few flaws. 1- One of the things that made Han & Leia's romance interesting was that it had not much kissy kissy goo goo stuff in it. But Anakin & Padme's does. 2- In this movie, Anakin, like Luke, gets his arm chopped off. When it is cut off, he shows no sign of pain other than a barely audible ""ugh"". 3- Another problem with the romance angle. Anakin is 19. Padme is 24. I'll leave you to figure out what's gross and disgusting about that. 4- Even though he's better than Jake Lloyd (Jake played Anakin in Episode 1, and seemed to be bored in his role. In fact, when I watch him, it makes Jabba the Hutt look like Ob-Wan), Hayden Christensen is awful and thus, he is Gayden Christensen among fans. Overall, I good Star Wars movie I recommend, but still not like the Originals. Watch it if you feel like it!",-0.005879934210526309,0.47061403508771926

This is an example of a big studio mercilessly cashing in on the loyalty of the fans by churning out mindless drivel like this, safe in the knowledge that loads of people will still flock to see it. The plot is slow and ponderous, the acting as wooden as in Phantom Menace. That young bloke who plays the future Darth Vader is one of the worst actors of all time. He seems to be in physical pain when he delivers his lines, so laboured are they. That Natalie Portman is a pretty girl for sure, but sadly she can't twin her natural talents with any gift for acting. Basically this film is mindless junk, so dull that any sane person would never watch it twice. Sci-fi in general is not my favourite genre, but this certainly doesn't convince me of its merits.

"This is terrible. Attack of the Clones doesn't do things that just infuriate Star Wars fans like the first prequel. There is no mention of midichlorians, and Jar-Jar is in it way less. In terms of insulting Star Wars fans this isn't as bad as ""The Phantom Menace"". In terms of which has less quality this one is worse. The dialogue is awful, and most of the actors are terrible. Anakin was extremely annoying in the first prequel, and he is even worse here. He complains all the time throughout the film, he is creepy, and is very unlikeable. The person who plays Anakin gives the worst performance in the film. Hayden Christensen is so bad that I want to punch him in the face. The dialogue he is given is shockingly bad, and he makes it sound even worse. The dialogue for everyone sounds less like Star Wars and more like a soap opera. Scratch that soap operas are way less cheesy. Then there is the worst thing about this thing. The romance between Anakin and Padme is the worst I have ever seen. The actors have no chemistry, the romantic dialogue is awful, Padme doesn't even seem to like Anakin until the script tells her to, Anakin does almost nothing right to make her fall in love with him, Anakin acts like a creepy stalker, it's extremely cliché, and it's the most forced romance ever. I would rather watch Jar-Jar sing in Star Wars on Ice than watch this romance again. It's that bad. There are a few things that are good about the movie. Christopher Lee as Count Dooko is great, and the score is excellent. Actually change that there is only two good things about the movie. The effects are good, but there is barely a scene that doesn't use a green screen or an effect. There is so much CGI that I felt like stabbing my eyes out. It feels so artificial. Even Yoda isn't even good in this movie. Frank Oz who was Yoda in the Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, The Phantom Menace, and the Star Wars film after this just isn't very wise. In Empire and Jedi he was a very wise, and was well acted from Frank Oz. When the prequels came along Yoda lost his wisdom. He stopped being interesting, and well acted by Frank Oz. Samul L Jackson doesn't fit the role he is given at all. The characters Jackson plays in his movies are usually badmouthed and violent. So when he was put in this movie what was he to do. Star Wars is largely geared towards kids so he couldn't start dropping F bombs. So he is given a role that is the exact opposite of what he is usually given. Therefor Jackson isn't given a chance to deliver a performance. It seemed to me that he was more reading his lines than acting. So Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones is a terrible movie.

I won't harp on the dialogue or acting, but as a Star Wars fan, it's just a bad Star Wars film. The characters are largely stupid, the action scenes have no meaning and feel disconnected from the plot, and much of the character motivation is either stupid or missing altogether. Lucas fails utterly to make central character Anakin sympathetic, and the weak plot with gaping holes does nothing to make up for this. Most people are raving about the big fight at the end and the Yoda vs. Dooku match, but to me the whole arena sequence was just an extended excuse for juvenile antics.

"I am a life-long Star Wars fan, but there's no denying that the long awaited prequel, The Phantom Menace, wasn't exactly a great movie. Lucas went wrong with that film because rather than retaining the style of the original trilogy, he was too keen to make the movie friendly to new audiences, and more specifically; a young audience, which made the film lacking in many older Star Wars fans eyes. Thankfully, by the time of the second sequel, Lucas seems to have learnt his lesson and the film has a much more adult slant to it, plus it has that lovely 'Star Wars' feel, so it comes across as being much more linked to the original trilogy of films. The story this time round makes for an exciting ride, and it sees the first real steps towards the original trilogy of films. We catch up with our lead characters sometime after The Phantom Menace, in the midst of a galactic war. Separatist leaders have gathered their collective armies and now, under the command of the mysterious Count Dooku, are posing a serious threat to the Republic, and when you add this to an assassination plot and a love story between Luke and Leia's parents, Anakin and Padmé, we've got a film on our hands!

"In my review of The Phantom Menace, which was quite favorable, I stated that making any kind of a prequel is a daunting task, as your audience generally knows where you are headed.  In order to do so and be successful you had better introduce some interesting, well rounded, well acted characters, and enough plot twists and surprises to keep the audience riveted and wanting to come back to find out what happens next.  While I thought George Lucas was off to a fairly good start in The Phantom Menace, in Attack of the Clones, he seems to have lost his way.  He now seems so intent to dazzle us with technology that he has forgotten some of the important things that audiences care about, such as a good script, good acting,  character development, and having the audience actually care about what happens to those characters he puts in the middle of all those dazzling special effects.  I can only guess that he has become so enamored of the technical side of film making, that nothing else seems to matter.

"I'm about sick and tired of seeing most people leave comments bashing this movie. First off, someone does not go to see Star Wars for the ""oscar"" winning acting. This has been established awhile ago, in the earlier movies. Secondly, you have to realize that although we know what is going to happen in the next few years for Anakin, Padme, etc., the characters do not. SO when someone comments on the whole forbidden love issue, and claims it is over done, clearly they do not understand the movie. The whole point of them emphasizing the forbidden love is because it is FORBIDDEN. Anakin takes a bold step being the only Jedi that loves, and as a result, evil things happen (eventually in Episode III). Visually, this movie is amazing, and will keep you entertain, rest assured. Also, someone said the whole Star Wars series is not a legacy. How dare a human with this belief be allowed to breathe the same air as me, because apparently they have no idea of past movie sales for any Star Wars films, let alone the craze that it has developed over the lase twenty-something years. In AOTC we learn so many things that weren't answered in previous films, such as the beginning of Storm Troopers, the rise of Senator Palpatine (aka the future Emperor...no that is not a spoiler, because it has been publically noted that that will happen in Episode III), and we see Bobba Fett as a child, and most importantly, we see exactly how Darth Vader is in his youth. This movie is incredible, and the fact that it is a mere $5.50 (student fare) is highway robbery. If movie theaters decided to charge what they felt was fair for the movie, I would not see it because I would not be able to afford it. Its that good.",0.1382205513784461,0.4679511278195489

But it does have a pretty complex story that can get confusing, it a good movie, but don't try to understand the logic, your brain will explode. Episode 2 is fun, it's a nice ride that can really can make you head spin, for the most part, but the few times its boring, its really boring and almost ruins the film.

"Is this the worst film ever made? Spoiler warning.  If you have not seen this film, please do not read on.  I would hate to spoil this incredibly moving, heart-warming, inspirational film for anyone. ""Attack of the Clones"" is the latest class project from the inmates at the Lucasfilm Asylum.  It follows on from the badly-received but commercially successful ""Phantom Menace"".  That last movie was a hideous mess of tedious dialogue, endless scenes where people sat around talking, pointless action sequences crammed in for no other reason than to sell video-game spin-offs, and banal special effects.  This new effort has been described by many as ""darker"" than the first.  Certainly, many of the scenes do take place at night.  It has also been described as ""better"" than the first.  Certainly, the audience I saw it with seemed to be having a great time, laughing uproariously at all the hilarious hijinks.  Causing particular amusement was the rib-tickling scene in which Anakin (""played"" by some computer-generated imbecile, as far as I could tell) goes back to find his mother.  He arrives just in time for her to say, ""I love yuuuurrrrghhhh"" and die in his arms. Brilliant!  With tears of laughter rolling down my face I marvelled at the wondrous imagination at play in this amazing movie.  What insight, what depth of feeling, what magnificent storytelling.  He arrives.  He finds her with no difficulty whatsoever.  She, upon laying eyes on him for the first time in eleven years, does not say, ""Where the **** have you been you selfish Jedi tw*t?"" or words to that effect.  She does not ask him why he did not try to rescue her eleven years ago.  He, in turn, does not question why anyone would pay money for someone to be a slave and then let her die (of what?  Boredom, probably).  It is very convenient he arrived when he did, though.  A minute later and she would have already been dead, and he would not know whether or not she loved hiurhhhhhggghhhh. Meanwhile, young Anakin is falling in love with a woman he last met when he was a little boy.  He has aged eleven years.  She has only aged three.  Do not ask questions.  Questions disrupt the balance of the force.  They fall in love.  She is a beautiful Queen/Princess/Senator.  She has no other admirers.  Who can explain this?  Do not ask questions.

"Hayden Christensen's acting is somewhat wooden in this movie. Although, looking back at Mark Hamill's performance he's probably not too bad. Natalie Portman is somewhat better but not by much. She basically is in the movie for eye candy appeal, which she's quite good at. While the movie is okay to watch, it just does not have the magic of the old 1977 original. That movie was fun to watch because the idea was new and the whole universe Lucas created was great to watch on film. A whole slew of sci-fi and fantasy movies were made over the next few years copying Star Wars. Lucas continued on with his series of movies, but by the third movie, enough was enough. These last recent offerings were made for the sake of money, not art. There are no surprises in the recent movies, they're just completing the story set up by the first three movies. When will Hollywood stop rehashing the same old ideas just for money's sake? There are a lot of new ideas, never put on film, waiting on the shelves of the local library.

"This movie absolutely amazed me and left me wondering.  When did it really all go to hell?  I like the original Star Wars movies.  There nothing mind-shattering, but they're good.  They certainly aren't good enough to have become what they became.  An American institution.  Moviegoers everywhere feel obligated to go see Episode II, even though Episode I was awful, because, well it's Star Wars.  And I saw it too.  But I saw it for free and still felt cheated.  The movie has no heart.  The dialogue is awful( fans say all the movies have bad dialogue and that's Star Wars ) The directing is flat, and yes I'll say that the special effects were awful.  I enjoy a pretty landscape as much as the next guy, but in the end, I'm not gonna like the movie because of some establishing shots.  The CG characters stick out like a sore thumb.  The characters never really look like their anywhere( they often don't cast shadows or reflections ).  The action scenes were boring( the clone factory one in particular ).  And as for the big Yoda scene.  I didn't see what the big deal was.  It was as forgettable as the rest of the movie.  Sure, the story is starting to piece together and there is no arguing that George Lucas has a vivid imagination.  But the movie just left a terrible sour taste in my mouth.

When I saw him act in the scene after he brings home his dead mother's body and talks about how unfair it is that he couldn't save her, I was actually intimidated. Not only is George Lucas setting up Anakin's tragic flaw, which is a traditional character trait of a Shakespearean tragic hero, but he is also foreshadowing the next movie where Anakin is going to give into a lust for power and anger and make the same mistake.

Now the dialog in the other Star Wars films is far from perfect but then again Lucas never really mastered dialog and thus it didn't make that much of an impact on me but the dialog was just so fake and unreal in this film that it sometimes made me want to laugh out loud.

"Attack of the Clones hit the theaters a week after the first Spiderman movie did. It was after watching the two movies one after the other that it hit me as to why I didn't like the Star Wars movies anymore (and why I loved the first two in particular so much). Spiderman had good dialog, a compelling story, and interesting characters who I cared about. Conversely, in Clones I didn't give a damn what happened to anyone in it. In all three ""prequel"" movies we see George Lucas' journey into special effects and cartoon character/CGI excess, but it's on display the most here..or maybe it's just that the dialog and characters are so weak that it just seems like it (Sith takes the prize for the most bells and whistles effects-wise). I realized that without fun, likable good guys and interesting bad guys to root for and against, all the effects and shoot 'em ups are pretty boring. Make that REALLY boring. And then Lucas tries to do a love story on top of that and proceeds to butcher it (I remember when he used to be able to direct..think the first Star Wars and American Graffiti). You should be able to do something with a doomed love affair to make it interesting, and Lucas does everything he can to suck the life out of it. Anakin Skywalker and Padme are so boring (and in the case of Anakin, irritating) that you wonder how they could possibly be Luke and Leia's real parents (switched at birth perhaps?) I also fault the performances, and Hayden Christenson's portrayal of Anakin in particular, but in his defense he had nothing to work with script-wise. The only remotely interesting character is Christopher Lee's too-little-seen Count Dooku. Otherwise, it's Lucas and his world of CGI cartoon characters and video-game action sequences.

Great special effects, which provides for sometimes astonishingly beautiful backgrounds of the cities in particular (I quite like the retro-inspired design of the spaceships too), the never-ending struggle between good and evil, personalised in the two generations of Skywalkers, and of course the sloppy romantic scenes. AOTC has the best specials effects you've ever seen, but for those who thought that the love-interest between Leia and Han was rather hair-raising, beware, because AOTC sets a new standard in that field too. Anakin is a whiny brat with the emotional capacity of a six year old, who tries to seduce Amidala with lines that have less romantic power than a list of ingredients on a pizzadelivery order form. No blame on Haydn Christensen, for even Brad Pitt couldn't have been interesting for Amidala with this kind of dialogue or role. She's a strong, independent woman, and there's no overwhelming chemistry between them blasting from the screen to give at least the smallest of an excuse for her being attracted to him. It's a shame, because I can imagine a lot of people dislike the film because of this subplot, when for the rest, after the terrible Phantom Menace, AOTC is among the best in the Star Wars series: a more complex plot than the Episodes 4 to 6, which poses intriguing questions and makes one look forward to Ep 3, a dark, gloomy atmosphere, lot's of action-packed sequences, an *ss-kicking Yoda, and, as mentioned before, excellent SE and design.

It also contradicts the force in Yoda, who explains so many times to Luke in the original trilogy, how things are only large in someone's head, and not harder to move, when he saves OB1 and Anakin. Too extreme a gap also between the ""can I play Mommy, can I play mommy"" Anakin in Episode 1 to a dark Anakin in Episode 2 while he could have fixed it by playing Anakin in Ep. 1 stronger, darker, more focused.

I mean, let's be honest, he is pretty good looking. And Natalie is beautiful. At first, I didn't think the two had much ""chemistry"" but as the movie progressed, I could see they did.

"As just about everybody disliked the Phantom Menace for many reasons; Jar Jar, little Anakin, weak villains, and what does it have to do with the other Star Wars trilogy besides having Obi-Wan and Anakin in it? Well this Star Wars is not only a much better movie, it makes Phantom Menace look like a better movie; Anakin gets touchy when he's being insulted, the Trade Federation going down and then nearly starting the Clone War, Anakin leaving his mother which nearly pushes him over the edge. This film perfectly sets things up for Episode III and the rest of the saga; Palpatine gaining almost all control, a great decline in Jedi Knights from the Battle of Geonosis which will make them easier to wipe out by Palpatine, a whole army at his command, Anakin starting his path to the dark side. For the people who didn't like this one and/or Episode I, I think will appreciate the films much more once they're all complete. The movie is by far one of the best movies I've seen, it comes in third with the Star Wars saga, just behind Empire and Star Wars. Ewan McGregor was my favorite guy to watch on screen, he does a much better job than he did in Menace and we want to see more of him. Portman is much better too, she doesn't speak in the monotone that killed her performance in Menace. Hayden, a brilliant actor in which we know he's gonna become Vader but we still think of him as our hero beside McGregor. The visuals were extraordinary, action scenes blew me away, the love story, not my type of Vodka but they live in a totally different place than us, people off in space on other worlds aren't gonna go up to a chick and say, ""Hey baby, what up? Can I buy you a drink?"" I believed the love story, Anakin probably did what we all wish we could do, put his feelings into exact words. But, the one thing that you have to like, even if you hated everything else, is Yoda. Oh my God! I just about wet my pants when I saw him fight, and so did just about the rest of the theatre. (I saw it at midnight, opening night) We all cheered at four points; when Yoda walked out, when Yoda did a little Bruce Lee-like pose, when Yoda whipped out his lightsaber, and then the entire fight scene.

"Star Wars: Episode 2: Attack of the Clones (2002): Dir: George Lucas / Cast: Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lee, Ian McDiamid: Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away there lived a director named George Lucas who made great films such as THX 1138, American Graffiti and Star Wars. Since then he has ventured into the dark side of Hollywood making two embarrassing Star Wars prequels. Title regards diversion much like its advertising. Queen Amidala is now a Senator and young Jedi Anakin Skywalker and his mentor Obi Wan Kenobi are assigned to protect her. A poison dart leads Kenobi to a cloning planet where he discovers Junga Fett as a threat. Meanwhile Anakin attempts to get into the pants of the Senator, and Lucas even treats viewers to an embarrassing roll in the meadows. Breathtaking special effects accompany ridiculous storytelling and dreadful acting by Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman with Ewan McGregor and Christopher Lee submerged in cardboard roles. Lee plays the villain Count Dooku who is given a light saber battle against Yoda, which is either a surprise or a joke judging from its staging, Ian McDiamid plays the Emperor whose job is to sh*t disturb and cause divisions in the force.

"Review of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones There is always a mixed sense of anticipation and excitement in air when a new Star Wars movie hits the theater. I'm going to lay this statement down now that this review is currently rough because I've only seen the movie once since it hit the big screen. There is a ton going on in this film, that one theatrical viewing isn't just enough. Well before I start sounding more like a Frito-Lay commercial then a stunned fan; who saw movie magic a mire eighteen hours ago. After seeing the opening crawl were instantly taken away from the beginning and more innocent story of The Phantom Menace. Attack of the Clones fully embraces us with cruelty of life. Immediately we see signs of death; first there are the Senator Padme Amidala assassination attempts, which leads us through the lower depths of Coursant. After that, the movie revolves around death and separation.  George Lucas and John Hales never stray from this fact; they keep it honest and truthful. Throughout the movie Lucas gives an ugly look at war, and how death affects us. While the popular thing these days is to be patriotic; Lucas goes in the exact opposite direction he reminds us that no matter how much we think were right, hurting others also hurts ourselves.  Which leads to the main focus of the film, Anikin Skywalker throughout the film we see him make poor choices, but he still has a good heart. Anikin seems to want to fall into a different destiny that the Jedi Council asks him to serve.  This is what makes the movie absolutely great. Everyone character in the film seems to sense this and center itself toward Anikin as change completely takes shape. Attack of the Clones drives us deep into the Star Wars Saga, it evolves the story straight off of The Phantom Menace and stays dedicated to the original trilogy. On that note, this movie is still definitely Present Trilogy; people who dogged TPM for the CG will dog the CG in this movie. As for myself the adrenaline rushes I get from watching dozens of gorgeous worlds and species is to much to bare, you just got to bask in its riches.  This movie is definitely worth a few theatrical viewings. On the technical side of things, the dialog was typical for a Star Wars film wooden but forgivable.  For once the rocky dialog paid off for Star Wars as the love scenes which seemed to be very cheesy, but when you think of the characters Padme and Anikin, they really are such high regarded people with infinite amount of intelligence that knowing how to express feelings is going to lead to shady communication. This film is a complete through back to The Empire Strike Back; the similarities are very eerie.  Obi-Wan provides the wit comedy of Han Solo, Anikin provides the recklessness, but gifted student like his son Luke, Jango provides his cleverness and loyalty like his son, Count Dooku adds the confidence and treachery of Darth Vader, Mace Windu adds an edge, and Yoda redefines the phrase ""Bustin' out the Woopin' Stick.""

"I will start by saying where I stand on Star Wars Films. I still recall seeing Star Wars as a child with my parents and it blew me away. I have never collected the figures or read any of the books I love to watch the movies. There are many films I enjoy from the Shrek to Lord of the Rings have all been favorites of mine. My personal favorite Star Wars goes like this Empire, A New Hope, Jedi-didn't like the muppets much, and then Phantom Menace. Films in my home collection run from Gladiator to James Bond and the Mummy. I must say the Phantom Menace was watchable but not a great movie to me. Jar Jar drove me crazy with his slapstick, and my nephews and nieces that I thought would get a buzz from seeing Star Wars thought it just Ok. My wife fell asleep, though she enjoys watching the originals. I recently saw episode two. I loved it, so did my nieces, nephews and wife. The story kept moving along at a good pace. The settings were amazing. If romance was not your cup of tea it would soon move back to Obi's detective story and the last 45mins were a blast. The politics,my nieces and nephews did not seem to understand, but for me were the most interesting part of the story, how everyone was being manipulated. In the Phantom Menace there were some good surroundings but the characters didn't seem to interact with them in this film you could see the depth to the city and felt as part of the locations. I felt actually cold out there in the rain with Obi in part of the movie. The dialogue in the romance scenes was a little corny but I'm used to that from the Star Wars universe, I've also sprouted some pretty corny lines myself when young and in love.

"I love Episode 1 and 3, but 2 has always been one of the most terrible Star Wars movies. There is still a lot to love about it though.

We just check in to see him moping and talking about sand. Every time we check in with Obi-wan, it is amazing. But when we check back to Annakin... not so much. The romance is odd because the guy was a kid when he met her, it just doesn't make any sense why she would view him as anything other than a kid.
However, the last part of the film is amazing. We get to see Yoda finally fight with a lightsaber, which a lot of us always wanted to get a glimpse of. It was amazing to watch, and to this day is mezmerizing. What a fight!",0.23842592592592599,0.550462962962963

The mushy love scenes weren't too bad at all and tied together the way Luke and Leia were created.  I only wished Anakin and the two lightsaber fight with Dooku would have lasted longer.  Also, Obi Wan seemed tougher in the first movie, but oh well.  I can't wait to see the next part when he and Anakin fight.  By the way, what ever happens to Padme, Mace Windu, and the other Jedi? Yoda is Still the man.  Up until now we have all wondered why this little green freak was so much of a great and esteemed Jedi.  Now we know.  He wasn't larger when younger or shrink with age.

After all, it had lightsaber duels, dazzling battle scenes, giant monsters, Yoda fighting, and of course, Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) was reduced to little more than a blink-and-you'll-miss-him cameo. It seemed as though George Lucas had listened to the many complaints made about the previous film and took these on board when developing the next script. I did see it again at the cinema, and a few more times on DVD, and each time I disliked it more and more. It became apparent that I had blinkers on in 2002, and I was simply relieved that it wasn't the stilted mess it had been 3 years earlier.

That is a given. For them to proclaim that this is somehow superior to the Introduction that was Episode I because of those more familiar elements, is just asinine.

"The Dialogue in this movie is terrible. ""I don't like sand, it's rough""-Anakin SkyWalker.
Padme and Anakin romance is handled poorly and you don't care about the falling in love.
Palpatine sends Count Dooku to kill Padme, Dooku sends Jango Fett to kill Padme. Jango gets sends a shapeshifter to kill Padme. The Shapeshifter sends killer worms to kill Padme. Yes you heard it..killer worms. This movie is terribly boring. Anakin Is a huge prick in this movie and he and Obi Wans are almost never on good terms. Obi Wan, Anakin, and Padme are again very boring in this movie. We are never told why exactly the separatists want to leave the Republic, all we know is that Palpatine is behind it all. Regardless this movie does have some highlights.
Anakin killing the all the Tsukin raiders including all of the wives and the children who caused the death of him mom. Is actually good for his character, and foreshadows his darkness in the next movie.
Jango Fett character is also pretty cool and the whole clone army situation being clones of him is all very cool.
Count Dooku cutting of Anakin arm was cool and Yoda coming in clutch and saving him and Obi Wan was very cool.
Palpatine is again lame in this movie , idk why George Lucas decided it for it to be Jar Jar binks of all people to be the one to elect Palpatine as new head chancellor.

"OK, now as I have said in my other Star Wars Prequel Reviews, I will do my utmost to give this film a fair review and point out anything that is good if I find it. OK, let's start with the plot; This film is set 10 years after the events of ""Episode I"" and Queen turned Senator Amidala of Naboo is returning to Coruscant to vote on the creation of a ""Grand Army of the Republic"" to counter the uprising Sepratist Movement, when an attempt is made on her life. Fearing that she may be in mortal danger, Chancellor Palpatine asks the Jedi Council to place the senator under their protection. Enter the now adult Anakin Skywalker, and his master Obi-Wan Kenobi. After another attempt is made on the Senator's life, the Jedi Council decide to send Anakin away with her to her home planet of Naboo where they hope she'll be safe, while Obi-Wan goes off to pursue a lead on the planet of Kamino, where he discovers a secretly manufacture Army of Clones. At the same time, Anakin and Padme slowly begin to fall in love. At the same time, Anakin is racked by horrid dreams of his mother being tortured on his home planet of Tatooine, and leaves Naboo with Amidala to find her. Upon arriving, he quickly meets his step father and takes flight after his mother, only to find her as she is dying. As she dies in his arms, he looses all control of himself and slaughters the entire village of the Sand People who kidnapped his mother. While this is happening, Obi-Wan confronts the man responsible for the two failed attempts on Padme's life and, and after a brief confrontation, he pursues the man (Jango Fett) to the Septatist Base World of Geonosis, where he discovers Count Dooku, a former Jedi, now leader of the Sepratist Movement, and Obi-Wan is captured. Answering his distress signal, Anakin comes to his aide, and he and Padme too are captured. As a demonstration of his power, Dooku orders the trio's execution in a giant arena, but as the final blow is about to be struck, Jedi Master Mace Windu and Jedi Master Yoda arrive with a force of Jedi Knights and Clone Troopers to hopefully save Anakin and Obi-Wan and capture Dooku and stop a full scale War. In the ferocity of the battle, Anakin and Ob-Wan face off with Dooku, who easily defeats the two and is about to kill them until Yoda shows up and saves them, but Dooku escapes and the war begins, thus we have a sequel yet again.",0.12766666666666665,0.5726666666666668
"I thought this movie was very good. The only thing that bothers me is Yoda is now computer animation. In Star Wars I he was a low quality puppet. Now he looks different, more like the Yoda of the Episodes IV-VI and they might as well go back and draw computer animation over Yoda in Episode I because they invaded the other Episodes with animation. This movie has a lot of boring parts like where Anikin and the Queen fall in love. I find myself skipping to the next scenes. At least Jar-Jar isn't the lead star of this movie like in Episode I. Episodes I-III seem like they're made for kids, when the IV-VI seem like more serious science fiction movies.",0.05012820512820512,0.517051282051282

Lucas is really however a great master of this kind of movies from the technical point of view, maybe the greatest one. The movie theme is the endless fight of good and evil expressing itself here in well built scenes of battles or individual duels of great strength and movement. This kind of movies for lack of imagination of what can be a different world in terms of towns, buildings, clothes, weapons and general behaviour, often recreate past centuries images with frequent reference to the Middle Age or even the antiquity. In this particular movie we have even the recreation of some kind of Roman Circus fighting with a lot of adaptation (lions replaced by monsters etc). One last word to characterize what in my opinion is a good sci-fi novel or movie. Not that one where Cowboys and Indians (or nazis and democratic armies) are replaced by people with futurist clothes and weapons but fighting for the same values as we know them today but a story where we are faced with fictional different values, a different social and social structure i. e. a really different world being the work of the author's creative mind.

He killed a whole race of people, not to say that they did not deserve it, but a Jedi can not act that way. In this movie Yoda was the only character that kept the dignity of the Jedi. Yoda was the only Jedi that did not get his butt kicked in the flick. I thought Jedi were supposed to be strong and save the world? And whats with the corny one liners? C3P0 says, ""I am beside myself"", as its severed head lays beside its body, and it also says, ""What a drag"", as its head is being dragged on the ground. Its barely laughable.

"Everyone knows that the prequel trilogy in the ""Star Wars"" universe is light-years far from the magical results George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan managed to pull off with the originals. However, I'm not inclined -like many hardcore fans- to completely destroy these movies as if they were some of the worst results in the history of cinema, and with Episode II, which I consider the halfway between the pretty bad I and the pretty good III, I have the chance to explain why. This film starts off as a pretty boring one, making the viewer fear for the worst, but as the plot progresses it shows its interesting political points and some impressive CGI scenes, if you consider that in the early 2000s this technology was the life itself for action/adventure motion pictures. It surely lacks the wonderfully amusing relationships and characters that developed in the originals (except C3PO and R2-D2, who are lovely as usual and are used in a more active way than ""Episode I""), and the ""love story"" between Anakin and Padmé is good only as a script, but fails on the actual complicity between the lead actors, who seem ashamed of taking on a romantic scene. That's one of the big problems here: Hayden Christensen is an awful actor and the single worst choice in the whole series of films also considering the key character he's entrusted with. Obviously he can't take all of the blame, as the man who should have directed him and the others in the right way apparently does nothing to help, with no acting direction at all (I hope!) and uninspired shots. That said, I will save this flick and brand it as an enjoyable one, when not considering the let-down you get knowing what kind of masterpieces George Lucas had been able to invent in the past (with the evidently needed help of his brilliant collaborators).",0.07023809523809522,0.6256642512077296

"This time Obi Wan and Anakin face off against separatists led by Count Dooku, while Chancellor Palpatine has taken more power, also Anakin is in love with Padme. Upon rewatching the prequels, the only one that is necessary to even watch is Revenge Of The Sith. As honestly everything in the first two could've easily been implied in two 10 minute flashbacks. Attack Of The Clones is particularly pointless, again the thrust of this movie is relatively irrelevant, as we know who's pulling the strings and who's going to win and because the movie is as flatly directed and lamely acted as Phantom Menace, the action, politics and drama are largely banal.

I have to admit that my viewing of Attack Of The Clones was very much spoilt because i watched it on a very poor quality DVD and therefore have a biased view on this film. From what i could see this looked a lot better than the last movie but still did not have the magic of the first three films. My theory is that the last two film have far too much Computer animation which does not have the same appeal as the Models being filmed to look like aliens or space ships as they did in Star Wars. Also i dont like the cast. Ewan Mcgregor sounds naff when he puts on that Alec Guiness accent also i think as Natalie Portman has got older she has got a lot less interesting and less pretty.Samuel L Jackson is good but we see little of him to brighten the film up. What we really need is another Harrison Ford of Mark Hammel. The Story is nothing special but its hard to tell when your watching a cheap pirate DVD. Never again will i buy one. The Kids will love this but as for true Sci Fi fans i would stay stick with Star Trek. 7 out of 10.,0.16596861471861474,0.43915584415584413

"I hold Star Wars in such high esteem that I'm going to rip this movie way more than it deserves; it's relative to the other films. This is the only bad entry of the 6 films. It's so bad. The opening scene where the decoy Padme gets her ship blown up is done in such horrible fashion. It's presented horribly. There are no interesting cuts or details or anything. The scene didn't capture me at all, just lame. Then some Jedis talk some things out, and Anakin is put in charge of personally guarding and protecting Padme, (ok, great...this could lead to some great scenes) but it turns into a complete love story, and a lame love story at that, believe me. No good lines or exchanges between Padme and Anakin. Very Weak. Obi-Wan is given the task of investigating this Clone Army, and this results in the best part of the movie. Kenobi fights Jango Fett, a very cool scene, and then proceeds to follow his ship which is another very cool scene. It leads to Kenobi getting captured by Count Dooku, so Anakin and Padme have to come rescue him. Just when you think it might be finally picking up and getting good, it turns into the animated series Attack of the Clones and Skywalker ends up in a factory fighting a bunch of alien-bugs while having to use his Jedi prowess to avoid getting smashed in the assembly line. So bad. What potential for a scene, Anakin has to go save Kenobi from Dooku, and this is where Lucas takes it. Was he making this movie for 7 year olds? It goes on as they're all imprisoned and set to be eaten by a bunch of uncreative, lame creatures. So bad. Then the epic final battle breaks out with all the Jedis. Sounds great...not really. Most of the time they're fighting the same ol' droid with little variety, and really all you see is Jedis deflecting laser beams. Mace Windu does actually shine during this battle. His scenes are really good, but it's the only good part of the entire 'epic' battle. So Yoda swoops in to whoop some tail, wait, no, he's just there to give them a ride. OK. Whatever. Off to chase Dooku now, which is a decent scene, Yoda's really good at giving orders. Skywalker and Kenobi eventually catch Dooku and we are given a very nice lightsaber duel. Dooku is too strong, but then Yoda shows up. We get to see Master Yoda fight. Yes! The duel is way too short, but good, up until the end. The way Dooku escapes is so ridiculous, forcing Yoda to use the force to prevent the massive pillar from crushing Anakin and Obi-Wan's bodies. Narrow minded and uncreative. Why didn't Yoda force push their bodies out of the way, then go whoop Dooku some more? Why didn't Anakin or Obi-Wan just move? There were like 100 things wrong with that moment. The ending, just like nearly all the other scenes, was a letdown. There could have been so much more dynamic in all of the action scenes. The overall writing is just weak, and you know what, the set designs are weak too. You think that's one thing Lucas wouldn't mess up (the first 3 were so good in this area) but the sets lack proper detail. What a failure of a movie. Compared to the rest of the saga, this movie is a 3 outta 10, but I guess it deserves a 6.",0.05519323671497584,0.5715096618357489

"Star wars movies, are all more or less great. Though, I've seen them all over the course of the years, I wanted to comment on this one, in case anyone from the director universe or other (editing) listens, in case, they feel at some stage they want to take movie making onto another level. For any movie that is. I do not understand, how, not sure what date Star Wars takes place, certainly in the distant future, we still have explosions. At the beginning of the movie when they attempt to kill the princess, when the space ship gets fired at, smoke comes out. Smoke ???? In year 2500, 3000? Come on! (Maybe petrol, and petrol companies, still control our lives!!!) What about lasers, melting, disappearing, etc. We had an atomic bomb in 1945, 69 years ago, and you show Star Wars in smoke. I'm sure, you can try better, at all levels. There must be consistency in MOVIES, when in one movie, a guy with super powers goes at lightening speed, and in the next scene, you see him fight with human speed. Anyone??

Just like The Phantom Menace, this film suffers from weak dialogue (especially in the romance sequences) rather flat acting (especially from Hayden Christensen - whose performance FYI will thankfully improve in Revenge of the Sith), and an over-reliance on CGI. However, the film is more in line with the Original Trilogy (i.e. we see primitive Star Destroyers and Storm Troopers), the music is better soley because of a beautifully constructed new theme by John Williams (Across The Stars - the Love Theme for Anakin and Padme). And the last 45 minutes is what we come to expect from Star Wars - the action-packed Battle of Geonosis.

The story line is great. The opening chase scene is great. Obi-Wan's search for the missing planet is great. The final battle is great. Most all of it is great. And, one thing that I greatly appreciate about this film is Christopher Lee's performance as Count Dooku. Funny name aside, Lee turns out a convincing portrayal of a lead antagonist that makes you understand what the Dark Side is all about. I found Darth Maul to be rather lacking as a villain in ""Phantom Menace"", but Lee makes up for this in profound fashion.with Anakin and Yoda fighting to stop count dooku from changing Anakin as they found out who hired her. The Jedi Council assigns Obi-Wan Kenobi to discover who has tried to kill Amidala and Anakin to protect her in Naboo. Obi-Wan discovers that the dart is from the planet Kamino, and he heads to the remote planet.

There is some high stakes action, but much of it feels unreal for what has been set up for the characters previously. The plot certainly lacks direction and purpose, driving towards no real goal. Fortunately, a Williams score is wonderfully present and some visuals are actually pleasing, with a few awesome fight sequences. Still, the end of the feature leaves the audience without a real sense of achievement or loss, due to its lack of attention to any intriguing plays on emotional depth.

"Stuck between The Phantom Menace(99) and Revenge of the Sith(05), this one-sixth of the Star Wars saga may end up being the most forgettable of all. There are no scenes which seem to stand out and at least embed themselves in the memory. Phantom Menace may have been a bit slower going but at least you had the devil-like Darth Maul killing a Jedi Knight and the first glimpse of a planet-sized city. The climax here is still my favorite sequence of this film, with Chris Lee showing off his still-formidable chops, but this doesn't say much for the rest of the picture. Annakin Skywalker has grown up from a cute little boy of Phantom Menace into a pouting young man (Christensen), mentored, with difficulty, by Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor). The Jedi Knights (led by Yoda) deal with mysterious plots to create an army of clones, which are scheduled to fight some war for some reasons unknown. Annakin learns about loss, in a couple of different ways, and begins a slight turn towards the dark side, in the form of vengeance. It looks like Christensen was instructed to act younger than he is because that part does work out - he comes across as very immature. Meanwhile, the clone army wears the same stormtrooper white armor we all first saw in Star Wars(77 aka A New Hope), which means they were all clones...? Darth, where are you when we need yuh?

To start Episode 2 is in my opinion the weakest out of all 6 of the Star Wars films, and the reasons for this thought are many. Although it's a well made film it just mainly lacks the energy and excitement of the other films in the saga, and most notably the original trilogy. Part of the reasons for this is the weak acting by almost every member of the cast(minus Ewan McGreggor), and the occasional flat dialogue. Still minus all of this, there is still lots to enjoy about this one. The special effects are all top notch and the action is good, and the new planets and environments are very imaginative.

While a lot of the early reviews have panned the love story and the performances of Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, I would tend  to disgree,, yea they arent as good as some of the elders, but they are ok and the romance (while perhaps taking up a bit oo much screen time) is properly handled as a kindof corny flirtation between two teenagers who are both somewhat full of themselves. While the film does have its flaws (some slow sections towards the middle, some shaky character animation) on the whole it work as part of the ""Star Wars"" epic and is an entertaining rollercoaster ride on its own. And if you are paying attention to all the undertones if what is really happening beneath the surface, its almost a greek tragedy. I do definitely reccomend the movie.

"The only thing positive I can say about this film is that it is better than Phantom Menace. That is the only thing I can say that makes this movie remotely recommendable... That doesn't necessarily mean its a great film, let alone a good one. The film suffers from being too creatively controlled by George Lucas. The reason why Empire was good was that Lucas only wrote the script... And it had to be revised. It is his usual tension-free, bland dialogue script that gives the movie a minority of its problems. This was a classic example in the fool me once shame on him, fool me twice shame on me. The producers should have seen this coming and should not have given Lucas as much creative control as he did. Most of the plot devises he sets up crashes and burns. It is a catastrophe of epic proportions. The ""romance"" in this film between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman crumbles because of bland dialogue and implausible plot devises. ""I'm a senator"" Samuel L Jackson, Ewan McGreggor and Christopher Lee give decent performances. The problem is is that they are so detached with their environment. Like their only purpose was to take out a lightsaber each scene. But with Hayden Christensen... Good God what happened there? Some of the worst acting, no, worst line delivery I have seen in a while. Tommy Wiseau could give better line delivery than that man. But no, The script isn't the downfall of the film, nor is the acting. The use of CGI in every scene, literally every scene is what killed the film for me. The effects added zero tension zero thrills and had zero purpose. In the end, this film had to be the darkest of the trilogy because it was the second act, the characters needed a challenge they could overcome.

You get to see Anakin becoming a jedi and taking his first steps toward losing himself. You learn about an impatient side to him that will ultimately be his undoing. The movie itself focuses on Anakin's many relationships. That with his mother, with Padme, the Jedi Council, Obi-Wan and, of course, the man that would be Emperor Palpatine. For the importance of forwarding the plot, this movie was vitally important to the series. As a movie in general, I was not entirely impressed. I felt like Anakin was portrayed as way too immature for the man that would ultimately become Darth Vader. In episodes 4, 5 and 6, Darth Vader is ultimate Evil.

Ewan did a much better job then he did on Episode I. Christopher Lee was as good as always and Yoda rules, also. The computer effects get a little out of control some times.

"In my point of view the Attack of the Clones is the worst of the Star Wars series as a whole. To start Natalie Porman portraits Amidala, the mother of the heroes of the future rebellion Luke and Lya, as just a pretty chick ,which has, for some reason , at the end a crash for a annoying teenager ,which has no control of his emotions and has killed a village. I do not care if they killed his mother, Anakin Skywalker is a Jedi OK to kill two to three persons in rage but then he should pull himself together ,not in sense do a small genocide!! Also the Jedis are even more useless the the Phantom Menance (if that is possible) and it takes them about 80% of the running time to act in effective manner. In the point they see a millions strong army just emerge almost out of thin air and the President of the Senate use them to take extra authority, due to the break up of the Galaxic Rebuplic.Why the can not think that something big is going on behind the scenes, if they can not read the mind of him( because he is the Leader of the Sith) or even the persons close to him? The battle at the end though nice to look at is clones against droids, in other worlds the soldiers in both sides are next to nothing to be as easy to replace as a pair of socks!! And the cgi is a pain to my eyes and seen it again ,brings me tears, because ,one the animated series The Clone Wars has better designs and is a TV series!! And second and most important Star Wars is at the every least lay the foundation of the Computer Generated Images (CGI) as a whole, with out its offer the effects may still look like as before Star Wars ,fake to the point of laugh.But my biggest complains are that this flick, first, is plain merchandise movie, made just to sell toys and action figures and not to tell a good story. Second and by far my biggest problem however is the man himself George Lucas ,who was director, lead producer and main financier of the movie.

"George Lucas brought in co-writer Jonathan Hales to help him improve over his (Lucas') solo writing effort on 1999's 'The Phantom Menace'.  Even some of the cast of that 1999 film agreed recently that it was a pretty flat effort given the expectations of the 'Star Wars' legacy.  Perhaps it wasn't a bad thing that 'The Phantom Menace' was a little flat because you want the films to get better as you go along, don't you?  Well, 'Attack of the Clones' has a much better outcome because it is dark like 'The Empire Strikes Back' and Lucas is smart.  By making this film he realizes that the darker they get, the more fascinating they become for the mind set of the science fiction fan.  Many hard core 'Star Wars' fans consider 'The Empire Strikes Back' to be the best of ALL 'Star Wars' movies.  'Attack of the Clones' has the best look of ALL the 'Star Wars' films because of the progression of technology in the area of special effects.  I never expected the second coming with the release of these last two films in the last three years and with the upcoming final chapter in 2005..... but it will be interesting to see how Lucas will cap off the first three stories before we can look back on the last three made a generation ago but still, it has a reach to all generations, from ages 8 to 80.",0.17650935374149657,0.3823554421768708
"i give it only has a 5/10. Why? The acting is very wooden, and of course the CGI was terrible. But, I can only deduct 3 stars because of this. Why? First off, acting was NEVER the strong point of Star Wars (Remember Princess Leia in the first one, talking in a British accent in a few scenes? Jesus!). The cast here is assembled of good actors. With the exception of Ewan McGregor and Ian McDirmid and Christopher Lee(Who pull their roles off brilliantly), Hayden Chistensen and Natalie Portman overacted to actually make the horrible script sound good. They tried to hard - if you saw them in other films they did, I think you'd get a different perspective on their acting. But it was the writing. As for the computer effects, well it looks too cartoonish in many places. Even Yoda's sword fight didn't impress me. So, what was good about this movie? Well, you do see traces of Vader every now and then. You see the Clone Wars unfold and the 'plans' for the Death Star. I give Attack of the Clones 7/10 because it must be deliberately weak to pave way for Revenge of the Sith, which I am sure will be far more superior to this one. You could only wish that George Lucas would have had a plot line that would have accommodated the more superior special effects of the original trilogy. That's right - I do believe the effects from A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi are way better than these. Oh well, you can't win 'em all.",0.19068124857598542,0.5353222070327333
"Though it's a worthy addition to the `Star Wars' series (there's lots of eye candy), the aura of gee-whiz and kid-like vigor that has come to be expected has been replaced with a grimness of purpose that drains most of the fun out of the experience; what's left is creator George Lucas' relentless intention of ramming a narrative down your throat. Almost completely devoid of humor, Lucas seems to have put his blinkers on: in between chase and battle sequences are long, dull stretches of exposition meant to `explain' Anakin Skywalker's descent into Darth Vader (as played by Hayden Christensen, he's both a teenage rebel and a budding fascist) as well as his blossoming romance with politician Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). For the most part, the action sequences, while elaborate and convincing, are overlong; the final section, the actual clone attack, has so much going on and to such lengthy extremes that you begin to get distracted and confused (although Yoda, as the field general, keeps telling you what's supposed to be going on). The acting itself, usually reliable if not spectacular, this time around seems to have a joylessness to it (Ewen McGregor appears to have phoned in his Obi-Wan Kenobi) that makes things seem drearier than they should, although Christensen does have a nice, startling moment when he describes the rage he felt avenging an important death. In the end, though, the visuals make the enterprise worth it, particularly a short, monochromatic fight scene in a driving rainstorm on top of a mushroom-shaped building--it's vastly different from anything in the entire color-drenched series and wonderfully memorable.",0.09806397306397306,0.4867845117845118

Episode Two didn't suffer from the CGI overload that plagued it's predecessor.  The visual effects are an integral part of the story line, and almost take on the power of a lead actor or actress on the screen, without bludgeoning the audience into numbness.  Ewan McGregor seems very comfortable in his role as Master Kenobi, and steals the movie with an outstanding performance.  Despite Lucas's vision of this being the story of the raise and fall of Anakin, it is much more interesting to see Obi-Wan as a young man.

It really doesn't show it was shot on digital video.

I remember loving the huge Jedi fight almost at the end, but now seems pointless and out of the blue. Oh, well. Surely plenty of fans will keep loving it. It's good if you're not really watching it and you just use it as background noise, that way you won't feel like you've lost two and a half hours of your time. Thank you Amazon Prime for that. Most of the action scenes still feel entertaining and maintain the tension, but you've got to endure for that. I miss George Lucas' obsession in making better cuts every certain time, because many times the CGI doesn't hold very well, some scenes have this video game texture and others you have the feeling the actors aren't in those scenarios.

"Attack of the Clones had the unenviable distinction of being not so much the prequel to Star Wars but the sequel to the Phantom Menace. If movies were people this would be like finding out you were Hitler's nephew or worse, Charlton Heston's son. Menace achieved a lot, namely what many thought impossible; permanently sapping the lustre from what was an almost universally adored series. If the sparkle was to return to those stars this had to first class, grade A, top of the class stuff. Any reminder of its predecessor beyond the bare bones of plot continuity were therefore wise to avoid at all costs. Clones partially succeeds in restoring some pride to the series. Structually its better than its predecessor, the plot more straightforward and less marred by political spiel than before. However, this can't hide its wider failings. Just as before, none of the newer characters fail to make any impact. There's no Han Solo or Luke to offer us the simple pleasures of before. Padme no longer speaks with a lifeless monotone and could almost pass for a real human being. Binks, reviled by the entire universe has a greatly reduced role. Lucas puts two fingers up at those who maligned his 'comic' creation, i.e. everyone and ensures Jar Jar is central to a key plot point thus justifying his existence in the series. He'll claim it was planned that way all along of course but you don't need to be a Jedi to work out this is the cine-equivalent of the spoilt child who has to have the last word in an argument. It was still WRONG George, I don't care if the Gungan menace killed the Emperor himself. The central flaw in Clones is the relationship that should be its (and the series) emotional core, namely the relationship between Anakin and Padme. From the outset this is doomed on screen because of the casting of Hayden Christensen. His performance is so wooden and devoid of credibility that you might as well have hired the Gaffer's son and got him to read out the lines. We're asked to believe that this dull and stroppy teen will one day be the most feared man in the universe. So why does Padme fall in love with the little upstart? Lucas's script offers no clues. Anakin's diatribe on the failings of democracy should be enough to alarm any potential suteur but Padmes hardly bats an eyelid. She gets a another chance later after Anakin slaughters an entire tribe of Tusken Raiders but do any bulbs go off? Not a bit of it. Having proclaimed his murder of women and children the feckless former Monarch gives him a supportive hug! The problems of being attracted to a would-be fascist and murderer are offset, Lucas suggests, by the fact that Skywalker is good at rolling around in grass and making fruit float in the air, thus showcasing his playful qualities. We're left concluding that the most important couple in the galaxy came together because Padme is a sucker for a pretty face. Cynics may point to some evidence of misogyny here but in Lucas' defence this is the man who championed the role of women by putting Princess Leia in that slave girl two-piece. In any event Padme deserves everything she gets. Does the rest of the story fare any better? Sadly not. Obi Wan's journey to Kimino to visit a clone factory pushes story credibility to the limit. No one seems very alarmed by the prospect of entire army having being created in secret. Why should they you ask, the Jedi are in charge right? Wrong. Having being captured by Count Dooku the hapless Jedi is TOLD that Palpatine is the Emperor but dismisses it as dark side deception. Does no one think to check it out? Of course not and consequently only Yoda shows any common sense, only neglecting to mention his kidnap and replacement by a terrible puppet around the time of Menace. We're also treated to some moments of unintentional hilarity. Titter ye not at the Anakin blow job scene, and if you're watching toward the end try not to laugh when Yoda fights Dooku which looks like the Sith lord is trying to swat a giant fly. In contrast all the real jokes fail flat mostly, C3P0 the worst offender with some truly awful sub-Graham Norton punning that will make you wish you could disconnect your own head. Only Ewan McGregor in a more relaxed performance gets a good bit of deadpanning in with his caustic ""to get a drink"" response to Anakin's ""where are you going?"" question. So the romance is rushed and insubstantial - laced with some of the worst dialogue you'll hear in any language (""A litter piece of me dies each day"", yuk), and the Clone story fails to ignite due to lapses in plot logic and some flat delivery by the leads. On the plus side there are some nice set-pieces, though a little too cartoony is places, and a few crowd pleasing moments. All in all this is a better than before but not yet near the level set by the original trilogy. With only one film left to go there is a hell of a lot to be done (as well as a hell of lot of plot to get through) if this trilogy is to save face. Despite some attempts to improve, this is still the longest expositionary picture ever made. Skip it and watch the 2 minute scene in the original describing this period instead.

Oh dear, oh dear how can people who love film possibly defend this nonsense. The dialogue is as clunky as hell.

However, the film has some great special fx, does a good job with the story, and if you're into costumes, Natalie Portman where's a lot of them in this flick.

There is some pretty good stuff though. the lightsaber duels are awesome,Obi-Wan is awesome,the score is great and the story is pretty interesting.

If George Lucas was trying to make us feel sympathy with Anakin he failed miserably. While Luke may have been a bit whiny too he was never that bad. The end of the movie gets you all pumped up for the clone wars;which you don't get to see. Don't get me started on Anakin and Padme,they have next to no chemistry and I frankly could care less if they got together.

But the second movie was excellent (and did hold up). The teddy-bear movie was terrible, and episode 1 was really dull (although I kind of liked the character with the horns on his face). Anyway, I'd say this is not quite as good as the original Star Wars (episode 4, that is), although the acting is generally much better (and the production values incomparably so).

"Wow! ""Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" lives up to all of the hype and then some. This film improves on 1999's ""The Phantom Menace"" in the character and story department, though the acting is still a little flat. I was impressed with the performance of Hayden Christensen portraying Anakin Skywalker, we can see shades of the dark side in him. I was also pleased to see that Samuel L. Jackson was given more screen time, we still don't find out much about his character, Mace Windu, but it nice too see him have some significant screen time. This film explains more about the Star Wars  story than the last film did, the action in this film is phenomenal, there is a flying car chase which is breathtaking. The last 45 minutes of this film are the true standout, it is non stop action, the real highlight of the action and the film is when Yoda picks up a lightsaber and shows us why he is the Jedi master, it is truly awesome.

"Having waited impatiently for the new trilogy and being a trifle disappointed with The Phantom Menace, though I still watch it often - just to see if I've changed my mind, you understand, - I was a trifle apprehensive about Attack of the Clones, not least because I think it's a naff title. Still think it's a naff title but for the rest - thoroughly enjoyed it. Drawbacks - a couple of places looked too much like preparation for the computer game release, and I can't get past the whole Senator and whinghy Annie thing. Having said that, the love story was done as well as they could do it, I think. For me, best thing about the film was the underlying politics, who and what the Clones are - a surprise turn around there - wasn't expecting that. Also the Cloners themselves, very impressive. Was pleased the rumour about Obi-Wan being jealous of Annie over Amidala wasn't true.

"Well, following up after the phantom menace and I can say that the movie is consistently as good. But whats not consistent is the dated cgi and effects, I understand that its older, but the movie ranges from looking incredible to be absolutely horrid to look at. The plot is actually quite good, I like how it flows and pieces together to form one huge scale battle at the end which is the real highlight of the movie. The only part of the plot I didn't enjoy was Anakins and Padmes romance, its just downright bad. Shockingly dreadful dialogue and some mediocre acting don't do the film Well. The characters also aren't developed too much, only Anakin really is, which is alright. But again the movie all comes down to the ending which is spectacular to watch. Unlike the new star wars movies this one gets how to do action and especially lights aber fights...literally the most important part of star wars.

"The Phantom Menace was a disappointment, but still not bad. This would be terrible if there weren't some nice moments. First let me tell you about those. Ewan McGregor is even better now and also kinda sounds like Alec Guiness. That chase at the beginning was awesome, the part on that rainy planet even better, the meteorite scene similar to the one in The Empire Strikes Back, and some fights at the end would be great if the CGI wasn't so obvious in some parts. And also, while many people didn't like this new CGI Yoda, I really liked him and he's so cool, especially in that duel scene at the end. The first half of the movie is really slow and while the Obi-Wan part is good, the one with Anakin and Padme was awful. The part on Tatooine was okay and that is probably the only part of the movie where Hayden Christensen was decent. The dialogues are embarrassing in some scenes (I don't like sand) and someone should've told Lucas that he isn't writing a Shakespearian play! It's just so cringeworthy my face turned red. The romance between Anakin and Padme feels so fake and forced and so awfully done it made me lose faith in George Lucas. But he's the reason this franchise exists so I forgive him. The second half is a little bit faster, but my interest was already lost and I didn't even follow most of it. At least Jar Jar was only there for a few minutes. So, if there wasn't for some good action scenes this movie would suck. It's actually solid this way, but remains the worst movie in the franchise.",0.045596590909090906,0.5446969696969699

With the exception of light-sabre confrontations, the large battles scenes in the original 3 movies were alot more gripping. ",0.22572278911564628,0.6951955782312924

The fighting sequences are good with few breathtaking moments like the fight of Dooku with the two Jedi leading to Anakin losing his hand; entry of Master Yoda was also interesting. His fight with Dooku added colours. 
The Sith gain power and politics gaining strength and amidst this the Jedi council and the chosen one- Anakin----is he so? Many unanswered questions??",0.3409090909090909,0.5000000000000001

Overall, the movie is a well-crafted, intelligent, and worthy addition to the Star Wars canon.

George Lucas has made up for the sins of his past, redeeming himself for subjecting viewers to the awful Episode I: The Phantom Menace, a movie so bad I thought it might sink the whole Star Wars franchise. The latest instalment, I'm happy to say, is a marked improvement. It's not perfect, but at least Jar Jar Binks is kept to a minimum, and Yoda's transformation into a butt-kicking action hero is worth the price of admission alone. Torontonian Hayden Christensen is convincing as Anakin Skywalker, although falls a little flat in the love scenes with Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). Those scenes seem to be trying to emulate a 1930s mannered romance style of acting, but it doesn't really work here because there doesn't seem to be much chemistry between the two actors. The love story isn't the draw here anyway. Star Wars fans want elaborately staged action sequences, and in Episode II Lucas delivers. Early on there is an exciting chase through the night time skies of Coruscant, and the film's last 45 minutes have the kind of exhilaration and showmanship associated with the best moments from the original trilogy.",0.1575892857142857,0.512797619047619

"Yes - a legitimate Star Wars film that will look good on your shelf right beside the Original Trilogy.  Every movie has quibbles.  The fitful sleep scene may not play as intended.  I didn't mind the love story - there is no such thing as a romance that isn't cheesy.  It all serves a purpose.  Just seeing Mace Windu and Yoda in action is worth it.  This movie may very well prove that it is time for certain film critics to retire.

It seemed really easy for him to change faces from the good, modest boy to a person who had enough with Obi-Wan! Ironic, tender, obedient, angry, thoughtful, compassionate, charming,energetic but still cool, he could easily assume every feeling and emotionate state. I strongly believe that he's going to be a very big star! I've never seen a movie three days in the row but Hayden convinced me to!",0.24819078947368425,0.6480701754385966
"First off, if you are a Star Wars fan (as I am), this is a satisfying installment in the serial.  There's plenty of action, although it mostly occurs at the end, and the storylines are well developed through some exposition which may feel tedious to some.  Let's face it -- Star Wars is never going to be mistaken for Wagner's Ring cycle, or even Lord of the Rings, and it's not supposed to be ... it's supposed to be fun, and Clones is, much more so than Phantom Menace.",0.21875000000000003,0.4916666666666667

Star Wars: episode 2 - Attack of the Clones is set ten years after the the events of the Phantom Menace the Republic continues to be mired in strife and chaos. A separatist movement encompassing hundreds of planets and powerful corporate alliances poses new threats to the galaxy that even the Jedi cannot stem. Unfortunately this has to be the worst prequel movie. For some reason the lightsaber fights got tune down they are so bad to watch and the story wasn't as engaging as the Phantom Menace. The movie does have incredible CGI for it's time and Beautiful shots as always. The musical score is on point one of the best things of the movie. Ewan McGregor does a way better job playing Obi-Wan Kenobi. Hayden Christensen plays the older Anakin and unfortunately his acting is kinda bad in this movie especially when they are at Tatooine. Natalie Portman does a perfect job playing Padmé she bring a lot of initiative to her character. The best performance of the movie has to go to Christopher Lee as the menacing Count Dooku. Frank Oz as always is amazing as Yoda. And I have to give credit to Temuera Morrison as he plays a badass bounty hunter but he also plays every clone in the movie!

Add that to the fact I was rather disappointed with TPM and I was hoping for quite a lot from this movie.  Boy my expectations were blown out of the water.  I now consider this to be the best movie of the series.  I'm no little kid either, I saw ROTJ in the theater and I've been a fan since I could speak.  Everything that I ever wanted in a Star Wars movie was in Episode 2.  I realize many critics and non-fans simply won't get this movie or completely misunderstand the ""love"" story, but that's okay by me.  Many people felt the same way about Empire Strikes Back.

In other words just because you CAN do a thing, doesn't mean you necessarily SHOULD do it. Allow me to digress: Spielberg's ""A.I."" was a good example. By Spielberg's own admission, had he found a way to make the shark work, he would have used it more in ""Jaws"". Instead of the classic atmospheric and suspensful film ""Jaws"" is, it would have been closer to a B-movie. Sometimes your limitations FORCE you te be creative.

A must see for all STAR WARS fans young and old. Even if you are 875 years old like Yoda !!!!!! The only part of the movie that dissapointed me was that I read the book first and the actual movie didn't start till about chapter 3 or 4 of the hardback edition of this movie. Christopher Lee was great as Count Dooku a.k.a. Darth Tyrannus. I loved seeing Boba Fett as a kid. Plus the best scene in the whole movie was when Yoda uses a lightsaber. He is pretty good for being 875 and only 2 feet tall!! Plus really get to see how Anakin starts to become Vader! I can hardly wait till 2005 which is when people are saying episode 3 will be out!                    Long live the Force! P.S.

"My brother once asked me, ""What is Attack of the Clones"" about. My answer: ""It's about two hours and 20 minutes too long."" While I hoped that George Lucas might push the reset button and go back to telling a story about characters we cared about, my hopes were dashed when Star Wars Attack of the Clones. There have been several attempts on Amidalla's (Natalie Portman) life. The attacks continue when she returns to Corsuscant to meet two old friends: Ben Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christianssen). They go after one attempted assassin who turns out to be Jango Fett, the father of Boba. Curious, Ben Kenobi does an investigation that leads him to a distant world in which an alien race has created an army of clones under the direction and dealing of a former Jedi, Dooku. This way, the Empire can now have a standing army. The template is based on Jango Fett (so I guess he was a lousy shot with a blaster?). Meanwhile, Anakin and Padme go to her home world of Naboo and start to fall in love. Anakin starts to resent the Jedi order as he feels Kenobi is not treating him well. He returns to Tatooine to visit his mother. She has been kidnapped by the Tusken Raiders and Anakin finds her just as she dies. He goes berserk. Returning to Padme, he confides in her and their loves grows. They decide to find Ben Kenobi on the planet of Geonosis, home world of the Trade Federation. Through a series of events, all three survive a battle droid factory, are put in an arena with large, mean alien animals, and join a large Jedi battle against the Trade Federation. Joining them are the new clone troops. This eventually leads to Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) where Anakin, Kenobi, and Yoda all do their best with their Light Sabers, but come up short. My first gripe was the pacing of the plot: slow. Moreover, the exposition usually resides in people sitting and talking to let the audience know its plot points. My second gripe was the acting coupled with the worst dialog since Captain Kirk's monologues in the TV version of Star Trek. In fact, Christianssen's lame acting rivals that of Shatner, although the latter was usually tongue-in-cheek about it. There is absolutely no chemistry between Anakin and Padme. Again, we have epic characters who don't care, because the actors do not care. It boils down again to Lucas who cares more about sets and special effects instead of telling a story. As a matter of fact, I found this one the most boring of the entire franchise. I struggled in staying awake at a point in this movie. Even worse, I felt like leaving at one point, but stayed thinking ""This might get better."" I was wrong. At least the light saber battle in Phantom Menace provided a little bit of entertainment because it was truly different and innovative.

"What can be said about this movie that has not already been uttered? I will try my best.   Once again, as with The Phantom Menace, the critics are fairly divided.  This time, however, the fans seem pleased.  I, myself, enjoyed phantom very much.  Still, ATOC is more like the original films than phantom was.  The acting is overal good.  Hayden (Anakin) does a fine job, especially in the scene with Padme after the Tuskin slaughter.  Portman is OK.  She is a little too reserved for my taste, but that is what the character is like.  The real star of the movie is Yoda.  He simply steals the show at the end.  It is so remarkable that Yoda is all CG.  No critic seems to acknowledge this accomplishment.  The story is very complelling. I love how Lucas adds the sleuth element to film, a first for SW.  Visaully, Lucas proves once again that he is still the Master.  The images in every frame are potent enough to tell the story without dialog.  Perhaps that is why some dislike this film?  Once again, we see various elements that influenced Lucas cascading across the screen such as Dex's Diner and so forth.  Also, the design are remarably familar.  This allows the foreign worlds such as Corusant to have relevance to us.  In the end, Lucas has created a great old style sci fi flick with state of the art design and technology.  As a side note, I am really sick and tired of the comparisons to Lord of the rings and Peter Jackson.  Fellowship was great, but remember unlike Lucas, Jackson takes no creative risk in LOTR.  Jackson has one of the greatest stories to work with.  The environments and much of the dialog are already laid out.  Lucas has to do ALL OF IT!!",0.2790406162464987,0.5362535014005602
The strength of the early star wars films was the novelty and the acting. The heavy reliance on CGI for episodes 1 and 2 mean that the acting has taken second place and there is no novelty value as we know how the story turns out and there are very few new characters in episode 2.,-0.06701704545454545,0.25900568181818184
"I finally had to come to defense of both this and EP I.  First off, its George's creation, not the internet fans'.  People need to understand that its a Saga and not individual films.  Go back and watch the original and tell me you can't see the Anakin we got to know in EpII behind the black mask.  Especially at the climax of ROTJ.  People killed the Anakin in EPI because ""the dark lord would never say yippee"".  People he's 8. Back to EPII.  As a film, no its not great.  Only ANH can be classified a great film.  Hayden did a great job, and acted like any other 20 year old when faced against authority.  Natalie Portman was a little off, but maybe her role called for her to be restrained as she is a politician as well as a former Queen.  Ewan was by far the best and you can totally see him as the older gentleman we meet in ANH.  I've noticed that the rating for this film has actually gone up over the last month.  It was also named best film of the summer on another site.  I think people are realizing it for what it is. Just a small chapter in a much larger book that is the creation of George Lucas and therefore they have learned to enjoy it. I have been a SW fan for most of my life and I can't help but feel like a kid again when I watch all 5 movies.   I guess those of you who say you can't forgive him for this movie won't be lining up to see EpIII in 3 years.",0.12041666666666667,0.46972222222222226
"Overall, I enjoyed Episode II but if the whole series of six films is to gel, then Episode III must be better. In my opinion, episodes 1, 2, 4 and 5 (forgetting Return of The Jedi for a moment), each get better than the one before. Therefore, the first is pretty average; the second much better; the fourth (the 'original') better still; and the fifth (Empire) the best, in my opinion. Then it deteriorates with 'Jedi', but only back to the standard of 'Clones', which is very good. The main flaw in this new episode is that the film is just too long. Twenty minutes shaved off could have tightened it up a heck of a lot, but it does drag in the middle. I agree with a lot of reviewers that the love affair between Annakin and Padme are drawn out. The thing that saves it is the haunting music of John Williams, which I feel is his best in the series. But I have heard it said that when you start to really listen to a film's score whilst watching the movie, your attention is waning. That aside, the majority of the movie is good fun. At last, I enjoyed Ewan McGregor's performance. He is the mainstay of this in a similar, but not as superb, way that Harrison Ford was in the earlier movies. Unlike others, I didn't actually like Christopher Lee in this. It follows too hot on the heels of his part in the 'Rings' film. The flaws are outweighed by some great action and inventive set-pieces. And C3PO is very funny. I'm glad he turned up when he did. And finally, in the face of some terrible dialogue, Natalie Portman is shaping up to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. Hard to believe that someone so plain as Princess Leia could be produced by her! 7 out of 10. Episode 3 needs to be even better to justify three prequels.",0.2649682232660957,0.4933515243621626

"I went to this film not believing that It would be much better than Episode I, MAN! was I in for a PLEASENT SURPRISE! this film rocked. I  always felt like Episode I felt more like a spin-off film rather than A true Star Wars film, NOT TRUE with Episode II. now this IS Star Wars. It did remind me of ""The 5th Element"" toward the begining of the film during the Skycar chase sceen. And this film did slow down into two halves, the OBI-WON half which is a detective(who dunnit) story line--and the other half of this film is the Anikin half wich is a slow sweeping love story. The Actor playing Anikin is perfect for his role. George Lucas redeemed both himself and the Star Wars franchise with this film. My only complaint is that the tital ""Attack of the Clones"" is mis-leading because the clones are the good guys helping the Jedi to fight a Droid Army. I thing a better tital would have been ""Jedi Master Yoda Kicks Ass""--because that was one of the highlights of this film for me(everyone in the movie theater busted out laughing and at the same time cheering during Yoda's fight scene-it was great!).I will probably see this film at leat 2 more times while it is still showing at the theater, and now I thinking of watching Episode I  all over again.

"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones' can best be described as a transitional film in which we are right in the middle of the ultimate conversion from good to evil. Hayden Christensen is not miscast as the hormone infused Anakin Skywalker who treads on love with Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). Episode II' seems to improve upon the needed improvements that were so pervasive in Episode I'.      That being said, it still has its' flaws. Director George Lucas embeds his film with digital imagery that exhausts the viewer. I have comes to term with this trait that I only experience when watching these Star Wars' films (Episode I & 2) and have keenly labeled the concept Visual Exhaustion'. This is because Lucas puts 95% of the film through a digital filter. To some this can be an alluring trait, but in my personal opinion it seems as if he has come to rely wholeheartedly on digital imagery to convey a story. This was the severe case that we encountered upon Episode I. The hype surrounding that film was maniacal and had many people; including myself, disappointed with the first foray into the Galactic Tale that we had so eagerly awaited. Yet, in Episode II, we see Lucas actually focusing on telling a story and although the story might not as be as interesting as the later chapters are (Episode 4, 5, 6) we still are captivated by the young Hayden Christensen. This virtually unknown actor inhibits several characteristics that will lead into the third part which I will be anxiously awaiting. I must admit, I was severely turned off by Episode I' and wanted to loathe this film, but Lucas seems to have revamped the franchise and has focused on telling a story and not selling toys. Good move George, you have partially restored some integrity back into the franchise.      Improvements are seen in the overall design of the film. The plot involves some more origins being uncovered as an assassination attempt on Senator Amidala leads to a civil war in the galaxy as Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) attempts at destroying the Galaxy through a separatist movement. This in turn forces the Senate to develop an army in order to ensure safety as there are not enough Jedi for thorough protection. The clones in question are the Storm Troopers we see in future films under the Direct Command of Lord Vader.      Confused yet? You should be. I always thought Lucas complicated his scripts by tackling too much content as back story and there is no difference here. Trade Wars, Colonies and Separatists are all part of this plot that leads into one pivotal event  the conversion of young Skywalker to the dark side. What I found interesting was the manner in which the film cleverly foreshadowed the events to come surrounding young Skywalker. Perhaps foreshadowing is not the best word to use since we all know of Skywalker's fate, but during the film we see clever scenarios that display the innate rage, madness and anger this young Jedi possesses. Skywalker's progress as a young man is a crucial element in this film as we are exposed to his much darker side that really spotlights him as a trouble-maker. Skywalker is slowly becoming disenchanted with the Rules a Jedi must follow and finds himself falling out of favor with his Masters. This in turn leads to a slow, yet gradual progression towards the Dark Side. It must be noted that Episode II is far superior to Episode I. As aforementioned, it does have its' flaws specifically in terms of dialogue. Yet it is also clear that Lucas had the script somewhat doctored for cohesiveness; something that was missing in Episode I. Writer Jonathan Hales (The Scorpion King) was called upon to clear some points but the dialogue still suffers as we are in for some of the weakest romantic dialogue in a long time. The interplay between Skywalker and Amidala is gushing with uncomforting romance as these two characters plot out their love and their lives.      Lucas opens the film with a great action sequence involving the pursuit of an assassin which is extremely entertaining. The sets in the introductory sequence seem to be lifted from Spielberg's A.I.' as the dizzying lights and glamour of a Galactic city come to life. This interesting action sequence seemingly sets the tone for what is a visually exhausting yet solid attempt at getting the franchise in the direction which it should be headed. Lucas uses the same transitional progression as he did with the later chapters in terms of pace and character development. Episode II' serves to hopefully build towards a cataclysmic and dark third piece that resolves all. Yet, the stereotypical Alien characters are back in full force and the pounding score from musical genius John Williams accompanies this tale that is a step ahead from Episode I,  but a few steps back from the magic that was Star Wars'.",0.07706155632984897,0.4140534262485481
"I've seen review after review slamming this movie (as well as Episode I)and finally decided I had to say something. Everyone keeps comparing them to the original trilogy.

"Star Wars: Attack of the Clones gets the big 6 for me. While this movie was not good enough to be put up on the throne of excellence with the original Star Wars, I put this as a good popcorn flick. We have a good story but this film results in hits and misses. Big hits include Jengo Fett, Boba was my favorite character from the original trilogy and Jengo was a nice return to the Fett character, the battle with Mace Windu in the Colosseum, the battle with Yoda and Dooku... for a little guy that jedi could move, and the speed racer race between Anakin and Obi to find the evil female assassin through the city. Now here are the misses. I hated the love sequences between Padme and Anakin I nearly fell asleep, not enough Jengo Fett, not enough Mace Windu and his cool lightsabre, and it seems George Lucas wants to bore us to tears to enjoy this film. Sure he made a better movie than Phantom Menace but that's not saying much.I don't get why we don't see Dooku till the end. I liked the performance made by Christopher Lee as Dooku, only wishing there was more of him. With Star Wars- Attack of The Clones, you have to tell yourself that this is of the new trilogy.

"This movie is MUCH better than the first episode.  Here are some pros and a few cons with this movie: PROS: 1. Jar Jar Binks gets VERY LITTLE screen time this time.  That is GOOD.  I think Mr. Lucas did listen to all the comments he got from viewers of EP1, and toned him down A LOT.  Makes the movie SO much better. 2. Yoda was AWESOME.  I loved the computer effects.  I loved the fact that he kicked some MAJOR ass.  I also liked his calming force in the movie.  He is clearly the most powerful Jedi on the council.  This was even apparent in EP1, and it really shows this time. 3. The Visuals were truly AWESOME.  The different places that the movie took us to were just stunning.  The different creatures that were put in were very cool too. 4. This is of course expected, but the special effects were just great.  The computer effects were outstanding.  I really liked the race in the city. That was cool. 5. There was NO mention of ""mediclorians.""  Another big plus.  Seems Mr. Lucas heard the fans on that one too. 6. This makes EP1 quite a bit more understandable.  This movie also answered several of my questions from the first three films (parts 4, 5, and 6). 7. Natalie Portman is just stunning.  She was kind of reserved and held back a bit in EP1.  But, for this movie, she is powerful and well used.  And she is just such a BABE.",0.32906317031317034,0.5873058773058771

"Attack Of The Clones continues the story from 1999's THE PHANTOM MENACE-Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan Mcgregor) is now a Jedi Master, Anakin Skywalker(Hayden Christensen) is his Padawan, and Queen Amidalia(Natalie Portman) has decided to take Palpatine's place as the Senator from her home planet. However, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine(Ian Mcdiarmid), AKA ""Darth Sidious"" is up to no good, and is playing both sides in a galactic conflict between his Republic and the ""Seperatists"", led by Count Dooku(Christopher Lee) who is secretly working for Palpatine to start a war-the Clone Wars mentioned briefly in the original STAR WARS. AOTC attempts to address many of PHANTOM's flaws. There's less Jar-Jar, the henchman this time have a lot more to do and say, there's no scatological humor and the film is a lot more darker in tone. The film is also more visually and thematically linked to the original trilogy. However, there are still flaws. The two leads-Hayden and Natalie-give cringeworthy performances, and the love dialogue they're given to say doesn't help.(This is perhaps more Lucas's fault than theirs-both stars have been good actors in other films). Ewan Mcgregor, as Obi-Wan, tries to do his best but he's mainly stuck with bad wisecracks and exposition dialogue. The best performances come from returning old trilogy actors-Daniels(C-3PO) Oz(Yoda) and Mcdiarmid(Palpatine) as well as Christopher Lee(Who also plays a slightly similar villain in the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy) and Temura Morrison, who plays the ""father"" of the Stormtrooopers and Boba Fett. The direction is OK-Lucas's transitions and edits are a little better here than in TPM, but still are very sloppy, especially in the film's final battle sequences, which fail to capture the suspense of the similar ground battle in ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The special FX range from excellent to poor...particuarly with the Clonetroopers, who look excellent when we see one or two, but are obviously cut-and-pasted in assembly shots in the middle and end of the film.

"'Star Wars - Episode II, Attack of the Clones' is a really silly movie. Since there is no interesting story, Lucas spends so much time on silly car chases and light saber battles. Its basically like watching a blank screen for two hours. The dialog is laughably bad, and I've seen better acting on soap operas. I'm not kidding. The characters may be the same from the originals, but they do not bring the passion or excitement they once did. Yoda is now just a computer-generated graphic. The mysteriousness of Darth Vader has now been destroyed too, thanks to bad acting by a child and a teenager. And thanks to some pitiful dialog and clumsy storytelling. The ""plot"" is about assassinations attempts on Queen Amidila, who spends the entire movie looking pretty and saying cornball dialog. After some political babble about the Republic, which really doesn't go anywhere, Obi-won-Konobi goes out on a hunt to find who is behind the scheme. He finds out it was Jango Fett, father of Boba Fett. Then he finds out a planet is making a army of clones. On the other side of the story, Annakin and Amidila are falling in love. Annakin then tries to find his mother. His mother is killed and he then kills an entire village of people. He is slowly going into the ""dark"" side. I would have cared if the acting wasn't so bad and the screenplay wasn't so wooden. There is no heart in the story. It looked like it was put together without any effort or passion. It is slightly better than 'Episode I', but nowhere near as good as the originals.

"This movie, attack of the clones, is not very good. It has a confusing plot, bad writing, AWFUL dialogue, OK acting, and horrible character work. Everything about the movie that is at least semi-good has an asterisk next to it. The final lightsaber duel with yoda vs dooku is cool in theory, but Dooku is super out of place and Yoda's character is blatantly Assasinated. Yoda works best when he is A wise, peaceful sage dedicated to peace. We should never hear Yoda say ""concentrate your fire on the nearest starship"" that completely ruins Yoda in episode 5 and 6 when you realize that he commanded an army in a war, he no longer stays as a passive, peaceful sage, he's more like a Knight than a teacher, and that is HORRIBLE. Another problem with this movie is the plot. THIS MOVIE MAKES NO SENSE. Okay, lemme run through the overall plot of the movie. So the title crawl tells us that the Jedi are ""overwhelmed"" by the separatists. How? There is no mention of battle droid attacks, it's literally just a group with separate political views. So, palpatine wants to make an army so he can control 2 armies from behind the scenes, but Padmè is here and she wants to vote against making an army, so he has to kill her. But he doesn't want to do it himself, so he asks Dooku to do it. But Dooku doesn't want to do it, so he asks Jango fett to do it. But Jango doesn't want to do it, so he asks his friend to do it, but his friend doesn't want to do it so she sends a droid to do it, and if you really wanna get Granial about it, THE DROID SENDS BUGS TO GO KILL PADME. ""Secretly genius these movies are"" yeah right. Even Obi-wan, my favorite Star Wars character, is a complete idiot in this movie. He goes to Kamino and finds out that all the clones are made from Jango Fett's DNA, and later, he finds out that Dooku and Jango are friends. So, rationally, Obi-wan would be able to figure out a connection between Dooku and the army right, possibly finding out this is a trick and maybe saving the WHOLE GALAXY.

But despite a defective plot, clunky dialogue and visual effects light-years behind the new series of films, back in 1977 it was fresh and astonishing, far more so than Episodes I and II. Now everyone knows what is possible with CGI and expects to see dazzling visual effects. And Episode II delivers. Alas, the pedestrian plot and banal dialogue are not enough to lift the film above the flashiness of the visual effects. In fact, the effects are SO dazzling that they seem cartoonish: Everything is so fast-paced and so much is happening on the screen at once that it is difficult to appreciate the spectacle. The gladiatorial sequence near the end is a triumph of special effects, but they are too reminiscent of the recent film `Gladiator'.

I am as huge a fan as the next guy, but I won't let my love for something I've known since I was 2 yrs old blind me to what I experienced when I saw Episode II. I've never believed that Lucas was a great director. Seeing this movie drives that home.  Way back when, in fact, I did not like the idea that he would be directing these prequels.  McGregor, Jackson and Portman are awesome performers but Lucas can turn any talented actor/actress into what looks like an amateur reading their lines off cue cards for the first time. The performances were awful.  (Lucas's fault) I was trying to get into the story, but I just wasn't feeling it.  The screenplay was just totally erratic.  The movie had no flow what so ever. As a fan of Star Wars, I honestly tried really hard to find something in this movie that I liked.  I couldn't.  The only satisfaction I have now is that I'm one step closer in the story to seeing how Anakin comes to be Vader.  I really can't even say this movie had a plot or a story.  It was just a sequence of events.  I think that Lucas takes for granted what the audiences all ready know about the outcome of Anakin's demise.  This is a big mistake on Lucas's part.

"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, is a contender for Episode V's coveted 'Best Star Wars Film' title. The film is magnificent, marks the coming of age of CGI and tows the line Lucas set down in his endeavour to create a new mythology for generation x. When Lucas references his earlier work and the work of those who influenced him, he conjures visual wonder. With the depreciation of the Jedi in the eyes of the republic, we have a new interpretation of the delapidation of the samurai of feudal Japan Kurosawa worked wonders with. The cityscape of Coruscant is a knowing nod at 'Blade Runner', with Ridley Scott further referenced. He's there in the gladiatorial arena on Geonosia and the descent of the clone carriers upon the same planet - those snazzy 'hand-held' shots were a treat. The latter reminded the audience of 'Black Hawk Down', as well as the ride of the valkyries in Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now'.",0.13807303807303806,0.3342463092463092

"Episode II. I tried to put episode I behind me and hoped it was a misstep. Episode II is not a terrible movie. On it's own it is pretty good. But the problem is, is it's not a good Star Wars movie. From the opening scene where the senator and her bodyguard are getting off the ship and he says something like 'Looks like we're out of danger' and then the bombs go off is just bad writing. Why telegraph the scene like that? The original Star Wars movies had nuance, feeling, and most of all a sense of foreboding and darkness that is almost completely gone in the first two installments (I and II) It seems Lucas is relying so heavily on comic relief and levity (Jar Jar, The flying thing that owns Anakin and his mom, and a host of other characters) that the feeling is lost. You really dont get a sense that this brat is going to be one of the most feared villians in movie history one day! Christianson, as Ani, is stiff and delivers his lines like he is reading off of cue cards. There really is no spark between he and Amidala, and the love scenes really gum up the works slowing the movie down when it should be gaining speed. The best scenes are those with obi wan (Mcgregor) and Jango Fett. They both have acting chops and have a fun duel. It was nice to see the beginnings of Boba Fett, a fan favorite. Once again, Lucas feels that the CGI characters are the wave of the future. Well, they may be, but until they flesh them out better they still look fake! In ROTJ, Jabba looked great because he was actually there! It was a puppet and looked great! As did the rest of the characters. Sam Jackson is good but his lines are so clunky its almost embarrasing. Some fun action scenes but most are catered to the kids in the audience, which wouldnt be so bad if there werent many adults who love the movies also!

Now I understand that you can't ""eat principles"", but with over a billion dollars earned from his earlier films, it doesn't appear that our friend George is starving. The story is only marginally better than Phantom Menace's, however little that is saying, and nearly all of the actors deliver extremely weak performances. Christopher Lee, a notable exception, still shouldve turned this one down. His ""Count Dooku"" role was misconceived and seemed designed solely for the purpose of including a well-respected, Alec Guinness-like British star. Even more disturbing, despite the urgings of fans far more devoted than I, Lucas still hasn't transferred the directorial and screenwriting reins to more capable professionals (as he had the one-time good sense to do in Empire Strikes Back) and concentrate on what he knows: storywriting and props.

With every new trailer that dropped over the next few months, my eagerness to see the movie grew to the point that it was all I talked about so in May of 2002, me, my parents and my brother went to go see Attack of The Clones and after the end credits rolled, I was gobsmacked by what I had just watched. Much like The Phantom Menace before it, I simply adored Attack of The Clones and I remember watching it many more times. However, as I grew older I began to hear that the film was even worse than The Phantom Menace and I was taken aback as I loved the movie for what it was and had seen nothing wrong with it apart from it's long-winded run time but upon rewatching Attack of The Clones in preparation for seeing Episode 9 later this year, I found it to be a tedious and boring film when it came to the story, running time, dialog and the characters while I was entertained by the action, musical score and some of the acting.",-0.006680440771349866,0.38992522628886267

"Infinitely better than the last outing, but that's still damning it with faint praise.  To be fair, there are some wonderful moments here: the thrilling bounty hunter chase through Coruscant; Obi-Wan and Jango's rain-soaked one-on-one; and the chillingly vicious Lightsaber Round Robin finale  Yoda's 'Matrix'-style moves notwithstanding.  Jar Jar is mercifully relegated to the minor (and rather apt) role of unwitting traitor, and Christopher Lee brings some much needed gravitas to the whole affair. Though the story drags in places, it's reasonably well-structured, balancing the action with the necessary (though soggy) romance.  And the motivation for Anakin's descent into evil is credible, even if Hayden Christensen's performance isn't.  Yet, once again, Lucas sabotages what could have been his masterpiece with what is now clearly a CGI-obsession bordering on clinical insanity.  Entire sequences, such as the droid assembly line (Coming soon to a Playstation near you!) and the 'Gladiator'-inspired arena battle, are plainly motivated by nothing more than the desire to do something cool with effects.  But they aren't cool.  They're mind-numbingly boring.  The climactic battle between droids and clones is so self-consciously spectacular that the audience is left feeling more alienated than engaged.  Sure, CGI played a role in every scene in this film  even the ones I loved.  But that wasn't what I loved about them.  For me, it was one or two of the humans who nearly saved the day.

On the Biography channel, he mentions that he was frustrated with the technology of the 70's and had to do episode four first due to the limited special effects of the day.  With SkyWalker Ranch cranking out the effects for him, he has truly blurred reality and fiction in this fine film.  The build up for the Clone wars is excellent and seeing Boba as a kid is cool. Way better than episode One.  The character interaction is better than Episode One and the romance between Amadala and Anakin is realistic.  This movie has been criticized for a flat performance in the romance section. Critics don't remember those early years of awkwardness and role finding. I definitely want to see this movie again.

"My oh my, what have we got here? (some spoilers among the ramblings)  I thought this was gonna be the one'. You know the Episode that knocks my socks off Well I'm still wearin' my Wilson over-the-calf crews I was rather disappointed in this installment of the series. I think I may be in a vast minority here but I actually liked Ep.I better. There seemed to be a lot more going on story-wise. You could see an arch building to reach Ep. IV. I thought it was very interesting. All except for (again casting myself into the minority) the pod-race scene: it held no excitement for me. We know that Anakin is going to grow up to be Darth Vader so where's the threat of him dying in a pod-race? But we're here to talk about Ep. II, aren't we? Well I know my 2cents is coming in a little late, but I had to get this off my chest(**spoilers ahead**)deep breath, here goes. I'm not lacking in the appreciation of a good romance, but enough with the forbidden love stuff already we know they get together. get it over with and get on with the story. Get on with Anakin becoming the Dark Lord of the Sith. We only have one more Episode left, don't waste it! You could be explaining so much, like who the Sith are and why we should be afraid of them. Instead we get sexual tension. Ok, but we know they get together! We could be seeing the clone war and where that leads us or the construction of the Death Star or even more (spoilers) Yoda kickin some serious butt. But no, we get the young lovers rolling around in the grass for Pete's sake! What about Shmi? That whole part was so unfulfilling. Like, Hi, Mom' uchhh dead. Then, oh then, we only HEAR about what he did at the Tuskin Raider camp! I mean jeez, get on with the meat of the story. The battle between good and evil.  We KNOW THEY GET TOGETHER! But I digress or have digressed enough for one day. Hey, there were some good moments, right? (And I stress moments). Like, there were a couple tense scenes where you just knew this was when Anakin was gonna loose that hand!. And then there were the jokes like, Anakin is going to be the death of me.' That was good.. and of courseYoda. All hail Master Yoda! Yeah. So, in summary: as I think I've illustrated here, I believe too much time was spent on a plot line that held no suspense or mystery and a digression from one that began this whole ADVENTURE. Was this much time spent on Han and Leia's courtship in Empire, which still remains the best installment in the Star Wars saga for me? I think not.  But I'm beginning to digress again.

"I believed that this film still shows us that George Lucas still has a passion for this epic.  His love and devotion is on course, but it would appear that he sometimes he can't ""see the forest for the trees"". Like many, I found the beginning rather pedantic in it's ability to draw the observer into something emotional, but rather attempted to dazzle us with effects. In my opinion, Lucas has so developed his scope and concept for the films attitude, that he forgot to allow one very special thing to happen: Allow the actors to act. I got teary-eyed at some of the action scenes rather than the development of sympathies and antipathies involving the character development.  There is where the trees go in the way.

"Now i know why this movie got remade into an animated flick. it would be less irritating as a result. Where to start? first off, this movie is really boring. ignoring the fact that in space, shootings will make no sound, the spacecrafts are so cheesy and convoluted. cheesy moments between padme and Annie, Yoda saying wise crap, etc. half-hearted attempts made on the senator's life (if people like presidents and singers can get assassinated, much easier a senator can be), its just so clichéd! Then the acting abilities. Annie is just a pretty face. He screws up his face to act emo and evil. He has no emotions. He sounds fake when talking about how much he love Padme. Natalie Portman doesn't look like she can do yoga, much less fight, she's too skinny. Annie's mother's death scene is so fake! The evil cloner guy's son also can't act, he smiles evilly, but didn't pull it off. The plot is almost nonexistent. In fact, you could fast forward to the last hour and not miss anything. All the best ridiculous action are there. You see Yoda whizzing like a bullet, that's classic! Im not really a star wars fan, but i respect the intense amount of work put into the old movies. But this movie reeks of cheesiness, be warned! P.S. The music is too loud, and the talking are soft. Bad combination. The music also swells cheesily whenever Padme talk with Annie.

The acting is certainly upgraded from the previous Star Wars movie, with Anakin being the more emotional and hate filled adult who has many conflicting emotions including the fear of losing his loved ones, his secret love for Padme and the hatred and anger that develops throughout the film, thereby following word for word Yoda's teachings of Episode's I and V.

"I don't understand the complaints about how the dialog is poorly written and the acting is wooden. These are Star Wars trademarks. Have any of these people watched the first three movies at all?

Sure the hour after the Coruscant chase is anywhere from talky to boring, but look at the bright point of this all: Less Jar-Jar and no Jake Lloyd. When Jar-Jar is on screen, he's helping out the bad guy. Then the movie becomes a lot of fun. The end fight scenes have a lot of stuff happening and it's awesome. The best part about this movie is that it avoids having like 3 different battles happening at once and it sticks to one at a time. It goes from having the arena battle, to the attack of the clones, to the fight with Dooku. The previous two movies had too many battles happening once. Going from one battle, to the next then another one then cutting back to them again. Then Yoda comes along and steals the movie and makes just his 5 minutes in the sun worth the price of admission alone. The best part about this movie is that it sets up the next one perfectly.

"Overall, there is no doubting that Episode II : Attack of the Clones is a lot more complete and well rounded than Epusode I : The Phantom Menace. This film is very interesting for the fact that it is the first time you see the jedi as more than a dying order with all but a few members left. In the movie you witness them in the prime of their order and it truly is an awesome display, especially when the clone troopers arrive to back them up. Also, this movie shoes why Yoda is the head Jedi Master ;) Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the movie is Anakin Skywalker. In the original trilogy we hardly knew anything of Anakin from his past life aside from he was a great jedi and general of the republic who simply succumbed to the dark side. Throughout the movie it is very obvious that the internal struggle that is going on inside of Anakin, he is torn between the light and dark sides of the force. He is a good person with a great heart but there are certain things that set him off where he loses control of his emotions. One of these include being held back by his master Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Jedi Order, who are reluctant to give him his Jedi Trial despite of how skillful he is. To give you an idea of how powerful he is, after a mere 10 years of Jedi training he outperforms and last longer in a fight with the main villain of the movie Count Dooku than Obi-Wan does despite Obi-Wan having well over 20 years of Jedi training and him being a master Jedi. The main conflict that Anakin seems to be confronted with is his love affair with Padme and how it is against the Jedi code. The movie has its romantic parts but Lucas doesn't overkill it so don't worry, it's actually a pleasant change compared to Episode I which was devoid of any such feelings. Overall, this movie delivers, it has good solid acting, awesome special effects, and a great story. This is up there with Empire and Jedi for me, it really is that good and a must see for any Star Wars fan or even casual movie-goer.",0.2154285714285714,0.46983333333333344
"What can I say that has not already been said? First off, many people love to bash this movie because they loath George Lucas. They say that it does not compare to A New Hope or Empire. Well, maybe it doesn't. But perhaps part of the reason for this is simply that many of us were young impressionable children in 1977 or 1980 and so we were more likely to be overwhelmed by a picture (any picture) than we are today.",0.27626262626262627,0.5161135161135161
"I was very pleased with Star Wars Episode II.  The action scenes were very good and the special affects were first rate.  Everything fit very nicely with the other films.  It was very obvious that Lucas has taken great pains to make sure the film fit with the rest and did not contradict the each other.  This made the film very enjoyable.  If you are a stickler for detail, I would advise that you see all of the other Star War's movies again before you see this one and concentrate on the small things.  There are a lot of little hints here and there that you may not pick up if you don't have the other films fresh in your mind. ",0.27156015037593983,0.5554553049289892

Anakin has to be one of the most unlikebale character on celluloid. Is anyone going to care when this kid goes bad? No way. Let him have it. I can't stand him.

From a technical standpoint it is superb (although I'm sure I prefer a puppet-Yoda to a CGI-Yoda).  It does have a few magnificent action scenes.  Its not what you'd call a ""fun"" movie, though.  The original 1977 STAR WARS (""Episode 4"") film was fun, as was RETURN OF THE JEDI and THE PHANTOM MENACE.  ATTACK OF THE CLONES fits in better with EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and is a very dark film.  (How this movie didn't get a PG-13 is a mystery up there with the Kennedy Assassination and Jack the Ripper.)  It has doses of humor, action, and fun, but those elements are overshadowed by the suspense and mystery of it.

Padme also is very unpleasant young woman and with ALL good guys annoying the movie loses much. The love story between Anakin and Padme is horrible. It is pathetic, slow and cheesy and I personally hope that awful things will happen to these two in the next installment. However, the movie has its strong moments and they are delivered by the bad guys. Darth Sidious proved again his malice and cunning characters, Jango Fet was extremely cool and count Dookoo, played by the legend Christopher Lee is simply the best.

"I was honestly surprised by 'Attack of the Clones'. It was so disappointing, even after 'The Phantom Menace', that I could hardly believe what I was seeing. There are no characters, just a few caricatures wandering around the galaxy and waiting to do something. The extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation, and that's about it. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes just began on their own, coming from nowhere with a booming, albeit good, John Williams soundtrack. While I was watching this movie I kept asking ""Where is this happening? What's going on?"" The acting was high school drama quality, with stiff wooden delivery, as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines. Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by the overwhelming special effects. Most of the film looked like it was recorded in front of a green screen. The actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks, looking almost robotic in their movements. So, these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios, often without even the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they're there. This was happening, now that's happening. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a bit of fun watching it at home. Definitely can't hold a candle to the original trilogy, though.",0.0620238095238095,0.45642857142857146
Attack of the Clones can be summed up in two statements:,0.0,0.0
"Let me say this as a springboard for the rest of this review: I still don't buy the Annakin becomes Vader story. Lucas stated that these two persons were distinct individuals, not the same person, way back in the summer of 1977. Watch A New Hope and listen to Ben talk about Vader and Luke's Father and you'll hear it. Yoda also speaks of two different people in Empire. I choose to believe them. So what happened? Lucas changed his story after Empire to please the fans, and all the myth building went into the toilet. That brings us to the latest episode from Lucas. In 1977 and again in 1980, Lucas made two films that sucked me into their world and took me for an incredible ride. It was a ride I was glad to go on many times. Clones sucked also, but in a completely different way. I don't know whether it was the sucky dialogue, the bad acting or the lousy story that turned me off within five minutes. I was not involved at all in the film. I was so tempted to speak back at the screen a dozen times or more, but my wife kept pinching me just as those moments happened. I slipped once, when Annakin asked Sen. Armadillo, `Are you suffering like I am?' I screamed, `Yes, we are.' This brought cheers from the audience. The audience, by the way, sat in stunned silence as the suckieness unfolded. Everything was wrong with this film. Only Christopher Lee and Obi-Wan brought any class to this dreck. It just plain sucked, in more ways than I have room here to relate. Take away all the razzle dazzle creatures and effects and the costumes and the sets and nothing is left but an empty, boring shell with nothing to say. For instance, when Obi-wan just walks into the HQ of the cloning world, the clone masters take him and show him everything. They don't ask for any kind of ID or proof that he's whom they were waiting for. They just assume that he's a Jedi and he's here for an inspection tour. The old Lucas would have shown the audience how the character would have bluffed his way through, ala Han Solo. The new Lucas blows any opportunity to create suspense at all. Even the fight with Jimbo Billy Bob Fett at the complex didn't raise any kind of alarm among the cloners. I guess they just never look out their windows, nor do they turn their communications gear on to hear Jethro Fett tell them that this Jedi was a spy. Nope, they don't do any of that, and the clone shipment goes ahead without a hitch. Stupid writing, even stupider plotting, sink this sucky excuse for a film in ten minutes. It was not compelling in any way, despite the effects. In fact, as I watched, I kept thinking that the effects were being wasted worse than putting curtains on a camel. As impressive as Star Wars and Empire were in their time, Clones is repulsive. I think the audience agrees with me, as the last time I looked, Clones was sinking fast at the box-office. I've said enough. I'll go back now and watch Spiderman, a far superior film.",0.05670995670995671,0.49937968535529514

The clone wars are a really cool and interesting topic and showing how they began would have really gripped me if this movie was just executed better. The movie is more gripping and interesting that episode 1, but not by a lot. The performances were decent, with the stand out being ewan mcgregor, who really stepped up and improved massively from episode one. The special effects are ok, but nothing amazing. The dialogue is where this film really lacks though. I feel like George Lucas has an amazing imagination and can come up with these worlds and ideas for stories but when it comes time to sit down and write the story he struggles, and this problem is only evident in the first 2 episode of Star Wars. Following the basic premise of a clone army popping up out of know where to fight for the Jedi against a droid army controlled by an intriguing evil Sith Lord is interesting.

The success of Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back is due in no small part to the input of Gary Kurtz, and other people who left the franchise before Return of the Jedi was completed.

The Special Edition changes were mostly not good ideas, and the Phantom Menace was awful. Just awful. Attack of the Clones is an improvement(less Jar Jar helps), but it still suffers from Lucas' unfettered direction and writing. Hales could not help. The dialogue is flat and unmemorable. The acting is uninspired, lifeless. MacGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi is good, but he is much too whiney. Christensen may be a good actor(havent seen him in anything else to compare), but he comes across very bad here. And Portman--she is wonderful to look at, but she has no charisma. C3PO is an asset, but his lines are basically bad puns. And Yoda? Well, his fight scene at the end was just ridiculous. The audience I saw it with was laughing--for all the wrong reasons. Lucas apparently does not care about continuity. It was bad enough to make Darth Vader the creator of C3PO, but to find him (mild spoiler) doing the precise job that he is purchased from the Jawas to do for the very same person in ANH is just insane. (end of mild spoiler) And the biggest let down may be John Williams score. Oh, how times have changed. Maybe JW just could not get inspired by what was on the screen, but whatever the case, the score is very uninvolving. It is quite sad to see George Lucas destroy his own reputation. This film lacks the spirit that made the original films so much fun. No, they were not high brow, but they were mighty entertaining. Sadly, AOTC was not.

"I didn't like Attack of the Clones at all at all. After the exciting Phantom Menace chapter I felt that this chapter wasn't as good as the first one and it was far from it. This is what I think of Attack of the Clones: some of the action is boring, dialogs are stiff and there isn't or nearly isn't a single memorable quote (how come?). Also, I hated the battle scene against the creatures in the coliseum-like place on the desert planet of Genosis because looking at it felt like watching a gladiator film rather than watching what I call a true Star Wars film. And the action that came right after this creature battle scene felt so boring. I felt that this coliseum action scene was the worst scene and action scene in the entire Star Wars saga and it also looked like hair that hasn't been combed properly and has been completely messed up. Moreover the movie doesn't have enough planet settings. Also, I think that the difficult relationship shared between Anakin Skywalker and Padme should have been explored in a bit more depth. I had a big feeling of disappointment when I watched this film and I regret that Attack of the Clones is so flawed. I wish it was much better. Oh gosh, how I hate to be disappointed with a film I expect so much from. This movie has a George Lucas being-lazy-directing-well feel to me though I know that George Lucas isn't lazy while making Star Wars films and that there must be a good explanation beneath all of these flaws but still. I'm sure that it is the most important thing to think of. My big question about this film is ""What on earth went wrong with the making of the film?"" Because of all the flaws I just described I just don't get one second why people preferred this chapter over the previous one. Few of the action sequences still dazzle however and that's a nice thing to keep in mind about this Star Wars chapter. Furthermore, the asteroid field near Genosis sequence was particularly good and had good colors even if it lacked suspense to it including the scene at the clone factory on Genosis. Also, the ocean planet of I don't know the name was a suitably memorable planet setting and the alien creatures that welcomed Obi- Wan Kenobi on this planet were great looking aliens and believable. The movie also has some good story ingredients. So the movie isn't entirely flawless after all and thank goodness for that or else...grrrrr. My rating for the Attack of the Clones is 6.1/10.

And so is the movie as a whole also, it ranks over all other Star Wars movies in my book except Star Wars: Episode 4 - ANH which is hard to beat. I like the acting including Hayden Christensen and the script is much better than when Lucas wrote it himself. Of course the movie is not without flaws, but very close to it. I don't know what's up with the negative comments here, feels like an insult. They're probably jealous or something.

"There is something about the two Star Wars prequels that I just now put my finger on after my first viewing of Episode 2: Attack of the Clones. To be blunt, these films just lack the charm of the original trilogy. The characters are all written and played very straight, almost to the point of becoming two-dimensional. There isn't any natural dynamic or tension between anybody you see on screen. Therefore, every instance of emotion, conflict and even humor come across as forced. The master/apprentice relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan seemed somewhat plastic. My ""exhibit B"" for this argument is Jar Jar from Episode 1. It was obvious he was written as comic relief. He had no other legitimate reason to be there. When you know what the punchline is ahead of time, the joke usually falls flat.",0.0825,0.39

Opening night of Attack of the Clones I was at the theatre at 10 o' clock with my dad awed by this briliant movie. THIS should have been Episode I! The plot flows much smoother and I love the battle action scenes. You can feel the dark side coming on with Anakin growing impatient too.

"First, let me say that I am a Star Wars fan. I have been since I stood in line at the theater on that fateful day in 1977, and I've loved everything since, even Phantom Menace (sure, there were bad points, but I was entertained by the film). That having been said... The only real clones are the sorry fans that will go out and see AOTC multiple times to line the pockets of Mr. Lucas. I get the distinct feeling that George resents having to make these films, after all, he's been dealing with the same basic world-scape since 1977, and more is all anyone seems to want from him-- but only more Star Wars. In response, he has delivered unto his fans a lifeless piece of digital film making. The characters are devoid of any depth, and the dialogue is some of the worst I've heard in a long time. I heard open moans of distaste in the theater at the C3-P0-turned-bad-pun-machine on the battle field. I understand the grainy aspects of the special effects are due to the movie being seen on a film projector instead of a digital one, but come on! This is no excuse for the poor overall quality of the project. It brakes the first cardinal sin of movie making: it's booooooorrrrriiing. The film started off well, and my hopes were high. But it peaked after 35 minutes, and then was flat and unimpressive until the final battle, which seemed truncated and unresolved. I know the storyline needs to be unresolved at this point, but there is no payoff within this film. You wait and wait and wait and there's nothing to justify it. Everything you want to see in this film, as far as the progression of the story-- well, it just never happens. And I can't stress enough how terrible the dialogue is. And I'm so sick of how Lucas tries to interject earthlike/human qualities and catch phrase/poses into his new aliens. If you hated the pod race announcers, and Jar Jar's ""Exsqueeze Me"" lines, you'll be sick after the diner scene in AOTC. (caution, the next sentence may be considered a spoiler) Oh, and why is it called ATTACK of the Clones? How about... Political Maneuvering of the Clones, or Creation of the Clones, or Whatta' Bunch of Clones. I say this because--- THERE IS NO ATTACK!!!!! So, this film is apparently just build up to Episode 3, and was never intended to have a life of it's own. Is that what you're doing here Mr. Lucas? Overall, a disappointing and depressing movie going experience. When Star Wars disappoints, where can you go? Oh, well......",-0.06591056670602126,0.50119277187459
"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones came out on May 16. Being the Star Wars nut I am, I went to see the movie on Friday night/ Saturday morning. Let me tell you, staying up that late is really worth it just to see this movie. Once the words `A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away' appeared on the screen and everybody started cheering, I was totally in it. Nothing else could distract me from the opening scenes and the amazing special effects. Even though, I've seen the other Star Wars, it was amazing just to see another one in a digital theater. I felt like I was really there and the world that George Lucas created came to life right before my eyes. I know that half of the scenery was a blue screen, but the added special effects that creates the creatures and the background is just so realistic and it transports you from your seat to the scene. It was a million times better than Episode I  The Phantom Menace, which was really disappointing.",0.12236842105263157,0.5107142857142858

It has all the good elements of the original trilogy, and Lucas has managed to at least downplay Jar Jar and the Trade Federation so that it doesn't interfere with the story.  Sadly, the worst oversite, the need of a new director, has not been remedied.  All the elements are there; the actors are all in top form, the special effects are quite good, and the plot, well, that is why we keep coming back.  What this film needed was someone, other than Lucas, to bring it all together. Someone has to restrain Lucas from throwing in way too much computer animation than he knows what to do with.  Sure the droid/clone battle may be the coolest thing we have ever seen, but it is the failures that really stick in your mind.  The beginning of the ""coliseum"" seen is one of them. This seemed to just scream fake to me.  Don't get me wrong; the movie holds water, and time only makes an audience more accepting of the problems.

"I grew up with Star Wars.  I loved episodes IV, V, and VI.  I can't help but feel disappointed though with the prequels.  It goes well beyond the inanity of Jar-Jar Binks.  Episodes I and II seem fundamentally flawed.  The basic story is dry.  There is action, but no excitement... no tension.  Part of this is the problem inherent in a prequel:  you already know what is going to happen.  But it goes beyond that.  The actual sequence of events has no electricity.  This is compounded by the wooden acting that is rampant in this film (and Episode I).  Since I know that McGregor, Portman, Lee, and others can act from other movies I've seen them in, I suspect the problem lies with Lucas's direction.  Lucas is a wonderful producer and good at creating a basic plot, but he should stay far away from the screenplay and direction.  What he has managed to do with Episodes I and II is create the visually stunning equivalent of a slow motion train wreck.",0.08489583333333332,0.4671875
"I was one of many who were a little underwhelmed with Episode One, and I have no complaints about Episode Two.  There is great action peppered throughout the film, and paced nicely, interspersed with moments that are slower but more plot intensive.  Hayden Christiansen is cast well as an arrogant young snot of a Jedi who still has some redeeming qualities.  The Jedi as a whole come off as all being a little bit flawed in some way, but this helps with some plot points vital to the series of films as well as this one.  Everyone seems a bit more human and vulnerable in Episode Two, and it reminds me in some ways of the Empire Strikes Back; the characters are under the gun and their weaknesses show.  Even when things look temporarily better, there are people who point out that it's far from over. The special effects are far beyond amazing, and the all-digital filming is completely unnoticeable; it all looks real, and like it was shot on film. George Lucas seems to be getting back into the swing of things as a director; there was some cool tricky ""camera"" work, and the actors seem more comfortable when talking to characters who could not possibly have been there when they were shooting it, a quality not always present in the previous film.  Coruscant is beautiful here, with a nice amalgam of visual styles in the architecture and what seemed to be one brief nod to Blade Runner.  The other worlds fare well.

Oh, most people will say it's a much better film than ""The Phantom Meance"" and in away, it is. There is no annoying Jar Jar Binks or Jake Lloyd.

What this movie needed was an edge, and only the type of edge that the monumental and legendary actor Billy Drago can deliver. At least he could have saved the film. This movie isn't dark because it is negative and warlike, it is dark because everyone falls asleep while watching it.  Episode III better well be violent as hell (because of this supposed war that is supposed to be happening) or else I will be forced to finally conclude that Lucas is catering to all the little Kiddies out there in theater land.

"This film is a disaster of cinema on a scale that could probably rank up there with 'Cleopatra' or similar botched attempts at ""epic"" cinema. George Lucas has, indeed, ""lost his touch"", as some people have said but it could be more easily explained this way: George Lucas has simply decided that the scripts of his STAR WARS prequels don't really matter that much and can be developed ""along the way"". In my opinion, and most REALLY GOOD FILMMAKERS would probably agree, this is ASS BACKWARDS. In LucasLand, apparently, you can start with an ""idea"", pay a huge staff of VERY creative graphic artists and painters to design vehicles, make models, choreograph scenes on the computer without ever having seen THE SCRIPT. Don't agree? Check out THE ART OF STAR WARS: ATTACK OF THE CLONES and you will see pages upon pages of beautiful renderings and designs that were completely wasted on a film with no script. Don't agree? Read the sorry ass excuse for a script at the back of said book. This script is so bad, it is unbelievable. It truly shows how much contempt Lucas has for the written word and this man should never be allowed near a typewriter. If I were one of the designers on this film, or The Phantom Menace for that matter, I would quit. I wouldn't want my BABIES, ships and locales that I slaved over to be used in service of some of the most haphazard and shoddy storytelling this side of Corusant. Don't agree? Watch Anatomy of a Murder. Psycho. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Kramer VS. Kramer. Star Wars. Alien. These films all had one thing in common. Before there was a CHECK cut to anyone, there was a script. Before a date was scheduled, there was a SCRIPT. It's too bad that we give Lucas so much power- somebody really needs to say no to this guy. ""Sorry George,"" I would say if I were THAT GUY, ""but you may not start this new series of films until I see AT THE VERY LEAST a script for the FIRST ONE. Oh, and most people do five or so drafts and have other people LOOK AT IT so they can tell you when you are being a dunderhead (Jar Jar, or all of the dialogue in AOTC, for example). THEN AND ONLY THEN MAY YOU COMISSION THE ARTISTS NEEDED TO PULL THIS THING TOGETHER! Not before, no, not before."" Lucas has put the cart before the horse, my friends and so that is why these films are classically bad. We are witnessing failure on a colossal scale. I'm not talking box office. If these films were good, they would be pulling down twice as much- AT LEAST- no, I'm talking about QUALITY. I'm talking about LOVE. WE LOVE STAR WARS because the first ones (or at least the first two) were made with LOVE. Like Grandma's chocolate chip cookies. The new ones?

Hell even minor characters like Salacious Crumb (the monkey-pet of Jabba the Hutt) were colorful.  The main characters also changed noticably a lot as the trilogy progressed, and that's why we loved them and wanted to know what happened to them...Han became less of a loner and realized some causes were worth fighting for; Luke became less adventurous, more introspective, and more scared of his own destiny; Leia let down her defenses towards Han and matured into one of the main leaders of the Rebellion; and Vader began showing signs of humanity towards his son.",0.16376262626262625,0.4964646464646465

The reason everything/one is so relaxed in the original 3 movies is because there in no Republic, just a band of freedom fighters called the Rebellion who are trying to overthrow the Empire.  The scenes of the Imperial army in the old trilogy were boring in the same sense the Republic political scenes are boring.

"After Episode I successfully crushed my fond childhood memories of the Star Wars franchise, I was obviously reluctant to give this one a chance, and didn't. Unfortunately, my wife is a die hard fan and I was forced to watch it. Now, Episode III was actually decent aside from the dialog (but you have to expect that from Lucas) and Christianson's wince-inducing acting, but Episode II was so jaw-droppingly bad that I was actually uncomfortable during some of the scenes. The dialog between Annikan and Obi Wan had to have been written by a child, there's no other explanation. Even Lucas can't be that bad, can he? Oh wait... Aside from that, nothing much happened for the entire movie. The one thing I ask from a Star Wars movie is that it not be dull. Is that too much to ask?

Now to Jengo Fett, who is the original clone and father to everyone's favorite Bounty Hunter, Boba Fett.  ""Little Fett"" as I call him, is there for the kids (Ok no problem)  However Jengo is there for us Big kids, who have waited over 20 years to see him kick butt.  Unfortunately you get 1 cool fight at the beginning, then he gets the AX toward the end. (When you see the arena scene...think Gladiator rip-off)  Finally for the main reason this movie is awful, is because ""who really is the bad guy?""

"I went to see this movie the first day it opened, the first showing as a matter of fact.. The theater was almost full, but not as full as it was when I saw Spider-Man on the first show of the first day.. I liked the movie quite a bit, as I am a fan of Star Wars.. I true fan must like it.. But it was missing something, mostly people.. See when they made episode one, most of the characters, and things around them were real, with CGI (computer generated images) over some of the make up and costumes, to make things look more real. But I found in this movie that even Yoda was 100% a CGI... And in most shots when you would think there should have been a stunt man or at least a human on blue screen, they just made the whole person a CGI.. And you could tell.. Some of the CGI's in this movie looked like an old 3DO game.. It was easy to tell that most of the actors had done complete scenes, (and most of the scenes this way) with a blue screen not knowing what was going to be put behind them later.. I thought the casting job was done well, I was glad to see they didn't try something stupid like casting big names for people such as Anakin Skywalker.. I did like his character, and the attitude they placed with him.. Other than the lack of non computer use, the movie was done to set up the next one in the series.. The clone wars has to be in the next movie, because it was not in this one.. Ok Here it is.. Ten years later, things have changed, so much in fact an hour of the movie sets up to explain everything.. After that, we see Anakin and Padmé, sort of fall in love.. I would say the movie starts with a beginning, beginning, beginning, middle, middle, and then we finally see some Jedi Fighting, and then the credits.. No one wins, in fact I would say the bad guys win in a way.. Nothing like the last movie, that movie started and then we saw fighting, and we were taken from there, one thing happened after another, until in the end we are at piece, everything worked out, there was a plot, beginning, middle and end.. Episode 2 doesn't have any of that.. Though we get to see Yoda in action for the first time!! This movie will be a great movie when the next one comes out, until than, it will just p**s you off to see it, because you will want to know what will be next!!!! I almost want to go see it again, just to see if more happens the next time around.. I give it 5 out of 10 stars.. Hit, or Miss..",0.15543560606060605,0.3537878787878787

"Ah, the simplicity of the original STAR WARS: A standard McGuffin (the Death Star plans) to set the action in motion, a few heroes trying to rescue a princess, a bad guy in black.  It's hard to believe that the writer-director who so masterfully conceived this space western could muck things up so much, both with complicated politics (who are we really supposed to be rooting for?) and inane dialogue.  The film nearly comes to a standstill whenever Hayden Christensen, as Annakin-cum-Darth Vader, spills his heart to dear Padme' (Natalie Portman).  As I suspected after LIFE AS A HOUSE, Christensen is a sincere and intense actor, but not a very good one.  His face is boyish and flat, without any character, definition, or shadow: he's like a breathing Ken doll.  But despite being a magnet for complaining fans, I won't trash the film.  I went to see it eyes-wide-open, knowing what Lucas's obsessions have become: It is not even a ""film"" in the technical sense -- the whole thing was shot digitally -- because Lucas has turned into a techno-geek.  His way may be the future of how movies WILL be MADE, but it is not how they SHOULD be FELT.  Just as FINAL FANTASY reminded us why actors usually are needed to make audiences care, CLONES stands as an important and fairly entertaining example of the potential of technology, without doing much damage to the promise that good screenwriting and actor trump all kinds of glitz.

The Phantom Menace was something new ,a really deep dramatic toned addition to the saga and I didn't liked it so much because of the boring political drama.

The plot is still too reliant on the episodic sequence, it doesn't stand alone. The romance is cringingly awful, Amidala/Padme refuses Anakin's advances then all of a sudden says she loves him. There is no consequence for Anakin's evil deeds. There are plot holes (landing in a vent of steam and walking through it would be deadly). The end battle is spectacular, but you don't really care about any of the characters. The film's over long and some of the set pieces drag.

I found myself yawning a few times there, and it seemed telling that though the theater was packed with kids, there was no fanfare among them.

But when it comes to story and what Star Wars are really about, then it´s no better than chapter I, maybe in some ways even worse. But still, there are a few points that I liked. Since the new trilogy is more about silly politics than anything else, I really liked how he treats Palpatine. I could see his rise from the strange character in shadows to the Great Emperor in the old trilogy. We all knew that in Attack of the Clones we are going to witness the start of an Anakin-Amidala romance, but what we got here is dreadful. Dialogues and the whole love story can only be compared to the lines of Dawson´s Creek or some soapish nonsense like that. And the philosophical lines are now laughibly pretentious and meaningless. Again, very similar to chapter one, this is a very enjoyable movie to watch and it has some of the most spectacular scenes ever to be seen in science-fiction cinema.

"When Episode 1 came out I thought it was going to be one of the best films I have ever seen.I was wrong.Now that Episode 2 is out,I must say that it is the worst of all of them!!!It was horrible!!!!After disliking Episode 1,while most people liked it,I was hoping 2 would make up for it.It did not.In the fifth to the Star Wars trilogy,Anakin has grown up,a jedi knight,and is madly in love with Padme,who does not share the same feelings for him.Most of the film takes place in space and has a great deal of jedi battles,which I expect to see.There was one thing,and I do mean only one,where Yoda has a jedi fight with an evil Jedi.That was really cool but it was'nt enough to save the movie.Thousands of fans camped out weeks before it came out,they were not missing out on anything.I was very disappointed with Episode 2 and when 3 comes out I doubt it will be any different.I liked the first three Star Wars movies,Return Of The Jedi being my favorate.I did NOT like Episode 1 or 2.Most fans loved 1,I don't know why.It is supposed to tell the story behind Luke Skywalker's father Anakin and how he becomes Darth Vader.It does,but in a very disappointing way.Natalie Portman acts out her part well,but the acting is not what's wrong with this movie.What's wrong is how boring it and unentertaining it is.If anyone has not yet seen Episode 2,take my advice,don't.Hopefully 3 will be at least okay,but somehow I seriously doubt it.",-0.0680333333333333,0.6539000000000001
Its a bit better at pacing the Phantom MENACE but its still a bore to sit through specially the first hour that depends on the romance between Anakin and Padme but the problem is these 2 characters or actors has absolutely zero chemistry with each other.There also seems to be a problem with the plot and the problem is there is no engaging plot just action scenes stitched together to make a money making sequel.The cgi and green screens are very poorly done and some things don't make sense like Jar Jar being a politician now LOL WTF or R2D2 flying around like superman.Theres also alot of forced comedy that just dont fight.The final action scene really saves this movie but as a film its not good just a very meh SW movie,0.03982142857142859,0.5177976190476191

"When I made my original review for this film, I must have been in a bad mood. While I can say that this is one of the lesser Star Wars films, it is in no way as bad as Episodes 8 or 9. I would place this just above 9 and way above 8 (8 is lying at the depths compared to the rest). The Film has stilted dialogue, effects that have begun to age, and a romance plot that feels awkward most of the time. However, there are some creative set pieces on display and the character of Count Dooku is a welcome addition the Star Wars universe. In addition to this, it serves a greater purpose within the Star Wars universe in setting up The Clone Wars and providing details that are necessary to understanding Anakin's change in character, thus providing more of a reason to exist in the canon than any of the sequel films do. Overall, not great but not as bad as I originally thought.",0.026470588235294155,0.6088235294117647

"Saw ep. 2 last night and whilst I wasn't going in with the highest expectations (remembering the dissapointment of ep.1), I couldn't believe what I saw. Is this the same universe as the original trilogy? This is moviemaking by the numbers, and done in a very, very bad way. Lucas has forgotten how to direct, write and worse: to make an even slightly entertaining movie. The effects are in some cases awesome, but we're used to that now, so you have to bring a story, likable characters and a sense of joy. It is all missing. Lucas doesn't know what he's doing. That is for certain now. It's action for the sake of action, it serves almost no purpose. The characters are so dull that I personally couldn't care less what's happening to them. Ewan looks out of place and ashamed at sometimes as does Sam Jackson. But the worst mistake Lucas made was bringing Christensen in. Man, what a stiff! OK he was given the most terrible lines, but his acting does make your toes curl...No chemistry with Portman (who's rather flat too). No, I lost my faith in the force. Highlights: Christopher Lee and Yoda's lightsaberaction.",0.017837301587301582,0.4383928571428571
"Having spent the last hour wading through dozens of reviews here, I'm frankly shocked at the poor quality of the reviews.  What matters is the RESULT and not the method.  Consider Shakespearean Acting:  it's wooden and contrived, but the sum of the dialogue and the acting just happen to work.",-0.2125,0.28958333333333336
"First of all, it's not entirely because of the lovey-dovey stuff that I do not like this movie.  Nevermind the fact that Portman and Christensen have as much chemistry as Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaghey in ""Contact"": pretty much non-existent.  The literally laughable scenes of ""romance,"" which is defined as ""cheesy sappy one-liners exchanged at an utterly inopportunate timing"" in ""George Lucas' Dictionary of Directing,"" is not the main reason for this movie being particularly bad, but it did make it particularly awful.  Think of it as the proverbial ""cherry on top"" -- not on top of a metaphorical heap of ice cream in this case, but more like a metaphorical heap of cinematic manure. I just thought it was boring.  BOOOOORING....  Not exciting, unless you measure how exciting a film is according to how much visual effects your eyes are assaulted with.  At some point in time, George Lucas that was directing films died and was replaced by one who directs special effects. The rest of the movie feels like it was totally abandoned by the director (and the actors as well at times).  A ten year old can write a script with more clever and exciting lines.  Sam Jackson jumps into battle and utters: ""This party's over!""  Riiiiight....  Christensen mumbles through his confession of love, crying and bitching about ""the kiss you should never have given"" and exclamating, ""I'm in agony!""  Well, SO ARE WE!  Portman confesses her love later on with her ""truly, madly, deeply"" crud.  Haven't seen a more awkward couple since Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles in ""Down To You."" So in neglecting everything that is not related to CG action scenes (and I hope it was neglect, because if that was truly the product of Lucas direction, then he has officially lost his cinematic mojo), Lucas has sacrificed the entire movie.  Since the rest of the movie was incredibly insipid, that meant that the battles had to save the film.  Sad to report, that did not happen.  What a boring movie.  Even the usually decent storytelling wasn't there.  Lucas seems to have lost it.  I think it's a combination of not having directed anything for nearly two decades before Episode I and the utter arrogance that he has come to possess over the years while he was making gazillion dollars off of the first trilogy.  I was actually glad to be assured that Episode II will not be the highest grossing movie this year.  Lucas needs some spanking from some movie-goers with decent taste.  This is worse that Episode I -- there, I said it! And I've said this after I saw Episode I and I'll say it again: I wish this movie was never made.  If I ever run into Mr Lucas, I know what to say: ""Those movies that you should never have made...they haunt me in my dreams. I'm in agony!""",0.020115079365079374,0.5718730158730159
"The shear amount of special effects detracts from the actual subject being filmed.  After a certain point, I stopped saying ""Oh that's cool"" and began thinking, ""OK, get on with the picture.""  The attire that Natalie Portman wears is also a bit too revealing.  It made me think of a Sci-Fi version of Brittany Spears, enough with the abs!!!!  Natalie is gorgeous from head to toe, but I think she'd be better off showing it in a another film.  This film is not as good as the any of the others.  I hope Episode III will raise the bar, this one did not meet my expectations.",0.3154761904761905,0.5226190476190476
"Who would have thought that Star Wars, one of the most thrilling, dynamic series ever created, would become formulaic; well, it's happened. Around twenty years ago, Star Wars was a series with something for everyone: drama, action, romance; with themes encompassing love, friendship, and family. Now George Lucas is milking that reputation by revamping the original scripts. Not to spoil anything, but the film moves at the same pace as ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and has a disgustingly similar conclusion. This occurred with Episode I as well, but in addition the rewritten plot, Episode II features a weak script and poor acting. The obvious hole is generated by the absence of Liam Neeson, whose performance was exemplary in Episode I and whose acting skill seemed to inspire good performances from young stars Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman. Now Neeson-less, McGregor and Portman seem rather dry. Portman, whose career has interested me since ""Heat"", turns in her first big lemon. With respect to Portman, I blame this partially on her co-star Hayden Christensen, whose pseudo-sensitive/romantic approach to the role of Anakin Skywalker, comes off as a non-descript monotone with a complete lack of emotion and he seems to drain feeling from every scene. Luckily, the floundering leads have help. Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) steal every scene they're in, while the rest of the characters stagger around with poor lines and bad acting until the climactic battle. Whereas `The Empire Strikes Back' was thematically (though not ultimately) the best of the original trilogy, `Attack of the Clones' can hope nothing more than to span the gap between Episode I and III, and let us hope that this will be the low point of the series. 3 out of 10 stars.",0.09644607843137257,0.3985294117647059
"This movie was quite impressive. The awesome special effects (included in nearly every scene) were a major highlight of this film. The plot was very long-winded and drawn out, but necessary for the beginning of the explanation of Episodes IV, V, and VI. Also, what i consider the main thing that you will remember from this film, is the scene where Yoda battles with Dooku in a light saber duel. Yoda, who is usually slow-moving with the aid of a cane, brings the ultimate example of Jedi skill and style ever seen in a Star Wars movie.

The writing is still bad, the acting is still not that great, the special effects are still way over used( the aliens in costumes look much better than the ones that are all computer), and the love story is just plain bad. Im not sure what lucas was thinking when writing out the dialog but its like he cant figure out how to have interesting conversations. Lucas never uses more words than he has to move the plot along(unless its to make a sassy remark at the worst times)Maybe its just me but i like to see normal conversations sometimes so that we can really learn about the characters.Action wise the movie is pretty good. The fight between Obi wan and jongo fett is great and anakin going on a killing spree was suprising and just plain awesome. But other moments when the movie could be great its killed by stupid jokes. The end was getting really good until c3po has to screw it up with bad jokes that dont fit.If Lucas has done anything right its that ill see episode 3 cause there is still a chance to end star wars with a bang. FOr me thats having a plot twist no one see's coming.WHy does anakin have to be Vader? WHy does he have to be the father of luke?

"I just went to see Attack of the Clones for the second time. It was terrific. It wiped out The Phantom Menace, which desecrated the Star Wars Saga. Hayden Christensen was out of this world. He carries this movie. His portrayal of Anakin is exceptional. The climax of the movie is when his anger consumes him to the point, he looses control. A sign of things to come. This one scene has more raw emotion then any other scene in the Star Wars trilogy. This makes Vader's fate more believable. Granted that ATOC is a little of beat in some instances, it accomplishes something that the previous three couldn't. It immerses the audience in the true world of Star Wars to a point that has not been reached before. Gamers have had a glimmer of George Lucas' imagination, but ATOC fully expanded this in the movie. Finally, ATOC set the tone for the movie that I believe will be the most shocking of the 6, and will explain how Anakin becomes Darth Vadar.",0.040448717948717954,0.556880341880342

"Brilliant Images and terrific sound, even more so if you see it in a digital theater, help bring this film to life. Therein lies the fault. this film, despite all its wonderful technological Prowess, ultimately yields a HIGHLY unsatisfying experience for the viewer.The film's attempts at humor go overboard, and the style grows quickly stale. The History, such as it is, is presented as well as can be expected, but, there are times when I, at least, couldn't help but think that it seems as if LUCAS has tinkered with what has already been established.Looking at the story, what little there is, one YEARNS for the middle chapter of the first trilogy, one wants the WONDER of A NEW HOPE, the CAREFREE attitude of RETURN OF THE JEDI. You will not find that here. Instead, you get Anakin Skywalker, whom from the older films, we know will one day become known as DARTH Vader, reduced to a typical teen suffering the WHINIEST form of angst. Even the Defining moment in the Film, Which serves to let the Viewer see the EXACT turning point in his life, is a bit of a letdown, due mainly to the fact that HAYDEN Christensen, who portrays him, has next to no acting ability. He is in fact, as banal as Jake Lloyd, who performed the role in PHANTOM MENACE, and once more, Natalie Portman shows that, while a Beauty, she cannot overcome her surroundings, and NEVER once rises above the material or her on-screen partners. Even R2-D2 and C3po are given short shrift. Yes, they play a somewhat larger part in this, but, what screen-time they get is wasted. Christopher Lee, always a marvelously Unique actor, seems uncomfortable in his role. EVEN YODA seems to have problems....Quite a feat, considering it is an entirely DIGITAL creation. The annoying JAR JAR BINKS....and this may be considered a spoiler, it may not, plays a VASTLY reduced role....yet one cannot help but get the impression that, perhaps LUCAS, if not winking at himself, which HE COULD be, I suppose, is rather, stuffing the atrocity down our collective throats once more? but, I digress. The point is, If you love Star wars, see it. If you love Star Wars, know it is not what it used to be.

Cast was great and there were enough subplots to keep an active mind busy.  I want to watch this several more times today, but first.....MUST SLEEP.  I stood in line for 6 hours for the best seat in the house (which I got) and it was worth every second.  Can no one understand the passion behind waiting for something really great?  I was so amazed at this movie.  I came in with high expectations, very excited, and even so, my ever wish was fulfilled, I couldn't have asked for more.  George Lucas has outdone himself again.

Great story, the action, great effects, great acting, except for Hayden Christensen. He's ok but not great.",0.40833333333333327,0.5694444444444444
"There are some films that go beyond their genre, becoming something greater, something that nearly anyone can enjoy, with powerful performances and excellent writing and directing.  The Sixth Sense.  Gone With the Wind.  As Good as it Gets.  The original Star Wars Trilogy.  The Matrix.  Films that may not be without flaws, but nevertheless are an inspiration to watch. Star Wars Episode II is not one of those films.  It is a sci-fi film...that's all.  As those things go, it's certainly decent enough, and definitely worth watching, but it isn't anything particularly special. Anyway, here ends the comparison to other films, and begins my commentary on this one alone. ""Attack of the Clones"" is, largely, the story of Anakin Skywalker's coming of age, and his difficulties in dealing with his love for Amidala and the subtle manipulations of Palpatine as he learns the ways of the Jedi from his teacher, Obi-Wan Kenobi--who he believes is holding him back.  This is set against the larger story of the political troubles of the Republic, which is faced with a terrible choice between watching planets split off and destroy the unity that once was or fighting those that rebel and watching the destruction arise even quicker as they destroy the very principles upon which it is based.  And at the head of it all is Palpatine, a scheming mastermind who uses all the others, from senator to Jedi, like pieces in a chess game.  It's a great setup, and could lead to an excellent plot. Unfortunately, it's derailed early on in the film...in part, due to the performances given by some of the actors.  Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are the focus of a great part of the film as Anakin and Amidala...and come off as very flat.  The emotions they portray seem false...as though, really, they were just trying too hard.  It doesn't help that the writing for their many scenes is generally overdone, with the lines written in such a way that they simply can't be said in a natural manner. There are a great many scenes between the two in the film, and each has very little true point being there...it would've been far better to have fewer scenes, with more meaning in each. What is so unusual about this film is that it really seems to have been written and directed by two different people.  By contrast to the Anakin/Amidala parts, the Obi-Wan parts of the film are quite excellent, extremely entertaining and filled with neat plot points and stellar performances by just about everyone involved.  Ewan McGregor, in particular, does an amazing job of portraying Obi-Wan, exactly as he should be portrayed, and brings the character to life in a way few actors can.  His parts of the film save it, easily...though they perhaps also make the Anakin/Amidala parts more depressing to sit through, because of the stark contrast.  It's really very odd. I have several problems with various parts of the movie's plot.  Most, probably unsurprisingly, fall within the Anakin/Amidala parts of the film. I won't comment on most of them, because often it'd spoil parts of the movie for those who haven't seen it...but I will comment on one thing.  *SPOILER WARNING* Anakin's attack on the Tusken Raiders was horribly handled--in my opinion, the attack should not have happened in this film, especially not if it is going to be ignored for most of the rest of the movie, outside of one single scene.  I'm not saying that it should've been the focus of the rest of the film, but the writing seemed to suggest that watchers are expected to look at Anakin in the same way they always have...when he's just slaughtered an entire camp, men, women, AND children.  *END SPOILER* In any case, ""Attack of the Clones"" is worth watching, if only to form your own opinion on the film.  It was certainly entertaining, which is all I really ask for when I go to a movie...but in the end, it is only a decent sci-fi action film, that had so much potential to be better--not because of the Star Wars name, but because of the honestly great idea for the general plot.

As for ""Anakin's"" acting....go back and view the first Star Wars movie Mark Hammil stared in,he isn't exactly Oscar material, Sorry Mark.

He can't use the force to track a bounty hunter in the 2Fast2Stupid race sequence, he can't use the force to outrun her, and he can't use the force to find her in a crowded pub.

For Star Wars fans, the thrill of seeing the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin, the creation of the Clone-troopers,  and the breathtaking action is enough to make everyone forget the dissapointing Episode 1.  And there is one scene that everyone should go in knowing absolutely nothing about, but alas, most reviewers seem compelled to spill the beans on what is one of the most thrilling sequences in Star Wars history.

Natalie Portman's performance wasn't really any better than that of her co-star. At the time they were filming, Portman was a college student who was not certain that she wanted to make acting her life's work, so she didn't put her all into her performance.

"I used to believe that you couldn't have too much of a good thing. Now I'm not so sure. In the latest installment of the STAR WARS saga, creator George Lucas does his best to raise the bar yet again in the area of special effects. While his technical accomplishments here are undeniably impressive, the film falls short of being perfect. I've seen this film twice now, and given a considerable amount of thought to what sort of opinions I'd express about it. I'm not looking to upset anyone with my statements, so please consider this as nothing more than one person's perspective. That said, our story opens with Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), formerly Queen Amidala, arriving on the giant city-planet of Coruscant. After an attempt is made on her life, it is deemed necessary by the powers that be to have Jedi protection assigned to her. The Senator's old friend Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is called upon, escorted by his student Anakin (Hayden Christensen), who is all grown up and eager to see Padme after so many years apart. Their arrival to assist the Senator is met with pleasure, but Anakin quickly realizes his feelings for Padme are stronger than expected. After a second attempt on her life, members of the Jedi council decide to begin an investigation to find those responsible. Anakin is told to protect Padme, while Obi-Wan searches for some answers elsewhere. Thus begins two journeys, and two continuing storylines that will carry us through the rest of the film. Anakin must deal with his love for Padme, which is forbidden by his beliefs, and unacceptable for a woman in her position. During his quest for the Senator's assassin, Obi-Wan discovers a plot much more complicated than anyone imagined. A clone army is being created under the supposed authorization of the Jedi council.

"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is, contrary to popular belief, is a great film. Unlike many, I do not compare it to other Star Wars movies to judge the movie as a whole. Obviously nothing can top the original Star Wars, whether how good the movie is or not. Episode II is wonderfully directed, written well for Star Wars (reality writing isn't what Star Wars wants), okay acting (Portman was a disappointment), awesome special effects, and much more. It lived up to the Star Wars name just like Phantom Menace did three years before. This time, it had more violence and more lightsaber action, and less Jar Jar Binks... Thank god. This movie had a lot of good and bad points that showed throughou the film. The good, was the world that Lucas formed- it felt as if the viewer was inside that life, Ahhhh the beauty of Science Fiction! The action scenes were quite intense and groundbreaking, most of which were high scale war scenes that never had been used before. Yeah, so what if they were fighting in blue screens? Do you really think Lucas would show a war with people dressed up as droids? Yeah he'd have to find thousands of people for that. Hayden Christensen did a wonderful job as Anakin Skywalker and so did Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi- who really showed off his jedi knowledge and power in this movie, as well as his acting. Christopher Lee (The Man with the Golden Gun) also did a good job as the villian; rarely do you see a grounded villian who is not savage and at peace with himself. That is the best villian you can have in a movie and that's why Lee as Count Dooku survived.  Unlike the Phantom Menace, Episode II failed not to make you fall asleep, but to take nothing away from Phantom Menace, the 1st Star Wars (Episode Four) does make you fall asleep at times. Lastly, when Yoda came in, it was not only funny but very entertaining. I won't give away much more, but Yoda definitely is my sunshine. Now to the bad points. The Romance between Anakin and Senator Amidala was way too childish. Childish is alright, but this love was like 1st grade love. One scene Anakin acts jealous because of a boy Amidala was with and another scene Anakin acted like he was hurt and rolled and played with Amidala in the grass. O how sweet. It would of been nice if the love story was built up a little bit more- that was like the second scene with the two together in there newly found attraction. Plus, every time it cut back to the soon to be couple, they were at a different romantic location. Is this the Travel Channel or something? Also, one actress who failed to make a good stand was Natalie Portman who did a bad job, I think, as Senator Amidala. Hayden had all the chemistry to fuel his relationship with Amidala, and even together, it looked like Hayden was the only one driven on pure energy on love. Amidala looked like she was loving him as a friend, more than anything else. But the romance wasn't the only problem, as Portman just didn't ""feel"" her role so to speak. Overall, great movie. Relax and enjoy your time at the theater. This is not a kids movie like many people believe; this is a teenage flick and should be watched anyways regardless of your age.

"I was disappointed with Lucas's previous movie Phantom of the Menace as I found it to be flat with a slow development of the storyline. Lucas used a new approach to this movie and wastes no time in getting the audience straight into the action. You can almost compare this movie with those of James Bond where a simple storyline is woven with lavish settings, visuals and actions. There are some spectacular scenes of cities and locations shot on the various planets but the overall feel appears slightly artificial. The alien characters  also appear animated and not as lifelike as one would have expected. Acting is also somewhat sub standard and was particularly disappointed with Samuel Jackson's somewhat muted performance. However, performances by the old veteran Christopher Lee and the voice of Yoda (Frank Oz) lifted this movie. There seemed to be an urgency in the film as the scenes were shot in quick succession in various locations and so tended to depart away from the central theme of the story. Normally the musical score gets unnoticed in most epics but in this case it appeared more pronounced which could be argued as good or bad. The intimate relationship between Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padme Amidala was tackled early in the movie with the premise that that the Star Wars saga will continue.   The final battle scenes was by far the best part of the movie. The complex mechanics of machinery, robots, humans and aliens battling on the desert was very well captured on screen. Like all good spirited action movies we see the supreme republican members of the council also engaged in hand to hand combat. Stunning visuals with good actions are let down by a weak cast but entertaining to watch nevertheless.",0.07277119016249452,0.46595457682414215

"I saw this twice in theaters, three times on DVD with little desire to see it again.

There is little of anything of real significance going on here... nothing meaningful, just mostly filler to tie the audience over until Episode III was released. The last time I saw this film I became so bored I really was tempted to just press the stop button.
From a film making point of view it is okay. It lacks that Star Wars sense of realism - which is due to heavy use of CGI. I don't consider this movie as having good special effects (strange to say for a Star Wars movie), the Phantom Menace was better in that regard. The acting is certainly not great. The whole movie feels like ""let's just try and get this one out of the way."" you know, a lack of real passion for what they were making.
I think non Stars Wars fans may enjoy this film more than the fans. It's really hard for me to try and say anything that positive about this film, after watching interviews I think George Lucas knew this wasn't a good film and why it wasn't really given any real huge media blitz upon release. He tried to say the movie failed because people don't like romance... which I think is merely an excuse for making a terrible movie.
Okay, spoiler, the number one thing that gripes me about this movie is the ending. Why would 10,000 Jedi, with the Force as their ally, need clone troopers?

Sure, the visual effects were stunning (with almost too much going on in the backgrounds), but this was the most poorly acted of the 5 films.  Hayden Christensen (""Anakin Skywalker""), Sam Jackson (""Mace Windu""), and Christopher Lee (""Darth Tyranus"") sound like they are reading lines right off of cue cards.  And there are WAY too many love (or, 'pre-love') scenes between Anakin and Amidala.  I know that's a huge part of the entire story, but I found them sooo boring.  Some of the light-saber fights are good, but many other scenes were unintendedly funny (like Yoda fighting Darth Tyranus).  C-3PO is hilarious - probably the most redeemable character in the film, though Ewan McGregor does a good job as ""Obi-Wan""...   After the film we all discussed how this was too similar to ""Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Gladiator"" (I kept waiting for Russell Crowe to pop up in that scene).  I will say that Lucas does plant the seeds for Episode III very well, as everything will be connected between the trilogies in 3 years. At least Jar Jar's role was limited in this one...   Overall I'd rank this one 3rd (behind 'Empire' and the original) and give it a 6 or 7/10.  Maybe if I see it a few more times (I'm sure I will), it will improve in my eyes.

"When i think about Star Wars i don't think about a stupid romantic movie. And this is that, a stupid romantic movie. Attack of the clones has the same errors than the phantom menace, it has an horrible CG, some boring unidimensional characters and some ridiculous action scenes just as the spaceship scene at the start of the film. All of these plus the annoying and pointless romantic plot line makes this a piece of garbage.

"One of the problems of Episode II (and Episode I) is George Lucas struggle to support the simple story of the original trilogy with a history. The weak plot  did not bother twenty years ago (the attention was on the effects), since the original Star Wars trilogy was only one step up from other trivial SF movies like Battle Star Galactica. But if you try to give a trivial story a convoluted background, the outcome is trivial convolution.

"I'll start by saying that I am not one of those that was disappointed with Episode One.  I didn't expect it to be as good as the classic trilogy, and was satisfied with what Lucas delivered back in '99.  Yes, Jar Jar Binks was annoying, but he certainly didn't come close to ruining the film for me. That said, I expected more from Episode 2.  I think many of us were expecting Episode 2 to be a big step up from one, as Lucas didn't have to introduce every character this time around.  I expected more action, a more substantive story, and less sentimentality/""feel good"" scenes.  Lucas did deliver on the latter; this movie is certainly the ""darkest"" Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back.  Not only is Binks' role much reduced, but equally annoying (to me) C3PO doesn't get much screen time either.  The problem with Episode 2 is that the plot isn't much to right home about.  In my opinion, the foundation for the establishment of the galactic empire could (and should) have been presented in a much better way than what Clones delivers. The acting simply isn't very good.  Ewan McGregor has the distinct look of a #2 guy to me.  He was fine as Liam Neeson's sidekick in Episode 1, but in my opinion isn't leading man material.  Hayden Christenson's Anakin Skywalker is far more interesting and compelling than the child actor from Episode 1, but isn't likely to garner many acting awards for his work here either.  I must admit that I was much happier with Natalie Portman this time around. Relieved of her ridiculous costumes from Episode 1, she was much improved this time.  What this movie really lacked was a strong villain.  There is no dashing Darth Maul around this time.  The lightsaber battle between Maul and Qui-Gon/Obi Wan from episode one is easily the best combat sequence I've ever seen in a movie.  It is not repeated here.  The fight scenes between Jengo Fett and the jedi are good, but not nearly as memorable.  Overall, I think Episode 2 will be the least successful of the Star Wars movies.  It is taking harsh criticism.  While this will not deter anyone that is a legitimate Star Wars fan from seeing it, I do believe that this film will suffer (when compared to the previous films) at the box office, because many fans will be unsatisfied to the point of seeing it only once, rather than returning several times.  It is a good movie, but ""good"" just doesn't cut it when Star Wars is concerned.  I believe we have a right to expect more than Episode 2 delivered.",0.19903954802259885,0.48154156577885393

However let us break it down. The Primary reason behind EP.II. Was to show the growing Love between Anakin and Padme. Yes I admit George is a great Sci-Fi Writer/Director. His ability to write and Direct love scenes is not the greatest. But who really sees a SW Movie for the Love Story. Did the Clumsy Dialoge and Predictable Romance Ruin the Movie. NO! The story progressed as promised. Let's look at the fun behind this Movie. First the speeder chase through the skies of Couroscant. That was adventure at it's finest. The battle between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett. Awesome and even better than that. OF course, when Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Padme face the Beasts. That was a little to reminiscent of the '50's TV Serials. However it was something new for the SW saga. Then when the Jedi arena battle begins. Welcome to Star Wars!!!! Jedi fighting in battle, I have waited My whole life for this scene and they got it just right. Then the Clone Wars Officially Begin, the Clones attack and the battle is on. These two scenes are two of the best visuals I have ever seen. It made me want to go home, Take out my vintage Star Wars figures and play with them all over again. Now to the detractors. Really is the movie as bad as you say, or are you really a Brokeback Mountain fan. Come clean now. This movie is Star Wars. Yes there is too much forced Dialoge, Yes there is too much, that could have been changed.

Now we can't be surprised the same way but unconsciously we want to have that same feel of excitement we once had. So, some of you get disappointed because you expect too much from just a movie (and from a director that is not specially brilliant). But think with me for a minute. This movies can't be written only for Star Wars fans. They are expensive and they must get to the masses. They must be worth seeing for us, original Star Wars fans, and for the new adolescents, kids and grown ups that didn't specially liked the first trilogy.

That bothered me about Episode I.  Negatives: I still think George Lucas relies too much on computer- generated special effects and doesn't concentrate enough on developing his characters.

"I can safely say after watching this, this is the worst Star Wars film ever. The main problem in my eyes is Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). The future dark lord of the Sith is reduced to a whiny hormonal teenager in this film. In fairness Christensen doesn't have much to work with here as this script is infamous for having cringey 'Romantic' dialogue. This is most present after Padme (Natalie Portman) seemingly falls in love with Anakin after he describes his hatred of sand to her. On top of this the plot feels disjointed to say the least, as we hop back and forth from Anakin and Padme's misadventures to Obi-Wan's (Ewan McGregor) time on Kamino. As Obi-Wan is an infinitely more interesting character this goes some way to diverting our attention from the intended leads in Anakin and Padme. This all leads us to the third act on the planet of Geonosis as the film reaches it's climax as the Rebublic's army of super soldiers knows as 'the clones' arrives and saves countless Jedi from being executed in an arena. From there we witness a lightsaber duel between Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda and Count Dooku. This is Arguably the only good part of the film. Eventually the droids are defeated and forced to retreat and the Jedi prevail. Overall not a bad film with definite entertainment value but a cringe romantic subplot and a uneven sequence makes for potentially a tough film to watch.",0.06825396825396823,0.4544642857142857

Now that installment is here, and it is everything I was waiting for.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.  The acting was a wonderful improvement over its predecessor, and Hayden Christensen stole the show.  I was captivated by his portrayal of a man teetering on the edge.  But all the characters, not just Anakin, seemed more real this time around.  The story is much more emotionally charged in Attack of the Clones, and the film itself is an action movie, love story, whodunnit mystery and a story of deep personal conflict all rolled into one.  The special effects are fantastic, it being a Lucas joint and all, but what makes this film such a marked improvement over The Phantom Menace is that the storyline, not the CGI, really drives the film.  This movie offers something for everyone of all ages and is well worth the price admission (several times, at that).

And that movie will finally answer the fateful question:  Why does Vader wear a helmet?  In fact, it has nothing to do with keeping him alive or helping him breath.

The acting is good, even with the one-liners and whininess of Anakin Skywalker.  You know, overall, I think Hayden Christensen did a good job.  I mean come on, admit it.  He was fine. It was the whining of his character that bothered me.  Whining about Amidala, whining about how jealous Obi-Wan was of him.  I mean there is only so much I can take.  I'm very thankful that the film is 142 minutes so all that was spaced out. Natalie Portman as Senator Amidala also gave a good acting performance. She wasn't to bit*** and you saw enough of her to be satisfied.  What I didn't like about her character was that she was so reluctant to give in to Anakin. Even though it was obvious that she wanted him.  I mean come on! Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan was good as usual...I wasn't expecting anything less of him and I wasn't left disappointed.  Same with Samuel L. Jackson, whom I like, but whose character and battle scenes are short-lived. I kind of wanted to see more of him. You saw him enough I will admit, and he interacted well with the other characters, but I wanted more of him as well as Yoda. Despite all that, which seems more than enough to hate the film, the action and the quasi-romance scenes make up all together. I've seen it twice and I plan on seeing it again.

"Like many fans, I was sorely disappointed with Episode one.  So much so, that I wasn't too interested in seeing this one.  A friend talked me into it, and it was worth it!  This movie is as far above Episode I as Episode I was below the originals!  Epic battle scenes, that unfortunately will be criticized by the same people who criticized the CG battle in Fellowship of the Ring.  My only complaint, and it isn't really fair, is that all of the vehicles (although they do begin to resemble the vehicles used in Episode IV, as logic should expect)look more advanced than the vehicles that replace them (ie., in Episode IV and beyond).  I know, I know, no one wants to see a movie made in 2002 that uses technology from the 1970's.  But if I'm designing vehicles for a movie supposedly set BEFORE the original, I'd see it as a challenge to make them look interesting, but becoming obsolete, to be replaced by the next generation (which happens to be 25 years older). Fans who felt they wasted their money on Episode I will not feel that way with this one.  The Yoda fight scene alone was worth the money!  Yoda kicks BUTT!

"Well I was one of the first to see this movie (At 12:01) , and I thought that it was truly breathtaking. The visual effects were beautiful. The music score was wonderful. You could easily portray in your mind what was happening without the picture, the music was that good. The acting was great too. I see why Robin Gurland and George Lucas chose Christensen for the role. The Chemistry between Portman and Christensen was there, you could easily sense it. Though it does not rival the chemistry between Ford and Fischer in Episode V and Episode VI. The movie kept you attentive the whole time, except for when back on Naboo. Fortunately that was made up for with Obi Wan's troubles. As if  the whole movie wasn't good enough, the last 30 minutes completely astonished me. Everywhere something was happening, lightsabers were swishing all about, millions of weaponfire, and explosions that left you speechless. Ending the movie, I thought that the confrontation with Dooku was wonderful. The agility shown between the fights was amazing. Then with the Yoda fight, that was truly amazing. He moved so quickly and proved his character to be truly powerful, instead of the normal walking around on a  cane. The end is very chilling, having the imperial music as Darth Tyrannus and Sidious meet. Especially with the views of the millions of Clone troopers. Then finally the most chilling is seeing the wedding, and seeing Anakin's new arm. (I thought that it would have been more like Luke's hand.)

"Many fans may have been disappointed with The Phantom Menace (not me though) and hated the character Jar Jar Binks (again, not me) or Jake Lloyd's portrayal of Anakin Skywalker (yup, you guessed my opinion). The film was also too dry and impersonal (okay, you got me there). Let me just say that I feared the worst for Attack of the Clones. I was disappointed when the title was announced. I was disappointed when I saw the first teaser. I was disappointed when I saw the ""Forbidden Love""-trailer. I started to show slight interest again when I saw the ""Clone Wars""-trailer. So I went to see this with a minimum of expectations - some sort of ""Pearl Harbor"" in space, let's say. Boy, was I WRONG! The love story didn't annoy me one bit, as I thought it would. At the beginning, when Ani's love remains unanswered, I felt sorry for him. When Ani and Padmé are driven into the arena near the end, I felt tearing up inside at the (hokey, but so heart-warmingly delivered) line: ""Every day since I saw you again, a part of me has died. I truly, deeply love you."" Poor Padmé. I felt so bad for her, especially knowing what'll happen to her love in EpIII. Obi-Wan was, as we say in Ebonics, the illest (great, entertaining and loveable performance, as usual, by our man Ewan). Temuera Morrison was a likeable villain in the role of Jango Fett and Christopher Lee felt like one of the old-time Star Wars villains - which is positive, of course. Samuel L. Jackson was - as usual - a BAD ASS MOTHAF***A! Heads up, Jango! Yoda shows us why he's the Master (terrific contrasts: in the beginning of the film he makes jokes in front of his little Padawans at Obi-Wans expense and praises the innocence of children and at the end, he just totally whupps ""Matrix""-style ass!) And watch out for Hayden Christensen's positively Pacino-esque ""I hate them!""-monologue. Powerful the dark side has become indeed.

"When C3PO loses his head and it ends up next to his body, he mutters ""I'm beside myself!""  That's a pretty good line.  I think there may have been another good line too, but nothing like the wry wit that was evident in episodes 4, 5 and 6.  I basically have the same complaint in this movie I had in Spiderman.  The CGI isn't all that good.  When Yoda is fighting, it looks as if a green rag is flopping around.  Slow it down and show us some technique, instead of dazzling us with speed. The light sabre fights between Luke and Darth Vader were much better.  On a happier note, Obi-Wan's character is right on, totally excellent. Anakin's role is that of a teenager ruled by hormones that get in his way. He has some interesting glares and looks, and his face is expressive.  I liked that, but to this point, I still see no motivation for him to go to the dark side.  Any warrior must know that he will have some disappointments in life, and Anakin doesn't seem to get it. Christopher Lee looked like he was watching CGI, his eyes didn't focus at all like they did in 'Lord of the Rings' when he battled Gandalf. This movie will appeal to the 15 to 30 age set, and that is wonderful.  I applaud Lucas for continuing the series and sticking to his themes, after all, if he hadn't started this, we would all be without many computer advances and interesting characters.  However, I do miss the pacing and characterizations of the 'earlier' episodes. I rated it an 8, but I was hoping for a 9.",0.3212063492063491,0.5359841269841271

"I already commented on this movie, but the more I think about it the worse it seems. I cannot even accept this as a star wars movie. This movie is just absolute crap. There is not one good thing about. First of all the acting is terrible. Hayden Christensen was such a terrible pick for Anakin. He was the last person that should've been picked. Natalie Portman was a lot better than Hayden, but she still has plenty of room for improvement. Samuel L. Jackson and Ewan Mcgregor were pretty much the only good actors. Now on to the dialouge. The dialouge is usually the worst part the of Star Wars movies and it is atrocious in this movie. To top it all off, there was almost less of a plot in this movie than in episode one. Basically everything in this movie couldn't have been handled in a worse way. The movie would be slightly better if Mace Windu fought Dooku instead of Yoda. Like I said in my other review the Yoda fight scene is laughable. Umm, why the heck would Yoda need a cane if the next minute he bopping and jumping impossibly well? I have to give this movie a bad review because it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and George Lucas really needs to get someone else to write the dialouge. In episode five he had someone else do the dialouge and that is the best of the whole saga. To finish this movie is abysmal. 1/10",-0.09401041666666665,0.5768229166666666

"Well folks, I have just returned from the premiere here in Riga and if I might say it in one word - THE FILMS IS FANTASTIC. The early critics and press that said that the force is STRONG with this one were right! Completely! Or Almost... But first the good bits: A) The film completely satisfies both in term of action, eye candy and just everything you hear and see. B) It's definately stronger than PHANTOM MENACE and it really shows to a die hard STAR WARS fan, what a good star wars movie can be. This film definately worth seeing. I try to avoid spoilers, but there were just everything you, a star wars fan need: lots of action, cool fx, the scale of everything is fantastic, the love story behind is great. You'll love the moments when you see Jango Fett vs. Obi Wan. You'll love fighting Joda as much as fighting Samuel L. Jackson. Good acting of Hayden Christensen, now showing his anger and probably future look of Darth Vader (hope this is not a spoiler). Despite the fact that this movie rules 100%, something is missing and it's very difficult to say what. 1) When you leave the movie, you get the feeling that it's incomplete, and it seems this way, as Joda say his final line, like it should be more of it. 2) All the cool things in the movie are not very long and you don't have enough time to enjoy the coolness of a certain moment. For example the Jango Fett fight or finale lighsaber duel - THEY ARE GOOD, but they seems to be short, far too short. They should have been more expanded. I love them and for me there is not enough time given to them. I could give more examples. 3) The whole movie you wait for something big, and when it seems to be coming- the movie ends. So that's of a minor complaints. But heck, bollocks to complaints. Go and see the movie! It's still rules.",0.19776225547502138,0.46804613825890434
I must start off by saying that I am a huge Star Wars fan and contrary to many reviews that i have read i did not like Episode 2 entirely.  It is above and beyond the shallow Episode One but that's not saying much. Episode 2 is almost equally as shallow filled with archetypes but no characters.  Plug in formula plot.  And so many special effects shots that you start to think that Lucas is making a cartoon with people in it.  Add to this that the editing is done with a meat clever and Lucas has almost no clue how to direct and you get this new era of Star Wars.  I'm not implying that the first three movies are works of perfection.  They have their flaws like all movies but they do offer something that these two new efforts don't; a sense that these characters actually exist in this world.  That they actually live and breathe day to day in this universe.  I don't fault the actors in not bringing life to the characters as much as i fault the writing.  The hammy dialogue doesn't sound like people talking but like people needing to say very little just to advance the plot which is necessary in order to show more effects.  ,0.16535636982065555,0.4998660070088641
"After Episode 1 I thought ""OK, the movie is crap, at least the episodes 2 and 3 can't get any worse..."". I was wrong.... This movie is the total destruction of the myth that Star Wars once was.... It seems to me George Lucas was trying to make a movie for people under the age of 15, which don't have any idea of the original star wars movies. The real fans can't be satisfied cause there are not enough of them to make the real big money. Episode One was bad, but this movie is even worse. It is just a normal love story accompanied by a few battles, where only lightsabres remind you of Star Wars. Oh yes, and special effects, lots of them, special effects where anyone could live without them... why do there have to be so many (not very good) rendered animals, so many landscapes generated by computers? What about just a bit of the old Star Wars style? The old masks looked far better than most of the rendered people in this movie.... This is NOT Star Wars anymore, this is crap.

Even the acting is not that great to be honest, and it is sad to see that this movie get's good scores only because it is called STAR WARS!

"I thought it was surprisingly good and much better than SW:E1. I really didn't expect much from the kid who played Anakin.  He looked like a ""pretty-boy"" and I doubted I would like him much.  But, surprise!  I did. I empathize with him, anyway.  I think the actor was well chosen.  He was a perfect blend of boy and man.  He did best when he was portraying the difficult emotions (love/hate/ambition) that will eventually turn him to the dark side.  It bodes well for the third movie. His character was weakest when dealing with the other Jedi.  I think being called me ""my young padua"" so many times would turn anyone to the dark side. No wonder he thinks Obi Wan is talking down to him. I was pretty impressed with the dynamics between Anakin and Padme.  It seemed pretty authentic.  I really believed Anakin's professions of love -- even that funny one about sand -- that one reminded me that he really is still partly a kid. The special effects were very sumptuous, and pretty darn cool, especially when used to describe the variety of life in that universe.  The different life forms, the different architecture, and the different ship types were all fascinating to observe. So, that's what I liked about it.  There were a few not so great points, however. I thought the battle scenes lacked coherency.  It was like they strung together a bunch of explosions and flying lightsabers.  When you can't follow individual fights within a battle, you can't identify with the combatants.  It just goes to show bigger isn't always better.  It made me miss the good ol' space battles from the original series.  There you saw the face of the pilot as he ran from a tie-fighter, then was saved by a friend (or he was vaporized). I think the Jedi Council is acting really inconsistently.  They know Anakin has a thing for Padme, but they keep on assigning him to spend time with her?  Yoda ""saw"" that Anakin was having a traumatic experience, but there was no kind of councilling?  I think the old saw about ""the dark side is clouding their sight"" (or whatever Count Dooku said) is a pretty feeble explanation.  So much for the great and powerful Jedi. Lastly, I hope they explain the ""Anakin will bring balance to the Force"" or whatever the Prophecy is supposed to be. Anyway, overall I liked it a lot.  I look forward to seeing Episode 3, especially since I know that they picked a good Anakin. Oh, as an aside, did you notice the variety of ethnic types they had represented in the actors?  Besides good ol' white, there was a South-east Asian (Indian?) woman playing the new queen of Naboo, an East Asian woman playing the shapechanger bounty hunter, several black characters (in the Jedi Council and Padme's body guards), a Hispanic actor in the Senate who will (in the next movie) be Leia's guardian, and a New Zealand actor of mixed heritage playing Jenga Fett.

"Here's my two cents concerning Attack of the Clones, George Lucas, and Star Wars.  I think what we have here is a movie that is technically superb, but with a weak script.  George Lucas is one of the greatest visionaries Hollywood has ever seen.  Without him, movies would still be in the stone ages.  However, that does not mean he could tell a good story.  If he only stuck to what he's good at, and left the script to someone else, he would still be a god right now.  What a shame.",0.385218253968254,0.6720238095238095
"The biggest gripe I had with this movie was Hayden Christensen's performance, coupled with the way his character was written.  Instead of Anakin being portrayed as a 20 year-old 'seemingly' mature young man struggling inside with his own 'dark' issues, he comes across as a 15 year-old brat whose voice hasn't changed yet.  His 10 year old Phantom Menace counterpart was more mature!  Since when is having temper tantrums considered to be an attractive quality?  When he yelled, 'It's all Obi-Wan's fault!'  I was like, 'What!  OK, I've had enough of him.  He needs a kick in the pants!', but they just had Padme fall for him even harder, which is totally beyond me.  I know Hayden is 21 years old in real life, but he is a very young looking 21.  He looks like he just got out of the 9th grade. They needed someone who looked older and could be more believable as a romantic lead and they should have written less hissy fits into the storyline (or how about no hissy fits at all?)....",0.21024999999999996,0.41850000000000004

"Star Wars: Episode 2-Attack of the Clones can be summarized in two words: AWE....SOME!  I absolutely love this film.  After being not so satisfied with the attempt of The Phantom Menace to bring back the Magic of the Force to the People, I welcomed this spectacular venture back into the mythos of what is Star Wars.  Watching the descent of Anakin Skywalker to the Darker Side of the Force was exquisite.  Hayden's portrayal of Anakin could not have been done better.  Padme was welcome eye-candy and a bit more fiesty this time around.  At least, now I see where Leia gets her attitude from. Mostly what made Episode 2 more like a Star Wars film was the rejoining of the droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO.  Seeing those two back together again(coverings and all) made it feel like one of the Original Trilogy films. The story was great, it answered a lot of questions for me and kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie.  I appreciate all the ""hidden eastereggs"" that have become well known throughout all of Lucas' films.

Hayden is a good actor, but Anakin, if he were real, would probably be a bit wooden.  He grew up a slave, was whisked away from his mother and placed into strict discipline and training.

The scenes of the paradise lake country (was it filmed on Italian Lakes???) are amazing, special effects of the city chase and last battle are inventive and spectacular. Despite lots of praises in media I did not notice any improvement in the script though. Moreover, I find that the second episode misses some irony that the first episode had.

The acting by the two leads, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, is laughable, and many in the audience I saw it with did just that.  It was that pathetic.  Even Ewan McGregor, who normally is a fine actor, fell on his face with his leaden lines.  You could hear his attempts at humor falling like so much dead weight in the silence of the audience.  While the story in general is interesting and it's fun to see how all the pieces fall into place, the absolutely amateurish quality of the writing can't be covered up by any amount of special effects (which, though excellent, are as usual way overdone).  If you must go see this, go with low or no expectations, and you won't be disappointed.  If, however, you really don't want to waste your money on making George even wealthier with no payoff for you, then go rent ""Dark Star"" by John Carpenter to see how to make an excellent, hilarious movie with no budget at all.",-0.014182194616977253,0.5712215320910974

The only reason I had actually gone to see it was because of Ewan McGregor and Hayden Cristensen- I'd never watched a Star Wars movie before (Yes- I am a freak). Although most people have critised Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman's acting, I have to disagree. Regardless of whether or not Anakin's character lived up to all the fans' expectations of what Darth Vader should have been like when he was younger, Christensen did a superb job with his role. Hayden has a very unique way of acting that makes him stand out from all the other young actors and he really put a lot of emotion and realism in it and I could truly see him as a person, not just as a fictional character. The scene with his mother and the one where he is confessing to Padme are incredibly moving. Natalie, though she seemed a bit bored and stiff at times, was very good with her eyes. In the confession scene you can see all the terror and hurt she is going through when listening to Anakin talk about killing the Tuskens, while also seeing the compassion she is feeling for him and the instinct she has to comfort him.  Ewan McGregor is amazing as usual (too bad he didn't sing...:D) and brings a light touch of humor to all of his scenes.

The Phantom Menace was the biggest cinematic let down in history, I'm not denying that, but this... this film went further, deeper and it is for my money the most vapid, soulless and boring film of the entire Star Wars saga. I could go into detail here about the monotonous use of digital effects, terrible script, lack of plot, bad direction etc... but I believe Red Letter Media have done a very thorough job of that with their 70 minute reviews on YouTube and their own website. I would like to say that there is one scene in particular which has offended me since the first moment I saw it, and for my money summarises the shambles that are the Star Wars prequels; Yoda fights with a light sabre. As a child growing up in the 80s, Star Wars was the coolest thing to ever happen. I got the toys for Christmas, I worshipped the films and I feel so so so lucky to have had them as part of my youth. As an adult The Empire Strikes back remains one of the greatest films in my mind and have a great affection for it. It introduced us to Yoda and deeper into the ways of the force. When Luke gives up, says to Yoda ""you ask the impossible"", Yoda levitates the X wing the music swells and Luke at once realises the power of the force and that it transcends the physical limits of the world...

The music score by John Williams is very good and the action sequences(lightsaber duels) are well choreographed and are very fast paced and incredibly fun.I also enjoyed Obi Wan's character who wasn't developed but had a fun personality and was lovable because of McGregor's performance.The only character in the film who was kind of developed was Anakin who had suffered from some tragic events through the movie that changed him(that doesn't make him three dimensional and complex but it is still something).In a nutshell the movie is mediocre to bad ,sometimes boring and doesn't invest you into the story but has some things to enjoy.",-0.0679629629629629,0.5826851851851852

I think i'd definately oversaturated myself with internet gossip and trailers and finally my excitement at the movies release had faded to a bit of a blip during the last couple of weeks. So how is the movie? It seems to me that opinion will really be divided on this one - I for one, enjoyed The Phantom Menace more than this episode. The pacing choreography and tone were all better in TPM, especially the lightsaber duels and the brooding presence of Darth Maul. Here we have much looser choreography, Haydn is not much good with a lightsaber, Dooku seems far too old and cuddly - like Chris Lee in fact, to be truly threatening. Like TPM, AOTC may improve with viewings and will probably look better on DVD than at the cinema (as did TPM in my opinion). By the way remember Ewan's disturbing habit of putting on weight and changing his hairstyle in different scenes during the first film - now he changes beard density and age (you'll see what I mean or rather I hope you don't notice for your sake). Ultimately, I came out of AOTC feeling like i'd finally outgrown Star Wars and if the kids loved it then thats ok with me.

"It's evident that Lucas has lost his mind.  I've seen the movie twice to be sure of my opinion.  Hands down this is the worst acted and written soap opera set in space ever conceived.  The name ""Attack of the Clones"" is a misnomer in that the entire movie is the rambling between Natalie and the guy!  The attack of the clones happens about 2 hours into the movie which was a side bar to the movie if anything.  The digital visuals though ""very clear"" PALE in comparison to the visuals of the 1st three movies.  The Fifth Element already did the car chase scene 8 years ago! A clear failure of vision and CG technology.  This movie is a testament that acting, alien costumes and miniature model's cannot be replaced with CG graphics.  And moreover, visuals cannot carry a movie without acting or direction.  Wake up George.  You have too much money and the fact that you don't answer to anyone leaves us to suffer with your monolithic vision of how film should be made.  I can't help but remember Mark Hamill's comment about you in his biography, "" I have a sneaking suspicion that if there were a way to make movies without actors, George (Lucas) would do it.""

We're shown a few rooms, views through these rooms, views during chases that also feel bland, and not much else. The changes between scenery are appreciated, but not very well done, since we see very little of those different planets. They're just a backdrop. There is only one really intriguing part to the movie, and that is Obi Wan's journey into space to find a hidden space station. That's about it.

It all seems so predictable and cliche, and mostly referencing to other movies.

"In ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones "", Lucas goes back to basics: staying with a simple story and great special effects; ties several loose ends (or rather unanswered questions); and most importantly expands the story and sets up the next and final episode of the prequel trilogy. Reviewers were rather divided on the movie, some screaming ""A+"" and some screaming ""bloody hell"". Without a doubt this part is superior to ""Episode I"", with faster action, more spectacular special effects and more character development. And while I believe that critics nowadays are completely unreliable (consider the Sony Movie Studio's fake critic) and the major ones tend to vote in blocks (Olympic skating comes to mind), I do agree with one of the common arguments from the negative reviews: ""this movie will appeal much more to the true fan of ""Star Wars"" saga""... except that I find nothing NEGATIVE in that comment: Why in the world would anyone who is NOT a fan, ever go see Part II of a series?

Hayden Christiansen was a brilliant Anakin Skywalker, Ewan McGregor was great as usual and Yoda... well, see the movie yourself and giggle like a giddy school girl at Yoda.  Now, I am one of the few defenders of the Phantom Menace.  I think it was lighter than the other films because Lucas was trying to portray a much more peaceful time in the galaxy.  Yes, Jake ""Mannequin Skywalker"" Lloyd was not the greatest actor and yes, Jar Jar Binks brought out the dark side in us all.  But one thing I think happened was just what I said would happen. Phantom makes a lot more sense now!  Now we know that Jar Jar was there for a reason: (spoiler alert) To bring down the Republic!  The master plan of Darth Sidious is much more clear now, Anakin's path to the dark side has become more evident, and the birth of the Empire is imminent.  I think I can slip my Episode 1 dvd in now and breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that Lucas, the emperor himself, has everything mapped out and everything is going according to plan.  So I urge everyone to see Attack of the Clones and if you didn't like Phantom, go back and watch it again after seeing this great movie.

Compared to the lively original films [the first two, anyway], this is like a Star Wars film sapped of everything good.  The series is dead but the good news is there is only one left.

The film takes place ten years after the events that occurred in Episode I, in which Anakin has grown older and has become Obi Wan Kenobis jedi apprentice.  Most of the characters from Episode One return in this movie, however Jar Jar Bink has a rather short but important role in Episode II.  This film reveals the life of Anakin Skywalker while he is in the process of becoming corrupt by power and anger as well as it being more of a love story. Samuel L Jackson and Ewan McGregor are awesome in this movie, but Yoda steals the entire film.  The droids also have a solid role in this film.

"George Lucas returns to his roots and produces the second best Star Wars movie overall (after The Empire Strikes Back).  The action, adventure, sense of wonder and sense of humor which were noticeably absent from The Phantom Menace (except in parts) are all back with a vengeance.  Thankfully, Jar Jar Binks screen time is limited, though oddly enough his time on screen still managed to be so awkward and hackneyed that it made me wince.  By far, however, the biggest reason why AOTC cannot score higher than an 8 out 10 in this reviewer's mind is due to the idiotic dialogue between Amadala and Anakin during their love scenes.  The scripting in these parts is absolutely horrible to the point that my date and I were literally laughing out loud during the scenes.  In some movies if a scene doesn't go over right it can make you squirm or even feel a little embarrassed.  The dialogue and, consequently, the acting in these love scenes was so bad that all we could do was shake our heads and laugh.  From what we could tell, everyone else in the packed theater felt exactly the same way with several people giggling, shaking their heads, or simply resting their heads in their hands trying to hide their eyes.  Lucas is a genius at times when it comes to dreaming up these far away locales and the action scenes in this film are incredible and very impressive.  But he needs to face facts: the guy does not have even a simple grasp of what a love scene should sound like or how two people in love should talk to each other.  Granted, we're talking about a distant galaxy where customs and speech patterns could realistically be quite different than ours, but that isn't the problem.  The problem is that it is just CHEESEY.  Regardless of anything else, you have to be able to appeal to the audience of today...and people today, for the most part, aren't going to take that kind of crap seriously.  When Anakin says to Amadala, ""I don't like sand...it's course...and it gets everywhere.  It's not like you...you're everything that is soft - and smooth"" it was all I could do to keep myself from literally rolling out of my seat.  My girlfriend and I, along with the rest of the theater sat there slack-jawed that the dialogue was that cheesey.  Believe me, there is a reason I have gone off on this one point for so long: it dropped an otherwise ""almost perfect"" movie down a couple of big notches.  If Lucas had any humility and could recognize his weaknesses as a screen-writer he would have brought in some help to re-write those scenes and to try to form a real bond and romance between the two main characters.  It would have made an otherwise very good, very entertaining movie nearly perfect.",0.15090371368673258,0.49097634022162323
"The biggest expectation for this movie was to be better than its predecessor The Phantom Menace.  It has fulfilled that expectation yet in all other aspects this movie lacks greatly.  Star Wars fans may have been dreading the love story.  Their dread is well-founded especially considering the love story is built upon poorly written dialogue, sub-par acting from good actors and special effects that are not so special.  The computer generated backgrounds are definitely not up to par with the old movies which is a shame.  The fighting sequences involve way too many people and a ridiculous amount of quick cuts and panning.  The film moves along sluggishly and spends a long time unsuccessfully trying to convince us we should care about the Anakin and Padme love story.  The last half hour is probably the only redeeming aspect of the film as plot and action finally start moving.  The best light sabre fight scene takes place within this half hour and is probably also the most surprising scene.  The end made me wish the movie was longer while the beginning made me wish the movie would end.  This is by no means a horrible movie, but by the same token it is not a good one.  George Lucas should use the help of Lawrence Kasdan and anyone else who may want to lend a hand for the next one if he expects it to be up to par with the original trilogy.",0.18032212885154061,0.5100840336134453

"Maybe I'm getting inured to the hype of StarWars or maybe the quality is really deteriorating, which ever the case maybe, this particular episode of the saga was a bit of a downer. Yes it has all the glitzy animated creatures/ machines blah blah. But this series was supposed to concentrate on bringing up the characters of Anakin, Padme and to throw light on the reign of the dark side. I totally disagree with the choice of Hayden as Anakin(yes he's supposed to be one of the better looking people as per some magazine) but that still does not upgrade his acting skill which I found wooden and a bit trite. His accent also threw me off as it stilted his line delivery. But then again I did notice a rather racial bias against people of other countries(all the bad characters had accents that  we obviously can associate with certain non-american people). All good-white, all bad-asian, south american. However I seem to be rambling on... anyway the initial action scene was a hackneyed scene and didn't impress me at all (too much attention was paid to this scene) and then the action thing just died down, It seemed that Lucas ran out of ideas after this and just put together one hackneyed scene after another. However this does bring all the pieces together of the starwars saga. A one-time watch for me unlike the other starwars episodes...",0.03291562238930661,0.3189640768588136
"First, I thoroughly enjoyed watching Star Wars, Episode II - the visual effects were spectacular, and though I had seen the first installment, I would have appreciated it just as much with no prior Star Wars knowledge. It says something about George Lucas that he can make it supply the vital links between parts past and future, as well as making the film a decent stand-alone piece. The film also made me laugh. Star Wars purists would be appalled by this - surely the genre is meant to be full of meaning, metaphor and sincerity. I'm more flexible myself, however there are only so many times that yet another character or force joins a single battle (which we had been led to believe was won, yet again) before it descends into something slightly ridiculous. The cinema erupted in hysterics in master yoda's fight scene - surely not the intention of the director? I think maybe Lucas was trying too hard to 'fill in the gaps' and provide viewers with an easy guide to who's going to be who in future - Obi Wan's comment to his troublesome pupil 'you're going to be the death of me' after a high-octane chase scene bordered on the poststructuralist surreal.  Having said that, though, I appreciate Lucas had a difficult job to do, which he performed to aplomb - making the movie exciting when anyone who has seen 'Star Wars' (don't read on if you haven't) knows damn well that Obi Wan, Yoda and Anakin will survive in order to feature in the original films. Despite knowing that she must survive in order to conceive Luke, I was still enthralled watching Senator Amidala's struggle to survive. In all, then, a film definitely worth watching - just suspend your sense of disbelief, and avoid being pedantic, and Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones is one of those films you can just sit back and enjoy, regardless of the occasional ludicrousies. Mind you, it would have been far better with some good acting - I am an actor and director myself and can imagine how hard it is to act against a character whose presence is only digitally added later, but even taking that into account, the standard of acting was, on the whole, sub-soap opera level, which even the cinema audience picked up on (more hysterical laughter) when Amidala suddenly and unconvincingly declared 'aaah...ahhh, er, I'm fine' on the desert sands towards the end. Nevertheless, a forcefully fun film to watch.",0.09810924369747898,0.46013849984438226

Why? because I really took a long thorough look at this film and put aside my harsh critique of it. I Loved the Battle at geonosis I was thinking alright! Laser War! what a feast for the eyes that was! I loved all the action scenes they were great. I loved all the characters Yoda doesn't look that bad, in fact he looks a hex of a lot more expressive and you tell me how he would have been able to do that Lightsabre Duel against Dooku if he was still the puppet; strings would be showing for sure. I Liked Hayden Christensen He has a james dean edge and what he lacks in expression he makes up for with his eyes they are are very expressive.

Personally I favor the interaction and development of the central characters. I think a more simple explanation is at the root of the emptiness of the last two episodes.... Poor casting. What was a regal bearing in Alec Guiness manifests itself as sensitive, fussy and even camp in Ewan McGregor. He doesn't cut it. Temuera Morrison gets past the special effects to deliver a good performance as does Christopher Lee and for that matter Samuel L. But Christensen has no charisma and he is the central character in this instalment. He lacks complexity in what could have been an excellent role for an edgey  young upstart.

"I found this to be a fairly bland and disappointing movie.  Nice set design, some very clever and creative effects and settings.  But, once you get past that, there are several problems.  First, there isn't any chemistry between the Portman character and Skywalker, who I found rather creepy, not sympathetic, and the dialogue between them is trite and their scenes together quickly became tiresome.  Also, I found the transitions between some scenes to be rather jarring, as though some intervening scenes might have been cut out in the editing process.  And the actions scenes feel rushed, just some staged set pieces with no build up, so no tension in them. I can't help but compare the very busy and noisy but uninvolving action scenes here with someone who knows how to stage a scene, like Michael Mann in Mohicans and Heat.

"I wish I could say that Attack of the Clones satisfied the void I've felt after being disappointed three years ago with The Phantom Menace.  But I can't.  I left the theater contemplating if I even enjoyed it more than Episode I.  As mediocre as Episode I was, I still left that movie feeling exhilarated after witnessing the best lightsaber battle ever.  I was a bit distraught that Darth Maul had died, but in the short time he was there he kicked major ass.  I had heard that the last 30 minutes of Episode II were intense and non-stop action.  I kept waiting for it.  Oh, there was action, but it barely raised my pulse.  And why?  Everybody else seemed to be enjoying themselves.  When the movie ended everybody cheered.  So why, why didn't I get that same enjoyment from the movie?  I know why.  It was a problem with Episode I and is even more apparent in this one.  It's what the Star Wars franchise has become, and unfortunately there's no way around it. What am I referring to?  Well, there was one word that kept popping into my mind the entire time while watching this movie: Artificial.  This wasn't a movie I was watching, this was all one big special effect.  Every scene and I mean EVERY scene just oozed computer trickery.  No matter how simple a scene might've been, it was ""touched up"" by the folks at Industrial Light & Magic.  But hey, this is ILM, the very best in the business right?  It shouldn't be a problem.  Oh, but it is.  I don't understand why, if George Lucas owns ILM, and this is freakin' Star Wars (the reason ILM was created), why then do the special effect look so sub-par.  Maybe one or two scenes were impressive, but it's hard to get ""into"" a movie when you can't believe what you're seeing on screen.  Sure, the Star Wars franchise has always depended on special effects - there's no way around that.  But in the original trilogy they were used to enhance the movie, they were not the movie itself.  And that's what Star Wars has become.  There's no heart anymore.  There's nothing ""real"".  It has become so artificial it's difficult to bond with the film.  The entire time while watching this movie I was wondering if anything was filmed on location.  Hell, I even would have taken sets.  Sound stages.  Anything that the actors could reach out and actually touch and interact with.  But no.  I'd say that 95% of this movie was filmed in front of a blue screen.  And it shows.  You can't blame the actor's for stale performances - it's hard to act when there's nothing there.  Can it be just me?  Am I the only one who can see just how fake everything looks?  In many scenes it was as if real actors were just inserted into a CG movie (which is essentially what it is).",0.08919234360410831,0.5480104263927795

The story is very complicated with several things happening at once; a detective-like story with Obi-Wan, a love story with Anakin and Amidala, political intrigue in the senate, what Count Dooku is up to, and of course why this film is called Attack of the Clones.  The action scenes are plentiful, and far more exciting then Spider-Man all the other Star Wars films as well.  We have a speeder chase through the streets of Couracent, a great fight scene between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, a space battle near asteroids, a chase though a conveyor belt, the Gladiaor-like execturiton arena, the all-out Jedi fight, thousands of clones and droids going at it, and last but not least a incredible fight at the end with Count Dooku and Yoda. There are some complaints I have about the film.  The acting was subpar on several occasions, especially Hayden Christenson.  The dialouge was laughably bad in more then one spot and the love story was poorly executed. I also felt that some of the action scenes were far too short; like the fight between Jango Fett and Obi-Wan, A climax fight with Jango Fett and Mace Windu, and most disappointing of all the light saber duel between Yoda and Count Dooku. Despite some probelms, Attack of the Clones was as good as anyone could expect it to be if not better.  George Lucas has done a film to be proud of.",0.25056689342403626,0.5749149659863947
"First, I am a fan of the Star Wars series. 'A New Hope' being the second movie I ever saw (when I was 6), I really did not have much of a choice. However, I am not a fan of biblical proportions. For example, although I know the Millennium Falcon will do .5 past light speed, I have never made myself up like Darth Maul. Nor do I have any delusions about the time-line inconsistencies of 'Empire' or the emotional emptiness and overuse of matte backdrops in 'Jedi'. I was also strikingly disappointed in 'Menace,' partly because it has several glaring inconsistencies with the events to come, but mostly because, despite its dazzling visuals, it was flat, with dialogue aimed at a 2nd grader, (i.e., - ""Coriscant, the entire planet is one big city,"" told to us as we are looking at the one big city. Lucas did not trust us enough to see the train when it was 2 feet in front of our noses and felt he had to clue us in on the obvious - insulting).",0.009607438016528929,0.36308539944903573

It's great to have a classic English actor playing a central role in a Star Wars film again.  I have to say that in the lead up to the film I wasn't convinced but well done to Hayden Christensen for pulling it off.  He has given the role of Anakin Skywalker the requisite brilliance, impetuousness and petulance that will ultimately lead him to the Dark Side of the Force.  Padme is again played almost as a ""mini-Leia"" by the gifted Natalie Portman (we await her performance in the last instalment of the trilogy).  The relationship between Anakin and Padme is dealt with tenderly and with clarity over their difficulties.  For very different reasons they struggle to deal with their feelings for one another.

This latest chapter seemed to focus more on a set up for the original trilogy, rather than telling a story.

I can not speak enough about how great this movie was.  The action was great and the story very complex and intriguing.,0.471,0.6519999999999999
"OK - so the title sounds campy, the dialogue is cheesy, and the production is designed to look larger than life. Now, are you ready for the really brilliant part? THAT'S THE POINT!!! (Note, some spoilers ahead, nothing too critical) If the first 20 minutes were any indication, then this might have been the greatest movie I've ever seen - if the first 20 minutes, highlighted by a speeder chase reminiscent of the ""Star Tours"" rides at the Disney Theme Parks, were any indication. Once the initial adrenaline rush fades, the next hour of the movie flips back and forth between a halfway intriguing detective story with Obi-Wan Kenobi, and a molasses-paced ""love"" story involving Anakin Skywalker and Padme. The whole point is to try and unravel who's out to kill Padme and destroy the Republic. The dialogue constructing most of these scenes was subpar, but not so nauseating that it killed the film. Maybe I'm not as prone to loathe a lot of said dialogue, since most of what Anakin threw out there sounds like what I would say: something awkward, naive, and juvenile. For the action scenes, the writing was no better or worse than ""The Matrix"" or ""Spider-Man"", especially when you consider each action scene in ""Spider-Man"" involved the stereotypical witness to the destruction pointing into the sky and screaming, ""LOOK, IT'S SPIDER-MAN!!"" Nevertheless, I enjoyed the film - the sum effect was easily able to outduel some of the slow parts, which would be just about any scene involving Natalie Portman. She looks good and all (though I do wonder if cable comes standard with those hairdos, of if she has to pay extra), but she just seems stiff and detached from everybody else. Example: near the end, when she finally decides to throw up her hands and say, `Sure Anakin, let's fall in love' (right before they're scheduled to be made into chop liver), she says `I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.' At least Anakin has the good sense to respond with a look of total confusion, letting us know we're not alone.  Maybe that's her fault; maybe it's Lucas' writing. Anyway, you can spend the film dissecting its `deep' dialogue and characters, or you can take in the scope and greatness of the design and effects, not to mention how incredibly badass Samuel L. Jackson is, and that Ewan McGregor holds his own as Obi Wan. The two droids (C-3PO and R2-D2) are once again in trouble which makes for good humor, and the design of the film is the work of some freakin' geniuses. Top it all off with the five coolest words of any Star Wars installment: Yoda in a fight scene. So some people like to ask `Why'. Me, I ask `Why not?'.  Movies are not about popularity (well, sometimes), not politics (well, sometimes), not money (well, all the time.) Sometimes, it's OK just to want a picture that gives you two hours of adventure and suspense in a darkened theater, an escape if you will. Such an attitude is a hallmark of the cheesy Flash Gordon serials of long ago, which planted the idea for a grand space opera in the mind of George Lucas. If what you really need from your sci-fi fantasy adventures is deep thought, character development, and `top of the line' acting, then I suggest you see a Star Trek movie. If I had to assign grades, I'd go  8/10, and I'll see it again.",0.13149481566820279,0.5042946748591909

"Man, this film blasted me off my feet!  And to think Episode I was eagerly awaited but this film was sold out all over the country for weeks!  So Ewan McGregor is back as Anakin Skywalker and with Obi-Wan Kenobi they set out to find out about some sort of cloning process going on on another planet. After Anakin's mother dies in his arms he is hell bent on gaining revenge and this is where it really kicks in!  The fight near the end is excellent, and especially the funny quotes Obi-Wan makes are unforgettable!  Anakin has his arm chopped off by a light saber and he marries the princess, and later they give birth to Luke Skywalker.  Although this film is called ATTACK OF THE CLONES, the clones only attack during the last 15 minutes of the film, so Episode III is really about the war (boy, I can't wait till that comes out!).  This film has some really advanced technology and buildings and computers (it must have cost a bomb to pay for it all!), and it is really interesting, your attention will never leave the screen once you get first glimpse.  10 out of 10.

"I've been keeping to myself about Episode I when I first saw it, because it truly disappointed me to know that this movie almost had no depth in it. I thought it was for the kids instead, entertaining them into the special effects and saber duels, which also goes for the Episode II release, and the only thing that excited me was Yoda's duel with Count Dooku. I admit, I was a kid when I saw Episode I and finally a teen at Episode II and was awed by it also, but I also reverred back to the original trilogy once I have gotten a hold of DVD release(thank god) and I just couldn't take it anymore. It pained me to know that Episodes I and II are terrible renditions of the much anticipated story of the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader, and forced me to question whether George Lucas had really thought this story out correctly or was he just too terrible a director. I understand that the originals were ground-breaking masterpieces that demanded audiences' surrender to its powerful prowess in story and effects, and I understand now that with all this digital tech, the awe-capturing effects aren't possible. But that shouldn't excuse Lucas from creating a powerful story. Yes, in Episode II, it had a little more depth than Episode I, but the actors killed the effect. Hayden Christensen doesn't belong to the role of Anakin.....AT ALL. Natalie Portman so far, hasn't shown any true on-screen assurance of why she fell in love with Anakin in the first place. And yes, Jar Jar Binks had absolutely NO part in the story and is not significant at all, let alone his annoying accent. The special effects were overused and a bit choppy in comparison to other films. Hayden hasn't portrayed a single ounce of cynical and maniacal feeling into Anakin's character, but instead shows us all the pissy-pants nature in a lot of teenagers these days. Ewan had the potential to put more ""wise-man"" into Obi-wan's character, but he didn't. Natalie Portman's love for Anakin was dry and doesn't deserve a mention. Not even the story had a powerful effect on me like the original trilogy did. All in all, this new trilogy deserves better, which means, serious actors, and under-used special effects, which will put more of that ""oomph!!"" into the once-powerful grabbing attention effect onto people.

"Episode 2 is undoubtedly better than the Phantom Menace, and continues the strengths of the first film whilst cutting down on the weaknesses. It is not however greater than any Star Wars Films other than its predecessor. Positives are once again the action sequences and special effects, but the real way Attack of the Clones improves on Episode One is by trimming away some of the unpopular areas of the first film. For example, there is far less of the first film's annoying and embarrassing comic relief, Jar Jar Binks, and slightly more action. Now for what I disliked about the film. First of all, George Lucas' dialogue has deteriorated even further than in the previous movie, and his story writing is uninspiring. There are some lines in Attack of the Clones which were too dreadful to fully comprehend on a first viewing. Performances in the film are, in most cases poor; Hayden Christensen, who portrays an older Anakin Skywalker, produces some of the most memorably awful acting that has ever graced the franchise, although shoddy dialogue could be argued as a root cause for the robotic performance Christensen gives. He and Natalie Portman's Padme Armidala engage in one of the most unconvincingly written romantic relationships in cinematic history, not helped by Portman's disappointing performance. Character development is once again missing, and you still can't get behind any of the main protagonists. At least on a positive note, we see Samuel L. Jackson's Mace Windu and Master Yoda get action scenes, and an antagonist superior to Darth Maul in Count Dooku, as portrayed by the late Christopher Lee.

C-3PO is back in all his wit, or is that witlessness?  One of my few critiques would be that at a particularly somber moment, 3PO chimed in with a bit of humor that was great but mis-timed.  Many lines oozed with doom knowing what is to come.  Since this was demonstrated in the trailer, I don't think it's a spoiler, but read cautiously - at first, when I heard how Anakin whines in the trailer, I was frustrated, ""That's just like Luke,"" I thought.

Though Phantom Menace didnt have a good one, this 2nd episode has created the 'missing link' tighter between the episodes of 5-7 and 1.

What people didnt get it is, this is what it's supposed to be. But what i felt, Mr. Lucas did remarkably well was the scene of Yoda (all of it), as it brings higher level of wat people r gonna see Yoda (in his character) on Empire and Return of the Jedi and the conspiracy scenes. As classical and powerful as GODFATHER's revelations. Everybody did a great job, even the extras, tech and all (but im still waiting for John William to deliver a KILLER score as unforgettable as episode 1,4,5,6).

"As much as I would love to be able to say that Attack of The Clones is as good as the original three in the series, I sadly cannot.  And even more dissapointing is the realization that the prequels will never reach the type of cinematic enjoyment that the first three did. It's just not going to happen. But don't get me wrong.  Attack of The Clones is not a bad movie. It is much better then the Phantom Menace and gives us much more insight into how the Republic falls and the Empire takes over. THE GOOD:  Every scene with Palpatine is awesome.  Watching the character continue to manipulate the Jedi is fun to watch and you can tell that Ian McDiarmid is having fun playing the character. His early scene with Anakin gives us insight into the relationship the two have built since we last saw them in The Phantom Menace and when Palpatine talks about how he loves Democracy and loves the Republic it is develish evil we hear in his undertones. When Palpatine finally reveals himself as Darth Sidious in Episode III, it is going to be an awesome moment. Anakins slaughter of the Tusken Raiders camp is cool and his scene after where he tells Amidala what he did is easily the best acting scene in the Prequels.  We finally see Darth Vader in Anakins eyes and it is very compelling. Also memorable: The chase through Coruscant, Kenobi vs. Jango Fett, The Battle Scene at Geonosis, parts of the C-3PO and R2-D2 antics during the big battle scene, watching Count Dooku escape on his scooter across the desert as he is being followed by Anakin and Obi Wan (am I mistaken or did the soundtrack have undertones of the Wicked Witch of the West theme from the Wizard of Oz as Dooku is on his broom err scooter.). The BAD: The two most difficult things for a director to convey are tone and subtlety.  Lucas fails to convey both of these.  Sadly this movie that should be full of energy and emotion is dead.  Instead of experiencing the movie with the characters we are observers. This is mainly due to the weak dialogue and stale directing by Lucas.  The Flanneled One is much more interested in computer effects then he is in character development.  This is the biggest missing ingredient that seperates Episode I and II from the first three.  Also, the editing choices in the film were questionable at times.  There  is little to no tension built through out the story.  It never builds to anything emotional, it just moves on to the next scene, the next plot point.  Some scenes should have been cut out all together. The UGLY:  Anakins scene with Amidala by the fireplace is truly horrible.  The writing is sophomoric and its really quite embarrassing for both actors.  Lucas then follows this scene with what has to be the worst scene of the movie which is Anakin having a nightmare about his mother.  This scene would have worked if Lucas would have shown us a glimpse of what his dream was about and it would have served to re-aquaint the audience with Shmi before we see her death scene.  Sadly, no one mentioned this to Lucas and the scene plays horribly.  I saw the movie twice on opening day and this scene got laughs both times. All in all the movie has a lot  more good in it then bad. However I couldn't help feeling that as Palpatine and others watch the Clone Army board the Star Destroyers and The Imperial March is playing it should have been the emotional climax of the film instead of just another visual spectacle. 7.5 out of 10 but I'll round it up to 8 since it's Star Wars :-)",0.0493880208333333,0.5690885416666667

Other than wanting to know the storyline for the entire anthology, I'd never want to watch this movie for even just a few minutes.

Please, don't even attempt to philosophize that the EP. 5 title is superior.  People have also criticized the romance between Amidala and Anakin as being unbelievable.  There is no one alive who can say with a straight face that the God awful romance development between Han Solo and Princess Leia was any more convincing. And the dry delivery of lines?

After 3 weeks or so of the release of episode II I decided to disregard my prejudices and go see the new Lucas addition to the Star Wars Saga, especially after reading good reviews about it.  To be honest, it was better than the Phantom Menace but still no where near as good as any of the old stuff.  The Characters are well defined and deep, and although I liked young `Any' my liking can't change the fact that the boy can't act, besides the image of little 'Any' in diapers being protected by Amidala made me  think along the lines of a `sinful' amoral relationship bit of child molesting on the former queen's side..ugghh.  The movie was a bit slow till the last 20 minutes. Too much animation made the set look unreal, and Youda was much bigger when he was a man in the empire strikes back.. and more real too.  In addition I would like to add a bit of `borrowing' Like the beginning of the movie the city looked very `blade runner' `the 5th element' kind.  The warms to kill the Senator were borrowed from the `Dune' Mini series, in addition to some of the beautiful Arab looking palaces in Nabu that was `Dune' too.  The asteroids field was very much `farscapish' a bit on the side of warmhole technology.

"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS I found this film infinatly better than The Phantom Menace. The people knocking this film are at fault here. This film succeeds on every level for me. The acting is not all that bad. It has never been a strong suit in any of the films despite having some great actors in them. The dialogue is another thing that is not always that great in any of the previous films. I thought that Hayden was quite good as Anakin. Sure some of his lines are cheesy, but you can't fault him for that. He excels in the scenes where he is allowed to show his arrogance and anger. Ewan McGregor was a little more comfortable with the Obi-Wan character this time around. If I were to change anything it would be the Obi-Wan/Jango Fett duel. It could have been longer. The conveyer belt scene just seems to commercial in the way of you know it will be part of a video game. The arena battle although was excellent I would have shortened it to make the Count Dooku/ Obi-Wan/Anakin/YODA battle longer. When it comes to that scene I will tell you that Christopher Lee is a much more menacing villain than Darth Maul. Secondly Yoda proves that big things come from small packages. A real crowd pleaser at the showing I just saw. Natalie Portman was given a better role. She no longer needs to be so stuffy as the Queen of Naboo. Again it isn't her fault for bad lines. Jar Jar Binks is there, but mercifully not much. C3PO is back in the form that you know him from the originals. With more than his share of corny puns. I would have to say that overall I enjoyed this film. Even the first hour that many are saying is slow. It may not be action packed, but it is still interesting. Things are falling into place. and it was great to see Obi-Wan following clues to find Jango Fett and all the things that come from finding him. If anything is missing it would be a Han Solo like character. The wise cracking devil may care attitude is not seen in this film at all. Another thing is the lack of any really good quotes. With the exception of two given by Obi-Wan.  ""Good Job"" as seen in one of the trailers and "" One day you'll be the death of me Anakin"".",0.18323643410852714,0.44780361757105946

There is not a single dull moment in this movie and it often left the audience cheering.  It has fantasy, drama, love, action, great score, great plot, great acting, great story line.  John William's score and its use was especially great. *Spoilers* When Anakin describes how he killed the kidnappers of his mom, we hear the Imperial theme for the first time in both the prequels. Throughout the movie, you can see how Anakin is driven further and further into hate and fear.  It was just a great movie all around and could possible rival some of the best movies ever made.

"It's 3 years since this came out now. Anakin has grown from a poncy, whining 8 year old, to a poncy whiney 19 year old. Obi Wan has grown his hair and Padme isn't as good as she was in Leon. The best bit is where Jango Fett headbutts MacGregor. I wanted to do the same. And there's a bit where Christopher Biggins as Count Dooku has a light sabre fight with a CGI Yoda, thats less photo-realistic than the one in the Clone Wars Animated Series. The thing that is most annoying is the romantic story between Anakin and Padme. It's such an important part of the entire saga, but only gets a few seconds here and there to develop. It seems it was more important to keep cutting to MacGregor talking to some more awful CGI 'characters', if you can call them that. It's okay though, because just when Padme has given Anakin, and the audience the feeling that he's barking up the wrong tree, she tells him she truly, deeply loves him.

"To get right to it, Attack of the Clones, Episode II, to me, is the weakest film in the saga. Now, don't get me wrong, there are moments that do stand out in the grand scope of the franchise, like the battle sequences and the lightsaber between Jedi Master Yoda and Count Dooku (which I do love). However, the dialogue between Anakin and Padme is really what kills me; it really is NOT good. I'm part of the minority that doesn't think Hayden did a bad job with Anakin, but his scenes with Natalie Portman can be hard to watch. Other than that, I do like the plot with the clones, although I wish Lucas would've made the decision to pick an actor to play Jango who sounded more like the actor who played Boba in the theathercial release of Empire Strikes Back, Christopher Lee as Count Dooku and, of course, Ewan McGregor's take on young Obi-Wan Kenobi!

Why oh why Mr Lucas? When I was a youngster I wanted to be like Obe-Wan when I hit about 60 and Yoda when I hit about 200. Why you ask. These guys were so noble and wise and every kid had this great respect for them. Episode 1 was bad enough but I was expecting better this time around but the hype pulled me in once again. Why am I so bitter. Kenobi was made out as a fool and Yoda was like a little toy who could pull off these weird moves. It was terrible. What was with that love story. Fair enough it had to happen but could Lucas have instilled some class into the putrid script. And what was with the scenery. Maybe I'm missing the point but i was expecting it all to look real.

"Just saw STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES today in a special screening here in Zurich, Switzerland. First of all I think that STAR WARS is the best ""movie"" and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is the best ""Star Wars-movie"" of the series. I also liked RETURN OF THE JEDI, although I (as everybody else) hated the Ewoks. I was dying to see THE PHANTOM MENACE and I even went to the US to see it on its second day of release. The waiting for the film was much better than the end-product itself. Although I kept defending TPM (great pod-race, suberb lightsaber duel, effects in general) I never thought of it as a good film and I truly hoped that George Lucas and his crew will somehow find a way to deliver a better film (story-, acting, humorwise). Now after seeing AOTC I am almost fully satisfied. The actors (especially Ewan McGregor) were more relaxed this time around, the dialogue was way better and even the love story worked for me (on a Star Wars level that is...). But I am not 100% satisfied though - and this never happened before, for my taste - with the Special effects. Some shots looked like matte shots of the eighties. But all in all I think that this is one of the top three Star Wars Films and I look forward to seeing AOTC a second time, seeing it on DVD (again and again) and seeing EPISODE III in May 2005.

"Very disappointing. Episode 1 got a going over but I thought this was far worse. The acting was risible (Christopher Lee aside), the early scenes excruciatingly boring and the dialogue pathetic in places. Lucas spent too much time trying to set the groundwork for the 1st (or should that be 2nd?!) great trilogy that he produced a plodding mess.  The early chase scene was incredulous, the romance unconvincing to say the least (could it have been any more hammy or clichéd?) and Christensen, in particular, absolutely brutal. In fairness, the ""Gladiator"" scene was excellent and it picked up considerably after that, but I almost had fallen asleep at that stage. And don't get me started on accents - we had a Scot doing a poncey (and fluctuating) English accent, various US & English accents and a Kiwi bounty hunter. Surely actors can act a bit and leave their parochial accents behind for a galactic extravaganza? At least McGregor tried, in going for the English accent, which appears to be the de facto accent for fine upstanding galactic citizens (go figure!). At least we saw little of that annoying Jar Jar and thats something to be thankful for. Come on George - you can do better than this.

With high expectations and a roaring full house, it was easy to tell that the congregation was impressed. AOTC is a huge improvement over TPM in terms of story, characters and tone yet  like EP1, it still had the flaw of woeful dialogue. With Lucas bringing on Jonathan Hales to flesh out the script, i would of expected better dialogue throughout the film, which brought much unintentional laughter. Although the humour was actually quite funny and there were some good lines, the writing and direction of the romance scenes was quite poor and proves Lucas as much to learn on executing chemistry with characters. Acting was good allround yet Christensen wasn't 100% capable of pulling off his role which to say, wasn't helped by his dialogue. It is easily seen any flaw of acting is contributed by actors not used to delivering amidst a wall of blue screens and with Lucas not having the best skills as helping actors blend their performances through the masses of fx surrounding them, the actors try their best.

"I really don't know how its happened that our entire country is full of critics and audiences suffering from severe sanity issues... but despite what they say... this movie is a bloody religious experience. Under the most intense scrutiny (which is just stupid to do), its the greatest popcorn movie ever made... and under viewing it simply because you want to, its easily one of the most fantastic romps through great movie-making ever conceived. If you're there for true emotional perfection then no, its not The Empire Strikes Back (which perfected perfection) but unless you're completely out of your mind (which I suspect these days many movie-goers and even fans are) you'll actually notice quiet a bit of really sincere, really well grounded emotion and character. When Anakin gets p***ed off... you want to be p***ed of with him. When Obi-Wan gets frustrated... hoo boy he's got good reasons. There have been the never-ending complaints over poor dialog, but I honestly didn't find this to be a problem; everything moved the story forward in complete harmony with what was happening and expressed exactly what needed to be expressed without ever becoming banal. For example, whenever Anakin tries to express his infatuation with Padme, what some might perceive as unrealistic drivel, I saw as ten years of uncontrollable obsession pitted against urgency -- he's a brash lad, and he is able to say exactly what anyone with the same feeling WISHES they could bring themselves to say. Yes, I suppose if you spend too much effort looking for problems you'll probably think the computer generated effects go back and forth from mega-superb to sub-par, but its easy to realize that in considering the scope of the story and events and such, there simply could have been no way for the technology to consistently keep up with the nearly limitless imagination and grandeur involved in this flick, and I for one am glad they didn't try to dumb some of the shots and visual ideas down to match only what they could create with the technology perfectly. Maybe I'm biased because I'm such a huge fan of the series... or maybe I simply know how to appreciate and recognize the uber-fantastic when I see it.

"This is a good movie... if you only watched it once. To make things simple, this is not a classic and does not (absolutely postively) deserve to be in the Star Wars trilogy. Sure, its better than 'The Phantom Menace' but what isn't? The characters were better used this time, thankfully, and Hayden Christensen did a wonderful portrayal of Anakin Skywalker which really balanced the otherwise tilting movie. A couple objections to the film... first, they should've shown more of Anakin's rampage on the raiders; i mean, not all in detail, but at least enough to make you cringe. Secondly, the romance between Anakin and Amidala just wasn't happenin'... i didn't feel the connection like I did with Leia and Solo in the original trilogies and I thought the two just didn't have chemistry. The main problem with this 'so called' love was that it based the whole movie on it when it only spanned a quartet of clips. At least with Leia and Solo, it wasn't hyped up and it just happened- if Lucas did not blow the love out of proportion maybe the movie might've been better. Nonetheless, nobody can forget Ewan McGregor's performance as Obi Wan also- who in my opinion was the cream of the crop here. Some shocking moments in this film that never really happened in any of the previous Star Wars films- i won't tell but has something to do with Jango Fett and Mace Windu. Definitely was creative and delivered quite well. Also, the final lightsaber sequence with Count Dooku... guess who came to the party? Yoda! I don't think Lucas intended on making the scene funny, but not one person in the theater the 1st time I saw it, did not laugh. I don't know how to make a critique on that except Lucas did something wrong there because I am confused whether its comical or normal. Anyways, the movie was alright but not something you would want sitting on a shelf beside the ""Star Wars"" or ""Empire Strikes Back"", that's for sure. Out of 10 stars, I give it a 6. Hopefully, the next film (Episode III) will bring out dorment ""true"" Star Wars fans like myself.",0.12266260162601626,0.5615224545102593

"The prequels are much maligned in some quarters and its easy to see why- They look fake and glossy, and nowhere is it as apparent as it is in Attack of the Clones. Another problem here is that this movie suffers from ""middle episode syndrome"" - the tendency of the second volume in a trilogy to feel incomplete and, as a result of that incompleteness, to fail to satisfy. Attack of the Clones takes the threadbare strands of plot introduced in The Phantom Menace and braids them together into what will eventually become the whole cloth for Revenge of the Sith. Still, despite several high-octane action sequences, this movie, more than any of the others in the entire Star Wars saga, feels orphaned and works considerably better when viewed as part of a greater epic than as a stand-alone production.

"Although marred by a lack of screen chemistry (and clumsy direction of romantic scenes) between Amidala and Annikan (although Annikan's fixation on Amidala is understandable, why Amidala would fall for Annikan is never established and comes across as just a deus ex machina), the film is saved by the solid individual performances of these two characters. Annikan's adolescent petulance is well-played but further deepens the mystery of why a successful adult woman would fall in love with him. The groundwork for Annikan's transition to the dark side is well laid down. But McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi is the star of this movie, and the film flows best through his scenes as McGregor fills out his role to a T, and is believable as a younger version of the Kenobi we meet in Episode IV. Jackson gives a strong supporting performance and Yoda steals the show near the end. Christopher Lee does well in refraining from overplaying his villain; Star Wars was never a place for the cartoonish bad guys with the clever quips a la a James Bond or Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. The movie is tightly paced as the main characters split up and jumps back and forth whenever things look in danger of slowing down. Well choreographed light saber, spaceship and battle scenes gives a visceral punch to the beautifully created worlds which felt so empty in The Phantom Menace.

I think Lucas has done well with a very tricky story and managed to keep the ideology of the trilogy alive. At times i felt the audience were shifted back and forth between scenes a little too much, in ep1 it built up alot before reaching the final climax, yet in ep2 the build up doesnt seem to link together as well. Id rate this just behind Empire as the best Star Wars film to date, for me it just seemed to miss something and be over too quickly.

It would have rave reviews, most critics would praise it... but for some reason ""star wars"" is already held higher than other movies. people expect too much these days. if you (re)watch the original trilogy, especially a new hope, you will find a lot of poor dialogue, plot flaws and certainly bad acting. this movie was extremely well done. the acting was superb. ewan mcgregor mimicks alec guiness to the key! Hayden Christensen is a good desgruntled anakin. i have seen other movies with him, and it seems this is the role he hits right on the nose. natalie portman was not only extremely sexy but developed as a character. instead of being the monotonous character from episode 1, she is a fun loving, emotional beauty. christopher lee plays both sides perfectly, but Ian McDiarmid does it even better. the visuals in this movie blow away spiderman, the matrix and any other ""blockbuster"" movies to be released. it easily blows away films unworthy of the best visual effects award. it even rivals the lord of the rings. the dialogue between the two lovers is exactly how most young adults act and talk. yes it is cheesy at times, but isn't that the way all young lovers are? the plot was *brilliant*. the jango fett/bobba fett relationship was ingenius. watching obi-wan on his investigation was fascinating. jar jar was *not* annoying at all. c3po and r2d2 almost stole the show, but the real person who stole it (and who will be remembered for it) is yoda! nothing, not even gandalf vs the balrog, can compare to yoda fighting. i was in pure ecstatic bliss and awe. is it better than episode one? hells ya! easily! better than jedi? for sure. better than the original? in my opinion yes. better than empire? it's a tough call, but considering that lucas had very little to work with since he *had* to get in many subplots to fill in episodes 4-6 (which, btw, worked perfectly, ie. lars owen) it definetely can rival it. there are *sooo* many parallels to episode 5 (empire) that are just wonderous to watch, and the cliffhanger finalé really makes me want a lot more. only 3 more years of waiting until the circle is complete. lucas has truly made a masterpiece. ps, i can't wait to see it on pure digital screen!",0.2716554898474541,0.5793219181612038

"When I saw the trailers for this film I was intrigued, actually anxious is the right adjective.  After I sat through all 2+ hours of this movie I have no idea why I was so anxious.  This movie was pretty much a chore to sit through.  Not that I hated every minute of it; the sound and special effects were amazing.  But, the movie fell flat on its face.  The story was good, the script was atrocious.  The dialogue was silly at times and the actors seemed to be lost in their delivery.  I think Lucas is a little out of touch with his directorial talents.  My biggest gripe is probably the overkill use of digital computer-generated animations.  While they may be cutting edge and may make things easier on the actors and budget, they take away from the real look the original movies had.  Yoda looked much more lifelike when he was a puppet ... also the clone army (stormtroopers of the future) weren't even real people.  At least they didn't look real to me.  Whatever happened to hiring guys to dress up in costumes instead of creating a fake ""cyber"" army.  Ridiculous.  Maybe if Lucas reverted to the technology he used back in the late seventies things would be better.  Those movies had a look to them that is totally lacking in the first two prequels.  The realistic touch and human side to the movies is gone and the digital dehumanized look of the new ones is just not welcome.  Try again George... but how about spending more money on little things like scripts and a good director.  May the force be with you.",0.035578310578310575,0.5423937173937174

It was dark, brooding, forboding, complex, well-paced, well-plotted and well-acted. I was impressed at the contrast between this movie and the first.  The Phantom Menace played like the Star Wars Kid's TV Special, while Attack of the Clones is of epic proportions, on a par with Greek tragedy (not to say it was a great movie---though it was very good---but it at least TRIED to be great). Even the special effects were 100% better than TPM.  The CGI looked absolutely real in this movie...I couldn't tell from looking where the live action left off and the CGI began.

Jar Jar Binks, dragged the ATOC's predecessor down that far. One improvement in Attack of The Clones is that Jar Jar has roughly five minutes in the whole movie which is a great improvement.

Star Wars Episode II Attack of The Clones, though it had some minor flaws, was an excellent film as far as Star Wars movies go. It was a gigantic improvement over The Phantom Menace, which was not horrible, just not wonderful either. (too aimed towards small children) ATOC has a good solid plot, great action, a considerably lesser amount of Jar Jar, and also better charecter development than its predecessor, The Phantom Menace. These when put together make Attack of the Clones a milestone in both of the Star Wars trilogies.

Some main points: 1)Hey George. Lay of the computer graphics. Go back to using models.

Those super sleek, shiny ships look out of place compared to the original M. Falcon and tie fighters. 3)The characters are way too serious. (Remember from The Empire Strikes Back that the young Obi-Wan had a reputation of being a problemed, rebellious student.) Now that we have the chance to see the young Obi-Wan, where is he? Ewan McGregor is way too straight-laced (he is normally a fascinating actor.) 4)Anakin comes off as a spoiled, whiny, jerk. We are supposed to see a character arc into Darth Vader, but let me tell you...Anakin doesn't have far to go. He is naturally unlikable. Finally, where is the humor??

Then I watched Clones on video, and it hit me how truly awful this was. Now I didn't have the eye candy on the scale that the theatre provides...it was just me, my wife, and a lame story filled with very lame acting playing out on a 27"" screen. And it didn't work at all. I even think it might be as bad or worse than Ep. I, which I didn't think was possible. There is no lead-in for me to eagerly anticipate Episode III - only the morbid curiosity of gawking at a train wreck. The story did nothing to endear me to the characters or care about their plights. Wooden, terrible acting by Portman and her beau. These films (I & II) desperately needed some comic relief ala Hans Solo to take the attention away from the stiff, lovey-dovey crap, but there was none to be had, so I had to sit through a lot of awkward, even mind-numbingly bad moments while the two young lovers worked through their feelings.

But nevertheless, we feel like there is an objective or a finish point that the movie seeks. The action sequences are improved, but still barely above average, except the final battle. The final battle is well filmed and visualized, and best of all feels necessary and not forced. The weakness in this movie, ironically is the main character; Anakin Skywalker. At times, you would find yourself rooting against him, which is a big flaw in any movie. Anakin's dialogue and Hayden's acting abilities make it seem like a fan movie could achieve better. The whole Naboo sequence is out of place, and the love story felt really forced and unnatural at all.

"I am awfully sorry, but I was really hoping that Clones would be better than Menace and it wasn't.  I thought it was 45 minutes too long, too dreary, too confusing and the action too concentrated at the end...and worst of all, I didn't care what happened.  Oh...and that Anakin bloke really began to get on my nerves, especially as he was out-acted by the scenery.  Sorry!  I am 41 and maybe seeing Episode IV 25 years ago spoiled me!",-0.16312500000000002,0.5800000000000001
"I think the general consensus of The Phantom Menace was that it was a fairly enjoyable load of rubbish. Light-hearted nonsense which had a slight comic-book approach. The idea of Attack of the Clones was that it was a touch darker, a bit more brooding. Well, after finally having seen this my verdict was that while the basic story was generally strong, and the special effects absolutely brilliant in places, there were a number of glaring weaknesses which moderately crippled it. The strengths were that it felt far more like Star Wars than the previous effort - the scenery was breathtaking and it encompassed the 'familiar yet alien world' that Star Wars has always used.

"I had great expectations about this movie as i had heard a lot of good things about it. It was quite good, but not nearly as good as the original three. The characters are just a bit two dimensional. I thought the script was quite good though, it wasn't too cheesy although there were a few bits of dialogue that had been heard before in the other movies. The acting was good but not excellent. And the story seemed very drawn out in places and it didn't really join together that well. The special effects were amazing though, and the final few battle scenes are very good. This movie just didn't satisfy me i only wish that it had.",0.21835714285714286,0.5913214285714286

"It doesn't take much, however, to be better than the other 4 movies.  You need to suspend disbelief of even the most astute disbelief at several points of this movie.  Notably (or should I say regrettably):  1.  All the times where Anakin openly disrespects Obi-Wan.  Good grief - there must have been SOME discipline in his 10 years of training.  2.  A senator in a republic 'appointing' a useless toolbag to sit in for her and instigate legislation that will ultimately bring years of war.  3.  Public executions being held in a tremendous outside arena (where did the rain go?) and in medieval fashion.  Why didn't Dooku just kill Obi-Wan when he was in bondage?  4.  Amidala falling out of a moving vehicle, knocking herself unconscious, then suddenly waking up and running to save Anakin.  Right. 5. Why does Yoda limp around if he's as agile and dexterous as we see in the fight scene?  I personally thought the final fight scene was lame, and should have lasted longer between Anakin/Obi Wan and Dooku.  6.  The 'Sound of Music' coming-over-the-hills scene with Anakin and Amidala.",0.08576190476190479,0.45909523809523817
"No words can do this movie justice.  Simply amazing.  Anyone who doubts George Lucas is clearly a fool.

I'm not not a Star Wars fan to start off. While I like the movies they have never been something that is in my movie collection. I will say that I plan on purchasing the Episode II as fast as its available. I thought the pacing slow in some points but the special effects eye candy more then make up for slow pacing. My stand out favorite scenes are with Yoda. Gave it a 9. Great movie.,0.2696428571428572,0.5776785714285715
"Being a rather big STAR WARS fan, i was extremely happy when viewing this film.  It fit nicely with the OT (original trilogy) by using many more inclosed sets.  It was as big and open as TPM was.  It captured the same essence and 'force' that Episodes 4, 5, & 6 all have.  It's filled with emotion and wonderful shots of the start of the CLONE WARS.  Anakin is nearing his faithful down fall to Vader.  Obi-Wan is becoming more and more of that mindful old man we see in A NEW HOPE.  This film has it all, including many good jokes/puns by C-3PO near the end, which makes the line ""WITH ALL THAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH, IT'S AMAZING WE'RE IN AS GOOD OF CONDITION AS WE ARE"" in EPISODE 4 more understandable and reminisciant.",0.38357533670033667,0.5486847643097643
"After being a huge Star Wars fan since I was old enough to walk, it's no surprise that I saw Star Wars Episode II in it's entirety within it's first 3 days of release 3 times. I saw Episode I 3 times too, just in over 4 months instead of 3 days. Needless to say, Episode II jumps leaps and bounds over Episode I. This is the Star Wars movie everyone has wanted to see. Star Wars was meant to be dark, and best when darkest (ex. The Empire Strikes Back), and Episode II is the start of a dark era in the series, and if done as it truly should be, Episode III should make things downright evil. While ""Attack of the Clones"" isn't a good point for outstanding dialogue, it is a story to be told, and one that is visual nirvana. You see Anakin going bad, Jango Fett and the origin of Boba Fett, and yes, you finally will get to see Yoda fight! What more can a Star Wars fan ask for?",0.059375000000000004,0.5421875
Episode II: Attack of the Clones is fine sci-fi entertainment and a definite improvement on its predecessor. But does it deserve the Star Wars brand name?,0.20833333333333334,0.5
"From the first words spoken in the movie where Padme's bodyguard says a variant of the classically crass ""we're safe"" or ""looks like we've lost them"" phrase, which comes briefly before the blatantly obvious explosion, the viewer becomes painfully aware that Lucas should be making silent movies. I can't remember precisely what it was Harrison Ford once said of George Lucas, but it was along the lines of ""If he [Lucas] could find a way to remove actors from the movie-making process then he would"". This is just one person voicing an opinion that it's difficult not to share when seeing Attack of the Clones. He has absolutely no conception of humanity. Of course I don't know George Lucas personally, but if I did I think that I would think that he is socially inept. If his real-life social interactions are the same as how he shows them in this movie, then there is something wrong with him. In Attack of the Clones he has somehow taken a group of very talented actors, and made them look like animated manakins. The class of Christopher Lee shows through this as, even in the face of such calamatous directing and script-writing, he still manages to deliver a powerful and eery performance as the Count Dooku. Overall I still enjoyed watching the movie, mainly I think because I am a die-hard Star Wars fan, but I couldn't help but cringe during every dialog. The love that was shown in the making of the first three Star Wars movies seems well and truly lost. The freshness of the relationship between Han Solo and Princess Leia is only a distant memory when we are forced to watch the ridiculously crass and predictable relationship of Anakin and Padme. Whereas the first three Star Wars films were made by a man who desperately wanted to put an idea into the world, the most recent two (and presumably the next one) will have been made by a man trying to squeeze a few extra millions out of an idea that should have been left as it was...",0.055833333333333304,0.44375
"I was not having very high expectations for this movie. After the horrible Episode I, I was worried if the series was going to be lost forever. After seeing Attack Of The Clones, I was rather more pleased. This film delivers the goods enough to make it worthy of being recognized as a Star Wars film. It is good to say we can think that Episode I probably never existed! This film has far more ties with the origional three than Episode I ever will. It harkens back to darker themes, primarily conspiracy, assassination, forbidden love, and war. The film runs about 2 and a 1/2 hours, and is breathlessly filled with awesome action and adventure. It has some chills, and thrills, and top notch effects that make Episode I look like childs play. As the only spoiler I'll mention, Jar Jar Binks is only in the film for four minutes, and his pathetic comic antics have NO MAJOR ROLE in this film! I think Lucas payed attention when the real fans that scorned Jar Jar for the stupidity he represents. The real comic substance of Artoo D2 and Threepio makes a triumphant return in this film! The acting has a mixed feel to me. Some of it was done well Hayden Christiansen. He dose bring the troubled Anakin Skywalker out well in some scenes. Some of the time he acts too much like a complaining teen. Natalie Portman portrays a better Padme. She is more daring and mature in this film. She has dispensed her monotone lines for a more diversified language that we all speak. She also plays more into how princess Leia' s personality is. Ewan Mcgregor is still a top notch Jedi. He hits a home run for his role. Christopher Lee as the sinister Darth Tyranus is also top notch! He is cold, calm, yet very taunting and ruthless. Samuel L Jackson also hits a major home run as Mace Windu! Some lines of the film are a little cheesy, but adequate. Lucas dose need to iron out harder performances if he wants to equal Empire Strikes Back. The action in all the battle scenes, and chases, all payoff very well. They have the full adrenaline rush of the other films. You harldy have time to catch your breath! The story is ironed out well with this film and plays well with it! For people who go to see film for crtical purposes, shut up and enjoy! Don't spoil it for those who just want to have fun at the movies. It may have subtle flaws, and it might not be equal to the origionals, but it is a repenting prayer for the mistakes of Episode I.

There are a few problems with the script, and the acting is stiff in places, but George Lucas has, for the most part, succeeded with creating a visually compelling, dramatically focused, and very emotional film.

"Just like all the other star wars films, this is a highly entertaining and interesting film.  It transports the audience into an amazing story by using incredible scenery, costumes, effects, sounds, and music.  The only legitimate complaints are with script and overuse of CGI.  When comparing to the original trilogy, there is a slight lessening of identifiable characters.  The prequels have more emphasis on politics and the tonality of the dialogue is more monotonous.  The story is still strong but unlike the originals, the dialogue is a bit weak to carry the story.  The CGI is amazing to watch and the detractors are correct when claiming this movie to be like a video game.  However, what is disregarded is that films combining CGI and real physicality are kind of new.   For this dilemma, a real-model/CGI combo should be suggested.  After all, there is something magical about the models and puppets seen in the originals and ILM can create some of the most astounding CGI.  Still, this slight degradation of quality in terms of script and overuse of CGI should be accepted because nothing has come close to a production with this scope and diligence to continuity.",0.28688016528925614,0.6259641873278238

Its like they had a specific spot off in the distance somewhere and told her to stare at in and deliver her lines with as little personality as possible.  How is Padme?  Unless in episode 3, it is discoverd that she is a robot or a clone. This is just one exmple I picked of how aweful this movie is.  Is is emotionaless, dull, unoriginal, painful.

Come on lets get real, Hayden delivers Every line is like he is reading a cue card, on top of that some places he sounds like he doesnt even care.  Portman is the same, says everything in mono-tone and does the same thing Hayden does, and there is no Chemistry whatsoever between them.  Everyone else is AWESOME in it, my next complaint is the lines given to Hayden, he sounds Whiney, his character whines alot and its repetitive.  The plot is better in this movie, But BY NO MEANS IS IT BETTER THAN EMPIRE!!!!!!  Some parts lag and drag out, I almost fell asleep, Obi Wan (I usually dislike Ewan Mcgregor) playing detective stole the movie, it actually out shines the love story.  Beware the Love story in this movie isn't like the one in Titanic, so dont expect that.

"Thank god for all of us out there! Due to our over all displeasure with so many aspects of Episode I George Lucas has listened and delivered a true winner! An almost complete lack of Jar Jar Binks, increased action sequences, better acting and actors and most importantly a much better script. The film is not without its flaws, but never the less it is quite an achievment that all will enjoy. Personally I still feel that ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" are superior but this film far supercedes ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Return Of The Jedi."" With plotlines being carefully interwoven, loose ends being tightened up and new questions being raised I feel this feel will stand the test of time and prove that George Lucas has indeed not lost his touch.

The 'love' between young Darth & Portman is appalling ..'you're not like sand, sand is coarse..' etc, his transition to evil simply not credible. How sad to see something die like this; Star Wars used to be fun. When I look at the films I saw as a kid, there's no comparison. Who writes this stuff? I don't think I'll bother with Episode III at the cinema. Of course there will be a tidal wave of hype; you must see it at the cinema, it's better than the last two and so on, but it won't make any impression on me.

"After putting us through the Phantom Menace Lucas is starting to get it right with this, but its still some way off the original trio. AOTC is not a complete waste of time, the battles are good and the story is starting to fit together with the originals nicely. But there is more to dislike, the original films had character, charm  and magic in spades and these prequels are sterile and life-less in comparison. This is down to the rubbish characters, Portman and Christensen are awful at best as the main focus of this movie (acting and dialogue), only McGregory pulls his weight and his detective work in the first half keeps the film watchable. The CGI is the other main problem here. It might work on droids and space battles but the aliens and backgrounds just look bad, the bit in the droid factory feels like it was added so Lucas could churn out a video game based on it (it looks like a game already) and Yoda looks like and extra from Toy Story.

"Contains Spoilers!!! I remember when the first 3 Star Wars movies came out, reading several times that George Lucas intended them to be the middle 3 films of a 9 film series. The next 3 films would deal with events before ""A New Hope"" and the last 3 would cover what happens after ""Return of the Jedi.""  When ""Phantom Menace"" came out I then heard he never said that--i guess it was just a rumor--and only wanted to do the original 3 movies.  Considering the troubles he went through just to get a studio to produce ""Star Wars"" it makes sense.  The script was turned down by every major studio in Hollywood, and only bought by 20th Century Fox because of the success they had with the Planet of the Apes movies, and also because the studio head, David Ladd, was a big fan of both ""American Graffiti"" and science fiction (he later formed his own studio which produced ""Outland"" and ""Blade Runner"").",0.0922534165181224,0.3231431966726084

"George Lucas is in danger of becoming the C.B. deMille or Stanley Kramer of his generation: a producer who insists on miscasting himself in the director's chair.  This picture shows off what George does best - creating eye defying visuals of a fantasy landscape.  Some of the vistas in this film - the cityscape, the clone factory and the terrain rushing by in the final chase are truly breathtaking.  Unfortunately we also get George at his worst - writing clunky dialogue and failing to coax even moderately engaging perfs from his attractive and talented cast.  Okay, Hayden Christensen lacks for talent, but the rest of the cast should have carried even him.  The result is a fantastic looking, but dramatically frustrating film. I wanted the leads to shut up and quit blocking the scenery - never a good sign in a film where the central romantic plotline is crucial to the overall drama.",0.17647058823529416,0.7294117647058824
"Maybe I'm in a minority but I really didn't think this was an improvement on the hugely disappointing Phantom Menace, in fact I probably enjoyed this less. Star Wars shouldn't be boring but the first two episodes of the prequel trilogy most definitely are. Apart from marginalising Jar Jar Binks, Lucas again produced a lacklustre movie that failed to live up to the high standards of the original trilogy. It's amazing how everything came together for the original trilogy whereas this time Lucas makes one bad decision after another- probably not helped by yes men such as producer Rick McCallum. After unforgivably starting with Anakin as a child in the first prequel, Lucas then fails to pick an actor without the necessary gravitas or spark to breathe life into the character, instead we get Hayden Christenen, just as wooden and charmless as Jake Lloyd. Of course the actors job isn't helped by the appalling dialogue and Lucas surpasses even himself in writing some of the most vomit inducing lines ever to be inflicted on an audience. The romance between Anakin and Padme suffers the worst, with some truly cringe worthy scenes that are painful to watch. A far cry from the Han and Leia relationship which was a million miles away from the forced and charmless union of Ankin and Padme. One of the main reasons I looked forward to the prequels was the chance to see the hinted at Clone Wars. After being denied that in the first movie the audience is again left to rue a missed opportunity. Instead the film takes forever to set up the Clone Wars with Obi Wan Kenobi going on some dull mission which makes no sense to most viewers, whilst there's a lot of politicians on Coruscant arguing about whether they should or shouldn't have an army. To add insult to injury we find that when the Clonetroopers do finally appear their CGI'd rather than the good old fashioned real living breathing Stormtroopers of old. The effects on a whole seem to be worse than that of The Phantom Menace. There's a lot of shoddy effects,with the end battle feeling like a computer game. Christopher Lee pops up as Count Dooku and gives the film some much needed weight, but its a case of too little too late. The simple fact is the prequel trilogy could and should have surpassed the originals, it has a stronger story, a greater character arc, tragedy and a boot load of action, instead Lucas has frittered it away. The man who's genius bore the story of Star Wars makes a real mess at creating the fall of the republic and the rise of the empire. If he had worked with a good screen writer, got the script polished and used different directors like he had before I'm in no doubt the Prequels would have been a triumph.

"This movie was pretty good except for a few details, which I shall list: 1)The fact that Lucas wrote this script is horrifying. What is even more mind boggling is that he wrote all of the Original Star Wars scripts, which were really good. Something went wrong. 2) Hayden Christiansen ruined the movie for me, him and the disgusting dialogue. I thought his character was FAR too whiny. His acting also needs some work to say the least. And finally 3) The special effects controlled the movie and overshadowed the story line. George Lucas needs to take a lesson from Peter Jackson on how to not let CGI control your film. I hope Lucas also knows that the only reason that his new Star Wars films made any money or got any recognition, was because of the old ones. When Episode I came out, everyone went to see it because they remembered how good the old ones were. That is the same case with II and III.

"Lucas returns to the real world!  What a way to come back with possibly the second best Star Wars film of them all (after Empire). Empire's darkness returns as does the more varied pace and non formula plot. The sweeping, all conquering music score is back once more after a weakish 1st episode.  Christensen is superb as Anakin, if limited by an overall simplistic dialogue.  There's a dangerous, sinister undercurrent beneath the good looks, which makes the closing scene all the more unsettling.  We know where they're heading, but they don't.  Yet!  Portman and McGregor can't quite rise above the material, lacking the dynamism of Christensen.  Two much CGI in places, and the Coruscant scene is a little overlong and far-fetched.  But the battles are first class, particularly the closing conflict.  And Christopher Lee is supreme as Dooku.  Never has an actor belied his age (almost 80) to such an extent.  Roll on part 3, but do we have to wait three years? And George: Make a final trilogy!  You'll see it in your dreams!",0.1076140873015873,0.45456349206349217

All I can say is that the movie will draw the audience slowly into the deepening plot in the first 30 minutes, bear with it, because I suppose it has to be dramatic, and its all about the characters.

"Computer Generated Imagery (CGI to those who haven't been living under a rock) is a tool, not a means to create a film.  George Lucas needs to realize this; because not only would it give his films a more realistic quality but it would remedy many of the problems that plagued EPISODE I, and unfortunately carried on to plague the latest installment, STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES.  Don't get me wrong, I loved EPISODE II, and I think that many of the problems from EPISODE I were improved upon, however many were not.  But, I digress, let me discuss a little of the positive. First of all, the movie was much better than EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE. The story was more complex, the acting was better, the tone was darker, and as many fans requested, Jar-Jar Binks was reduced to little more than an important cameo. This you can all see for yourself when you view the film.  Let me go into more depth with the negative, which is often a little more difficult for the die-hard STAR WARS fan to pick up on at first because they are so overwhelmed at seeing a new Star Wars movie on the big screen. (I know, I too loved EPISODE I when it was first released).  The vast majority of the problems with ATTACK OF THE CLONES are the result of abusing the power to create images digitally.  For the last half hour or so of the movie you can easily forget that you are watching a live-action movie and think that you are watching WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT PART II.  There are a handful of live actors interacting with CGI characters in a CGI world, and the result is very distracting.  Christopher Lee's character, Count Dooku, riding a speeder (in front of a blue screen) looks like the Wicked Witch riding her bicycle in THE WIZARD OF OZ.  This is the first time that our little green Jedi friend Yoda is created entirely using CGI techniques, and we end up losing a substantial amount of his character.

I don't want to watch 100 computer generated guys fight another 100 computer generated guys..... when they actually got into some one-on-one lightsabre action with Dooko (or whatever his bloody name was) was much more like it...... If Lucas wants to focus on the lovey dovey bit, fine by me - BUT at least find a pair of actors who have something resembling chemistry.  I found it impossible to believe that Portman and rubbish bloke had any feeling whatsoever for each other - it was like watching droids kiss, it was so mechanical. And if this is indeed a kids film, i wonder how many 8 year-olds out there are itching for heavy discussions about inter-planetary politics.... OK, there were some very pretty CGI bits, but the minute a human actor was in the midst of it the effect was ruined - it reminded me of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, only not as funny.  We liked the Millenium Falcon because it was wobbly and the actors were actually in it, we don't want shiny silvery things that exist only on a hard-drive.

Well, I still stand by all the negative stuff I've said about Phantom Menace, but Lucas has redeemed himself.  Attack of the Clones is awesome. I won't give away anything for the sake of those who haven't seen it, but let me just say this: If you are avoiding this movie because you didn't like The Phantom Menace, go see it! Anakin is far better than he was in the last movie, what little bit there is with Jar Jar is a more restrained Gungan. And the new characters are really cool.  Count Dooku is great, and Jango Fett rules!  I was really worried about seeing Boba Fett as a young boy, worried that it might be Jake LLoyd all over again, but little Boba is really cool.

"There are two ways of looking at `Attack of the Clones'. In correlation with the Star Wars saga then it is just about passable as a film that keeps the momentum of the precedent films going. However, as a film in itself it is a lame, laughable attempt at a summer blockbuster. It fits the codes and conventions of all big-budget Hollywood movies(this is not a compliment), the majority of the budget was clearly spent on the action sequences, which to be fair, are the best in any of the Star Wars films. However, the screenplay was so terrible that it would look out of place in an American daytime soap opera. There is one crucial thing that George Lucas must realise; George,YOU CANT WRITE SCRIPTS AND YOUR EAR FOR DIALOGUE IS NON-EXISTENT!!!(There, now I'm vented). Also I have to know what Lucas was smoking when he cast Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker.I thought Jar-Jar Binks was as bad as it got in Star Wars, I was tragically wrong. In another review of this film, it said that Christensen acted as if he had just come out of Dawson's Creek. I find that statement far too complimentary (and anyway, I like Dawson's Creek!).I found his performance more immature and childish than Jake Lloyd's in The Phantom Menace, he behaved like a spoilt kid who didn't get a Playstation 2 for Christmas. It fills me with trepidation that Christensen will be reprising the role in Episode III, I don't see how he can convince when he makes the transformation from Anakin to Darth Vader.

The graphics are, of course, incredible, and the adrenaline rushes were worth the $5.75 entrance fee, and some of the scenery was fabulous, but if the movie had to stand on its own without being part of the Star Wars mania, it would be barely memorable at all.",0.1797619047619048,0.6273809523809524

Thankfully, the movie comes across finishing with flying colours.  That's not to say the movie isn't without flaws.

The plot is pure Star Wars, with no attempts to be any more or less, and no apologies.

"I'm not sure why Star Wars fans give praise to either episode I or II. I've watched IV, V, and VI a hundred times and episodes I and II do not even scratch the surface of the level of action, acting, suspense, storyline, and drama evoked by the originals.  I understand people perceive things differently, but I just wonder, what was it about the originals that Star Wars fans liked, that made them huge fans?  Is it just the fact that people carry light sabers, or that when blasters are fired they make a certain sound that is unique to Star Wars movies?  Or maybe because they were movies that used the word ""Force.""  If that's the reason, then Episode II delivers. But if you're looking for anything that resembles the level of artistry that went into the Original Trilogy than Episode II ain't it.

I am beginning to hate movies with CGI in them because thats all the creators are worried about.... look how pretty that city looks screw the small scenes. I know the big debate is star wars or Spiderman, and i have to say spiderman triumphs where star wars fails the small scenes. These are the scenes that make a movie very good or can leave a movie (like this one) seemingly flat and fake.

"In a word, crap.  This installment of the Star Wars saga was satisfying only in the fact that it couldn't have been any worse than Episode I.  With that said, it was still terrible.  The dialogue was seemingly unnatural, and every scene felt like a Herculean trial. ""Soft like you...""  I can't imagine that any budding young jedi feeling The Force coursing through his veins could resist Natalie Portman.  However, did we all forget the ludicrous age discrepancy that existed between our young love birds.  As Anakin has obviously aged his appropriate ten years, our dear Amidala seems to be right where we left her.  This has one positive attached to it, and that is the realization that if Portman's character had actually appeared to age ten years, then the filmmakers would not have been able to pull off the sexy action vixen role that she fell into once the fighting began.  How amazing is it that she goes from Senator Amidala wear to Pop Star bimbo?  I can appreciate it for what it is, but certainly a distraction.  Was it an attempt to give a basis for the hutzpah of Princess Leia?  I hope so, although it was poorly done. I greatly enjoyed watching Yoda kick butt.  It certainly was an unnecessary scene in the movie, but by far the most entertaining.

Ewan McGregor delivers a top notch performance as well, and the exchanges between the two are witty and quite funny. This is the prequel that we all know George Lukas could make... a movie on par with the first three movies.

I was completely turned off by the fact that the entire movie was shot on a sound stage.  Every scene was ruined for me by the insane amounts of computer graphics.  The real achievement in this movie was the graphics and special effects.  The tech guys that worked on this stuff should be the ones getting to appear on Jay Leno and the late night talk shows because im sure they put in far more work than anyone else did.  I work on movies myself and have done some basic 1-2 minute light saber fight sequences.  This alone would take around 40 hours to edit.  I can't imagine the frustration and time it would take to do all of the computer generated backgrounds to get the to line up on the blue alpha mats to match the pace at which the actors were moving.  It was as if George Lucas found that he could get more reliable actors if they were churned out by 80 computer techs working in a little room who will receive little recognition for the movie at all.  This however may have been true going by the very, cough cough, talented acting ability of Hayden Christensen.  I mean what a lucky guy he is, here is a guy who isn't that great of an actor and he gets put in a Star Wars movie.  Something many of us have dreamed about our entire lives.

Hayden Christianson is an unknown, and judging by his acting in this, he will only be known as Darth Vader in his acting career. Natalie Portman wasn't much better as Padme. I guess George Lucas is to blame. If it were up him, I think he would rather have the next one with no actual humans acting. Ewan Mcgregror does a good job as Obi-Wan. Samuel L. Jackson has a much bigger role in this than he did just stroking his chin in The Phantom Menace, but once again, he is doing Lucas lines.

He made Anakin Skywalker boring and unmemorable, which is a shame, since his is the most important role in the six movie story arc.

"I grew on Star Wars, like many other denizens of the galaxy. The original film went out when I was 7, and is of course a masterpiece; The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi made their impact on my young mind later on, and were worthy sequels. They were fun to watch, had a compelling plot, interesting twists, great action, cool special effects, and you could identify with the good characters and hate the bad guys. Return of the Jedi was a bit cheesy - a kind of Soap Opera meets the Muppet Show - but all in all, things made sense.

It started pretty good, with the explosion of Senator Amidala's Ship, and the chase through Coruscant, but I felt that the love story was too cheesy, and the scenes were copied from the original trilogy.

But there are some good points: The clone troops being ready for deployment was magnificent cgi, and the fact that Mace Windu lopped off the rather wooden Temuera Morrison's (Jango Fett) head, and when Yoda has finally been turned to cgi instead of the hardly moveable puppet. In total: a cheesy retread.",0.15828924162257496,0.6001102292768958

"I would like to introduce Attack of the Clones. The story is a fictional movie. The story is setted 10years after ""The Phantom Menace"", and the main characters are Anikin Skywalker (who has become a Hedi), Obi-wan Kenobi, Padme Amidala(as a senator), and Count Dooku. The story starts when Count Dooku tries to kill Padme with his subordinate, and Anikin and Obi-wan rescues her. Meanwhile the the two Hedi's find out that Dooku was trying to start an attack against the Republic. How ever the Jedi's don't have enough power to fight against his droid army, so they decide to use the clone warriors. The story leads to a final battle between the droids and the clones. For a good point of the movie the story is very action-packed exciting film , the actors have done great work, and the CG's are great.Also you can see how Anikin and Padame fall in love, so it can be a touching movie. However for a bad point, the story may be confusing for people who have never seen the STAR WARS, and there are many violence scenes through the film.",0.18333333333333335,0.5428571428571429

"When you read the other reviewers of AOTC saying that George Lucas has redeemed himself after the much slated Phantom Menace, they are absolutely right. I was never one to negatovely criticise Episode 1 but I have to admit that it had lacked the essential Star Wars feel of the later episodes. This, I thought was down to the fact that I have aged 25 years since the original Star Wars and even though I attempted to view it with some of that childhood wonder, I felt perhaps that something was lacking. Any preconcpetions I may have had prior to seeing AOTC quickly disppeared though and I add my vote to the many who say that George Lucas has definitely returned to form. Attack of the Clones is, quite simply, stunning. Mainly due to the incredible effects but also due to the fact that Lucas seems to have returned to his grass roots. Perhaps, he tried too hard with Phantom, attempting to create something that would satisfy the fans' 25 year old hunger. An impossible task but here, he has settled back down into what he does best: simple storytelling. For a start, AOTC ""feels"" like proper Star Wars. In episodes 4,5 and 6, there were a number of story threads throughout each film which met to a conclusion at the end. Phantom Menace didn't seem to pull this off and followed the same characters from the film's start to its finish. In AOTC, there a number of different stories going on: Obi Wan's quest for the truth behind Senator Amidala's attempted assassination, the conspiracies happening behind the scenes in the Galactic Republic, the love story between Anakin and Padme, and Anakin's struggle with his own feelings and his role as a Jedi. This made it a much easier film to digest as each story was broken down into small pieces and alternated throughout before meeting for the conclusion. Hayden Christensen did a surprisingly good job of the maturing Anakin and although it took him a good while to achieve empathy to his character, once comfortable with his his role one could really get into the head of soon-to-be Darth Vadar. His feelings for his mother, he's uncontrollable love for Padme and his rebelliousness in the Jedi Order.  One of the most frightening scenes had him slaughtering Sandpeople, his rage uncontrolled and vicious. If Lucas maintains the passion of this character then we are in for one hell of an Episode 3 as we find out his fate. Ewen McGregor seems completely comfortable with his role as Obi Wan and looks and acts more like Alec Guinness with each passing scene. I also loved the many references to the later films, especially meeting a young Owen Lars and his girlfriend Beru. What a joy to see Luke Skywalker's future home, with Anakin sat in the refectory where we met a disillusioned Luke many years ago! And what about the young Boba Fett? Now we finally find out why he hates the Jedi so much. The young lad who plays him carries off the look of revenge so well as he realises his life-long vendetta. Watch out too towards the end of the film, a hologram of the Separatists' new weapon off-camera ... the Death Star. And did you ever want to see what Yoda really could do? Oh my god! His fight scene with Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) was a genius piece of work. The audience roared with laughter too when after putting his light sabre away, he hobbled away as normal on his walking stick! The effects are quite simply stunning. Lucas, comfortable with his art has created a universe of unparalelled beauty. We get to see more of Coruscant (watch out for the deliberate reference to Blade Runner), Naboo, Tattooine and new worlds such as Kamino and Geonosis. One of the most stunning scenes is the quite simply amazing chase sequence through the asteroids of Geonosis. Remember how impressed you were with Han Solo guiding the Millennium Falcon through asteroids after its flight from Hoth? You ain't seen nothing yet! And I was overjoyed to see one of my favourite Star Wars vehicles, The Slave I, doing its stuff. The final battle sequence too, with a million Clone Troopers fighting battle droids is perhaps one of the greatest sequences ever filmed. Attack of the Clones from my perspective as a Star Wars fan, more than excceeded my expectations and I know that I need to see it at least twice more. This is REAL Star Wars, overdosed on steriods and the best two and half hours I have spent this year. If you're a fellow fan, you'll love it and I would even say that to those who claim Empire is the best of the lot ... there's a new guy in town. Keep up the good work George and bring us an Episode 3 that you have set up so well with this installment. 10/10",0.20653537930323643,0.5012677798392082
"This was much better than Episode I.  Jar Jar lives but with only a bit part.  The jokes are corny but that is OK too.

The story was better, the film was set at a faster pace and the action was spectacular. A visual masterpiece. It is indeed, as Mr. Lucas said, a darker movie than the last. But it is to be expected in the grand scheme of the Star Wars story. The first battle of the Clone Wars between the Jedi and the Republic is akin Gladiator meets..well...meets Star Wars!

"Attack of the Clones is a little better than The Phantom Menace, but still does not even come close to the original trilogy.  Even Return of the Jedi was better overall.  I've been a huge fan of the originals for years.  I was definitely a Star Wars fanboy up until the release of the disappointing Episode I.  My expectations had been set so high and I just felt so let down.  The initial reviews of Episode II gave me a little bit of hope, but when the majors gave it mixed reviews I went into it with lower expectations.  And I still feel disappointed with this one.  Don't listen to the fanboys who like to flame the negative reviews.  This film deserves every one of them.  It's not a bad film at all but it's nothing great. The acting is mostly stale and the dialog is mostly weak.  The effects are fantastic but they seem overused.  This is most definitely an animated film starring humans.  *POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD* - - The last hour of the film is full of waaay to many different droids and forms of technology that does nothing but put the older sequel trilogy to shame as far as effects go. Most people agree that Yoda's role in the end is the best part of the film. But I think the Yoda character was dumbed down in Attack of the Clones compared to what we see of him in the original trilogy.  And not even the end of the film redeems his role in my opinion.  Plus, that particular scene is just too short.  My main gripe with this film is that it doesn't explain much of anything!  It does very little to move the story along.  Episode III has A LOT to explain...  There are things I enjoyed about this one.  I actually liked the humor with R2-D2 and C-3PO. I really enjoyed the end of the tatooine scene with Anakin.  It was very powerful.  I have yet to see this film digitally projected, but that won't change anything I've said about it.  I saw it on film.  The film was a little bit dark, but it still looked like film to me.  I look forward to the next episode and hope that George Lucas truly redeems himself.",0.1225029550827423,0.4963002364066193

Sorry to say, but times have changed since then.  George Lucas isn't an idiot...he knows exactly what he's doing, and he's making movies for today's generation.

"3D animation doesn't do it for me any more, and that is all Episode II was, visually beautiful, but what about the story? The movie was 1 hour longer than what it should of been. I think it comes down to bad directing, George Lucas should stick to writing the story and directing ILM, but he should let someone else direct, like he did in his previous movies. He is not timing his scenes properly, they ar way too long, he is definitely not directing well his actors, but I guess that it's not easy acting in front of a blue screen. What happened to the magic, where are the interesting characters, the great dialogs. The characters are so dull, not even Samuel L.Jackson could put energy to his character.

"The movie itself was very good; the special effects were pretty seamless; it had the look and feel of all the other Star Wars movies.

The saving grace I was looking for, the lightsaber battle, was not at tall what I hoped, as Christopher Lee, Count Dooku, is not Ray Park.

"As much as I defended Episode I, allot of elements of that film let me down. Episode II was fantastic. George Lucas realized with Episode I that he's no screenwriter, so he brought help and it worked out for the best. This film has some incredible action sequences, the FX are incredible. Each film makes me respect ILM a bit more. But what really made the film shine for me was the drama. I usually don't like love stories, especially ones involving teenagers (Titanic), but I have to say that I was impressed with this. Natalie Portman is certainly not an Oscar winner, but she has improved 10 fold since Phantom Menace. Hayden is amazing, he'll garner an Oscar in the next 5 years for sure. The jokes were mature and reminded me of Han Solo's brand of humor. (""Oh not good!""), even Jar Jar was great in this film. The film has that sense of adventure that I loved in Empire (Episode 5 in the series). The characters are rich and three-dimensional like the OT characters, well except for some of the politicians, but I believe that is by design. I've always loved the Jedi, they are my personal heroes in the SW Universe, and it was nice to really see them in action and in practice. We really got a glimpse of what life is like in the SW universe. None of the other films ever did that.

The digital effects were stunning, and absolutely necessary for a scene like this - the number of speeders, buildings, and people in the scene couldn't have been achieved without CGI.

If anything it is the non-humans that did the best acting - *SPOILER* I did enjoy the interaction between C3P0 and R2D2 near the end of movie, and Yoda's (again not a human) fight and ""use of the force"" with a light sabre was also entertaining, the films only redeeming features.",0.08291666666666667,0.4725

"If you are a Star Wars fan (like me), you will love this movie. If you aren't you will love it anyway, but on a different level. George Lucas has given just about everyone a light-sabre, and there are some terrific battles, far better then anything in the other Star Wars movies. You see an entire army of Jedis, running forward and smashing aside laser blasts with their light sabres, and then crashing into an army of droids, which is truly satisfying, and the young Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan fighting back to back, which is a bit ironic really, considering what will happen in the later movies. Anyway, the battles are brilliant, and Yoda gives everyone a big surprise by turning up and showing us all just why he is the Jedi master. Unfortunately, the acting was pretty rubbish: Natalie Portman, who plays Amidala was completely flat, and Anakin Skywalker just couldn't pull off the bits when he wasn't angry. Samuel L Jackson was a bit of a disappointment too; he is an excellent actor, but was held back by the script. However, Ewan Mcgregor was excellent as Obi-Wan, and acted the part really well. No worries though, as the acting was never Star Wars' strong point, and the battles truly make up for it. There were also lots of references to the later movies: Anakin has his arm chopped off, we are shown how the Bounty Hunter Boba Fett came to be, and there is a brilliant line, when Obi-Wan says to Anakin, ""I have a feeling you will be the death of me."" So anyway, if you have not seen this movie, go and see it, as it is pretty damn good. Well done George Lucas, I can't wait for the next one!",0.1966666666666667,0.5330952380952382
"To quote one of my favorite video game squirrels: ""Oh my giddy aunt...."" In my opinion, Episode II had it a little easier than Episode I did. Wheras Episode I was having to live up to the untouchable classic 3, Episode II merely had to rise above the fetid steaming pile that was Episode I.  But by no means is this an inferior movie.  EVERY SINGLE ASPECT is bettered by Episode II.  Acting, Special Effects, Plot....the list is long.  But one of the biggest differences in this movie (in my opinion) is that this movie seems a little more...""human"" if you will.  No stiff acting, or impassive emotions- this is a movie ABOUT emotions.  The classic Star Wars humor also makes a much deserved inclusion as well.  George Lucas has been forgiven. Also, on a side note:  Rumor has it that Samuel L Jackson has BMF engraved on his lightsaber.  After seeing this movie, I think most will agree with me when I say: Yoda should have the BMF engraved on his lightsaber.  Never before have I witnessed a scene in a movie with a bigger mix of emotions- fond nostalgia, absurd hilarity, and complete reverence for the arse-kicking skills of Master Yoda.

That Yoda was finally given a chance to show off his skills, that the C.G.I. would be incredible, and the story had a main focus on the relationship between Anakin and Padme.

I was completely and totally disgusted with this movie.  I can say I actually enjoyed Episode 1 more, simply for the fight scene with Darth Maul.  I will admit, C-3PO was very funny, and Count Dooku was a very good villain, but I simply cannot endorse a movie, where I feel absolutely nothing for any of the characters.

I am a huge Star Wars fan, and this movie has the caliber of greatness that Star Wars movies deserve.  This movie, in my opinion, is not only the best Star Wars movie ever, but I truly believe that it is the best movie ever made.

"Before watching this movie at the theatres, i had expected it to be a moderately gud movie.  At first sight the 'cover art' remained illustrative to keep consistent with the previous movies, which i thought was best despite the age we are in with modern photography. The film started out well, but i began to have doubts as the movie progressed for numerous reasons.  I thought the acting of Anakin Skywalker by Hayden Christensen was poor, and the performace of Obi-Wan Kenobi by Ewan McGregor wasnt as consistent as it was in the Phantom Menace.  Especially in the emotional scenes, Anakins acting suffers a great deal due to lack of facial expressions and carisma.  Even when his mum dies, you can tell the fake mourning blatently. The love scenes between Anakin and Padme didnt contain any depth, again due to Anakins poor acting (Natalie Portman as Padme was passable, but again not as gud as in Phantom menace).  Obi-Wan was a much stronger character in the phantom menace, and he looses much of his acting quality due to keeping a still face for most of the movie.  I thought the young Anakin in the phantom menace was a much better actor than the older one in Attack of the clones because of convincing acting.  I thought another downfall of the movie was the dialogue, and corny jokes.  A better dialogue delivery i think was in the older versions of star wars. The soundtrack however was good, as it captured the essence of the movie which was based on love more than anything else. One thing i didnt like in the phantom menace, was the 'over-doing' of special effects, which i think was solved in this episode.  it was moderate and kept realistic, although the jedi masters gliding in the air was abit daft.  Overall a good movie, but not as gud as the phantom menace.",0.15035991140642302,0.4208471760797342
"Star Wars. The name is practically a mandatory addition to modern man's vocabulary. After the huge breakthroughs the original Trilogy made in sci-fi movies, fans have been screaming for more. It wasn't until Episode I came out that their appetite has been whetted. And while it was a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga, there were a lot of people who were disgruntled with the less-than-great acting on the part of Anakin, and the ok-at-first-but-quickly-becoming-annoying Jar Jar Binks. It undeniably didn't do for movies today what the original Star Wars did back in 1977. Personally, however, I enjoyed the movie and wasn't too disappointed. Well, Episode II has come out and it is clear to me that George Lucas has learned from some of his mistakes in Phantom Menace and turned out an amazing and very entertaining movie that should please both die-hard Star Wars fans and the casual movie-goer. While it certainly has a different feel than did the originals, since hardly a frame goes by that isn't 95% computer generated, it is still Star Wars and a movie that is not to be missed.",0.15033068783068787,0.5957275132275133

It was a milestone something like the first man on the moon. How could you not fell in love with a movie like this when you`re about 12 years old ? But now back to the point and Episode 2. I remember all those critics who tell you it consists of a poor story, bad or average actors at best and ok at least some good special effects. Hey guys, be honest, the isn`t much worse than TITANIC who`s still the top movie to be beaten. Hayden and Natalie are as good actors as Leo and Kate who are often called to be great actors !? And has anyone seen some kinda special effects anywhere else ? Especially this Episode offers you a lot. Besides a romance and lovestory it`ll give you more answers and how young Skywalker turn into Darth Vader. You`ll see some lightsaber duels that remind me of the 3 Musketeers. A chase through the skyscrapers of Coruscant. and Samuel L.

The plot and trying to figure out who is who is so confusing it's ridiculous- the empire, the republic, the senate, the trade federation, the commerce guild, the separatists, the clones, the drones, the schmones. In the first trilogy, there was just the empire and the rebellion- simple and clear cut. Lucas does a poor job of developing the main characters- you have no vested emotional interest in Amidala or Anakin. Why should we care about them? Why is the title Attack of the Clones? Weren't the clones fighting with the Jedi and for the good guys? Is Senator Palpatine Darth Sidious? Is he the Emperor?Who is Chancellor Valorem and what do these guys have to do with anything? Which side is fighting for and with whom? Plus, Lucas assumes that every creature in the universe has a humanoid form with a head, torso, two arms and two legs. There is no scientific basis to support or assume that. Jar Jar Binks makes me want to retch. Does the republic become the empire? What about the separatists and the trade federation?

"They say that familiarity breeds contempt, well it certainly seems to cultivate arrogance, in between the thunderous fun i have experienced with the two latest editions to the Star Wars saga, (yes both of them),i've become aware of a truly cynical backlash against these films, a form of dyed in the wool fan, or casual viewer of the original trilogy, with a limited ,narrow view of exactly what constitutes a star wars film. Of course everyone is entitled to an opinion on any given subject, but the scorn being poured upon these films now seems a little disproportionate when one considers the neverending pants that flaunts itself each year, in the summer season. The most common complaint, the script. Re-watch the original trilogy, with your back to the screen, listen to the dialogue, not how it is read, but the actual words, then likewise for the new films, i think you will find an even match. The manner in which dialogue is performed is different in TPM,AOTC, because the characters are more formal, they would not talk in the colloquial fashion that the characters of Luke or Han did, although to be fair Lucas has tried to insert the odd glib line in AOTC. Watto is one of the few characters in the recent films who does talk in such a manner, cynical, sarcastic, and i do recall at the time of TPM release he was wideley recognised as the most ""star wars"" ,like character. The plot is too complex, well yes, there is more plot to these episodes , than simply goodies v baddies, as the originals were, the first three films were off and running from Star Wars opening scroll, the villains were in place, consequently the new films have to establish the empire, they have to show Anakin and Padme falling in love, and again given the social stature, and age of these people it would ring hollow if they flirted in the knowing ,nudge-nudge manner Han and Leia did, we knew he was going to show this, and here it is and yet some of us appear incensed by it.The computer animation looks false, to be fair sometimes it does, so lets return to jerky stop motion, which ultimately also looked false, look at Robocop2, (one of the last times i can recall stop motion in a big release), it still looked unconvincing, funny the year after that was Terminator 2 ,when CGI really kicked in. Please dont get me wrong Phil Tippett is a genius. Another complaint , in AOTC the droid factory sequence does not progress the narrative, again a fair comment , and strangely enough applicable to the chasm swing in Star Wars, or the trash compacter sequence, or the speeder bike chase in Jedi, if memory serves all very popular bits, ah but you would say they were character moments,(spoiler alert) i.e a moment of insite into who the character is ,or will be, so excepting that, it was shear coincidence the image of Anakins arm pinned beneath the robotic plating, echoed what we soon find out happens to said arm, hmmm?.Natalie Portmans swift recovery, after falling from a moving spaceship, at the films climax, again a fair observation, totally unlike somebody falling from a speeder bike moving at 80mph+, eh? Lucas is just making these films to sell toys, interesting that people, whom i'm sure laid their head on a Empire Strikes Back pillow case back in the mists of the 80's, have become such staunch socialists today. Yes i agree there are flaws in the new films, but take a second, and look back clearly at the originals, the problems were there too, just not as visible to a 5-12 year old, feel the new films, dont scrutinize them, because old or new, they never stood up to that.",0.0980175421593332,0.47138872735887644

"This movie gets a lot of flack and has been called by many (including a certain man whose name rhymes with bebert) the worst movie in the Star Wars saga. I, however, would disagree whole heartedly with that accusation. I would almost put Episode II on par with Episode III for best of the prequels. It's not nearly as good as the classic originals, but it's still got enough plot and character development to keep the audience interested. It definitely did what Episode I failed to do in terms of plot and character development. First off, let me get some of the common complaints about this movie out of the way right away. A lot of people complain about the amount of romance in this movie. Yeah, yeah, I know, George Lucas is not a very good romance director, at all. But the romance that's in this film is here for a reason. George wanted to show the developing relationship between Anakin and Padme in a way that would make the events of the next film even more tragic. So, in a sense this is the most romantic of the Star Wars movies and the romance is actually more necessary here than it was in The Empire Strikes Back. I think the reason why so many fans were offended by this kind of romance is because it was something that hadn't been done in a Star Wars film before. But is that a bad thing? Is it so wrong for George Lucas to expand his universe a bit by trying new things? Not everything has to be the same as the originals. Now, all that being said, the romance aspect wasn't perfect. A few moments are almost cringe-worthy, but it also had some moments that were really affective and I really did feel attached to these two people by the time they get married at the end of the film. The next thing that people complain about is Hayden Christianson's acting. People, it's a Star Wars movie. The last thing I'm looking at is the acting when I watch these movies. Remember how horrible and whiny Mark Hammill was in the original (""But I wanted to go to Tosche Station to pick up some power converters! Waaaaaah!"") Yeah, I bet you forgot about that because you paying attention to the story and characters too much to notice. Sure there are better choices to play Anakin and I'm not saying that Hayden is the best choice for Anakin, but he's certainly not the worst. In reality, no one's a good actor in Star Wars. Even good actors aren't good actors in Star Wars. In fact Hayden's a decent actor in most of his other work, it's just that this is Star Wars and the focus is not on the acting. Anyways, with those things out of the way, I will say that Episode II's plot isn't perfect. Sometimes it just gets a bit too, well, boring. But the fact remains that George really stepped up the character development on this one just like he did in Episode V and it really shows through. People and things are starting to shift in a big way here and there's enough mystery to keep audiences interested to want to see a third movie where they basically already know what's going to happen. Going back and making movies about something that already happened is a huge undertaking for anyone and I feel that story-wise this one got it right the most due to major continuity flaws in the third movie and the lack of progression in the first. There's also enough eye candy here to keep the casual film-goer interested, such as a lightsaber battle with Yoda and an epic clone war battle at the end of the movie. When Obi-Wan briefly mentioned the clone wars at the beginning of Episode IV no one imagined it was going to be this cool. Seeing that battle is reason alone to see this movie. Ultimately though, Episode II is a Star Wars movie for Star Wars fans and I think that's why a lot of casual viewers couldn't appreciate it. It's not perfect, but it's far from being bad.",0.08082286742728817,0.48610884373079494

Not bad for a character who used to be a glorified sock puppet with someone's hand crammed in his rear.  Luckily, the entire movie didn't suck to say the least, and George Lucas, in my opinion, has made up for the travesty that was ""The Phantom Menace"" from which the only good things we got were Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan and Natalie Portman as Queen...uh, no--Senator...um...oh, you know, that absolutely hot girl who got her form-fitting white outfit all torn up at the end of Episode II.

"I have been hearing people complaining about how uninspired this film is emotionally. I believe this is for good reason. We have seen how ships in Phantom Menace had beautiful lines and style, but as we move through time towards A New Hope it becomes utilitarian and functional. This has been explained as a move from an age of the Republic's beauty and art into an age of Trade Federation cold capitalism and ultimately into an age of Imperial totalitarianism. I believe a similar thing is happening with personality styles. We have a republic that is sick and dying and being torn apart, and much of it is based on the fact that the politicians are mostly bureaucrats and passionless, and that a Jedi's guiding principle is restraining emotions. Since these are the people who are getting the wool pulled over their eyes by charismatic separatists like Dooku and Sidious, you can see why they are destined to fail. Like many civilizations in decline, they are apathetic and listless, and they are bound to be boring in comparison to their descendants Han Solo, Leia, Luke Skywalker in the coming rebellion who have a reason to light a fire in their eyes and hearts. They are like the revolutionaries that fought for freedom in America. They are the Jeffersons and Reveres of Star Wars. Comparing a Naboo Senator and a pack of cool headed Jedis to the gang on the Millenium Falcon is unreasonable. It is like comparing George W. Bush to George Washington. It all depends on whether you are trying to defend freedom from a position of power, or fighting for it from a far off empire's ""Most Wanted"" list. Remember, England promised the death penalty for anyone who signed the Declaration of Independence. America is an old republic now, I see no passion in leadership here either. To sum it up. If Han, Leia, and Luke were running the Republic, I doubt they would have been all that interesting either. Eddie Keever",0.09628942486085343,0.6672232529375387

On first viewing I found AOC to be visually overwhelming and complex to the point of incoherence.  I've seen it a few more times since and I keep enjoying it more.  Lucas has not succeeded at recreating the pristine splendor of what is now called ""Episode I""; the beauty and simplicity of that movie has been supplanted by overly-complex yet banal plotting, and and stupifyingly ornate costumes, creatures and special effects.  I find it irritating that George Lucas (or his creative droids) keep needing to perform damage control in order to maintain that the entire series was written before Episode IV was produced. This is so blatantly a fiction-- wish George would just own up to it. Maybe he had a basic plot in mind, but the continuity problems are just so manifest that it is impossible that he had it completed back then.

Kenobi's half of the story came off much better, since McGregor was actually instilling some fun qualities into his character. Perhaps the biggest flaw the film has is having characters with whom the audience may invest emotion in.

"One can expect the very best in special effects when it comes to a George Lucas.  That being said, I cannot forgive him for the atrocity of some dialogue.  There are points where it is almost embarrassing.  Hayden is a good-looking kid, but not a good actor.  He's better than Jake (Epi I), but not good.  The movie really lacked the biting one-liners or give-and-take that was so well crafted in the original series.  But since I am a hard-core fan, I can look past the trifles of acting and enjoy the spectacle.  (And for those who disliked Jar Jar so much, this movie can give you a justification for it, with a snicker and grin.)  Samuel L. is just too cool as a Jedi, Yoda looks much more like the original that many of use grew up with, and Natalie is a pleasure to watch.  The new worlds and new critters were interesting.  I agree that the linear battle sequence (as opposed to Epi I's three fights at once) was much better.  There were tense moments, and moments to cheer.  The action towards the end will tend to make up for the shortcomings in the beginning.  In fact, it almost felt like Lucas was filming a war movie.  So George, I guess you are forgiven after all.  7 out of 10.",0.21120621802439982,0.45775088547815823
"First, Lucas had nothing to prove with this film.  Episode I was as fine as any of the original three and better in some ways.  Second, he owes us (The viewers) nothing.  He is doing this for our entertainment not to line his pocket books.  The man has been a billionaire for years.  Now for all of you who claim to be Star Wars ""fans"" but are disappointed by this film all I can say is that I'm disgusted by you.  Episode II is not disappointing at all. The dialogue is not trite, contrived, tired and predictable, or any other words you don't know the meaning to but saw other people using them so you decided to use them yourselves.  It lives up to the original three very nicely and tells you exactly what happened to make sweet Anakin Skywalker turn into the person we all love to hate, Darth Vader.  As for the acting. Do you remember how horrible the acting was the first time around?  Yet everyone loves those films and doesn't seem to be bothered by the fact that none of them could act.  So why the beef now?  And I don't recall Lucas ever saying that he was a first rate director.  His strong point is story telling and at that he is better than anyone, past or present.  Which brings us to plot.  The plot of this film is to protect the Senator from being killed and find out who is trying to kill her.  Wow, that's so horrible.  Star Wars' plot was to try and rescue the princess and in doing so get the Death Star plans to Obi-Wan.  I can argue that that is a sub par plot.  My point is, they are both great movies with great plots and both deserve to be thought of as so.  If you don't like them you don't have to I'm not telling you to. But don't claim to be a huge Star Wars fan and then strike these two latest films off as lacking.  I can not express how happy I am with this latest installment and how I wish Episode III was coming out next week.  If you don't understand that then maybe you should go and see Spider-Man.  As for me I'm going to go see Episode II again and remember why after 25 years George Lucas is still the most sought after film maker of our generation.",0.0917948717948718,0.5700854700854701

I thought it was awsome how they introduced the Storm Troopers, we got to see Luke's aunt Beru and unlce Owen in their youth, and most importantly (I don't even know if I am worthy of saying this) we got to see Yoda fighting with a lightsaber. That was the best fight I have ever seen in my life (and im not limiting that to just Star Wars fights). Needless to say the audience sat there dumbfounded. How could that the little green guy who seemingly can barely walk, jump around doing flips and cartwheels as he attempts to defeat Count Dooku. Simply incredible. People have compared this movie to The Empire Strikes Back. I thought the only thing that AOTC lacked that would beat out ESB is it didn't have a ""Luke, I am your father"" scene. But then again, ESP had Yoda sporting his cain, while ATOC had his taking charge with his green lightsaber. Episode II lives up to its hype. I rate this movie 4.5/5 stars.",0.2938725490196078,0.6

Attack of the clones in my opinion has a lot to do with the original trilogy than episode 1 because we meet Luke's aunt and uncle, the clone troopers will eventually become storm troopers and WE FINALLY SEE THE ORIGINS OF THE DEATH STAR...which for me was a spine tingling moment.... the death star will probably play a role in episode 3.

Coming out of the theatre after this film I felt I needed to sit down and get a bit of fresh air to clear my head! There's just so much action and so many visual effects (especially in the second half) it was almost impossible to take it all in - definitely a must-see-twice movie. The strongest aspect of the film for me is the plot which starts with a bang when Padme's ship is destroyed and never lets up. Some say the first half is boring but I disagree; it sets up the characters and plot very well - if the whole film was like the second half I think I would have fainted trying to keep up!,-0.03827160493827159,0.37808641975308643
"Star Wars has been many things over the past 25 years: action, romance, mystery, and even hoakey. But until now it has never been story-dense. Say what you will about the ridiculousness of the title, Attack of the Clones is nothing short of awesome. Even if you have never seen a Star Wars film in your life (and I would sincerely find that hard to believe) you owe it to yourself to see this movie. So you didn't see Phantom Menace. So what? It wasn't a complete masterpiece (the podrace and the last thirty minutes do a lot to save it, though). This is. From the opening moments on the landing platform to the last 45 minutes (which is truly one of the most intense things ever put to the screen), you are barely given a chance to breathe, much less try to make sense of the actual story. I've seen it twice before opening weekend is over and I'm still going to have to see it at least twice more, not to mention buying it on DVD the day it comes out, before I'll be sure that I know everything that was going on in the movie. Also, as though you need another reason to see the movie: Yoda has himself a little action scene that y'all might enjoy (Yoda with a lightsaber--Hell Yea!!!). Bottom line, go see it. Don't ask questions, just go see it.",0.17311507936507936,0.399074074074074
"I won't give any plot spoilers here, but just my general impressions after seeing the film at 12:01 last night.  High points were definately the music (although I didn't recall any new themes being introduced, rather variations on old), the costuming (Natalie looks spectacular in everything), the creatures (although one needed to be attacked with some lemon and drawn butter rather than a blaster *grin*), and the ships (the first big one being very reminiscent of the prop plane in Casablanca).  The droids were very entertaining, and Yoda kicked his little green butt into overdrive for some seriously Jackie Chan-type action! Who knew?  However, while overall the plot and storyline started coming together, I felt that similar to Episode I the dialogue and acting really have taken a backseat to the special effects. While I can't deny that they are indeed beautiful, I have two specific issues with them.  First that they are indeed so perfect as to not have the somewhat gritty reality quality that the first films had.  They feel more like a video game or a cartoon at times than a film.  Secondly, that there are so many separate elements included on the screen in some scenes that it becomes overwhelming and scatters the focus of the scene itself.  Also, in re-watching the first films, I was struck at how much edgier both the dialogue and the characters were then.  While many of us could recite and quote the great lines from the first three films, the lines from Episodes I and II seem to be forced and in some cases are simply recycled poorly. Amidala could have been edgier with better lines, and a more intense, less ""American Pie"" teenage boy to play against.  The audience laughed in places that it obviously wasn't intended, and it was unfortunately due to the hormonal rather than anguished/love-struck performance that should have been.  Ewan was good, but again needed to be more edgy and less wishy-washy....the interaction between Obi-Wan and Anakin fell flat for me, particularly since it was supposed to be taking place after they'd been together for 10 years.  10 years training as a Jedi would certainly have ingrained far more maturity and tact in Anakin even if he would have still had the ego of a 20 year old.  They would have been more like partners of mutual respect, rather than the relationship seen.....one that could have been undermined in a far more effective subtle fashion than occurred.  It was actually this relationship that was the key to the entire plot of this film.....Anakin's desire for respect and praise of his abilities, to be thought of as an equal while being egged on by the Senator who played to his ego.  Unfortunately, it simply didn't succeed.  I know some will think it blasphemous to say so, but it seems to me that while George Lucas has continued to develop his skills as a director of special effects, his skills of directing actors and his writing seem to have atrophied a bit over the years.  I was reminded of the adage that simply because you *can* do something (i.e. with technology) doesn't mean that you *should*.  Less is more, and using effects as enhancement and backdrop rather than making them the overwhelming star would have instead made this a film at least equal to the original three.  I feel that Lucas is truly visionary, has blazed the trail for the present movie industry, and will bring them finally into the age of digital projection that has so long been overdue.  However, in regards to this film, I think that perhaps to have done this as a collaborative effort with another strong director (such as the ""Raiders"" series with Spielberg) would have achieved a far more effective end result.",0.16521242323567897,0.47144681868519084
"The acting was wooden, the plot rambled, and the special effects simply distracting. Natalie Portman can act -- her performance in The Professional was Oscar caliber. But under Lucas she is mechanical. The future Darth Vader suddenly goes to look for his mother in the middle of the film -- a segment that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Apparently he is motivated by a dream. But he hasn't bothered to look her up in years.  Must be the Dark Force clouding his vision.

On top of this, the visuals in the film are simply unparalleled.  While Phantom Menace (which still is not a Star Wars movie in my book) had good stuff, the art was not so effectively implemented with the new visual technology as in this film.

First of all the dialog is horrible, the love story should have been a big part of the movie, but it is not convincing at all.  The movie is full of poorly constructed logic.  For example, why the hell the bounty hunter trying to use some poison bugs to kill the senator, when he can actually put some bugs into her room without any trouble, why not just shoot her right there.  Also the special effect didn't get very good untill the second half,  the sky chase part of the movie is not original, merely a shamelessly copy of Fifth Element which was made 6 years earlier, and still looked a lot better than this movie.  The only good thing I can say about this movie is the special effect at the end, yes it is very good.  But for some reason, I am not that impressed.  I think I expected Star War to be this good.

The movie starts out pretty good, with the attempted assassination of Senator Amidala (the former Queen). Unfortunately the rest of the first half of the movie tends to fall into cliche's. It looks like Mr. Lucas just grabbed all the classic scenes from love stories, and put them in a row. It's just an overkill. Come on, nobody is waiting to hear Amidala say 'Every minute I spend without you, a piece of me is dying.' Besides that the focus is drawn away from the real story. And this is what the movie is about, and what makes up for the lousy first half. With the precognition of Episode I, and the other Star Wars movies, one can see the underlying plot develop. Hints to future events are hidden everywhere.

"George Lucas had devoted a large chunk of his life to the biggest ever family epic ever filmed. In turn, he has made enough money to live without ever having to really THINK about money. But this Episode of the Star Wars saga has a different tone to it then all the others. In the original trilogy, Lucas handed over the directorial reigns because of the difficulty he didnt not wish to repeat when Star Wars was made. With this prequel trilogy, the first film was seen as part galant attempt to prepare the balances for the characters to come but as some critics would easily let you know, to 'cash in' on the box office star wars madness. But Attack Of The Clones, despite the slightly silly nature of the title, delivers in less the money making sense, and more in the character driven sense. Each character in this movie has two sides. Padme Amidala is both leader and fragile lady, Anakin is both destined for greatness and confusion and obviously Palpatine is not all he seems. It was a shame the character of Count Dooku did not appear in the first film to add some consistency, but never the less, Lee is at his best, firmly set in stone once again. As an admirer of the works of Alec Guiness, I incredibly enjoyed Ewan McGregor portrayal of the young mentor of Anakin. With this saga, we watch Obi-Wan turn from learner, to young (and weakened) teacher, to hero, to wise old sage and then immortal (of sorts). It is easy to see how Lucas will turn Obi Wan in too the great character portrayed by Guiness in Episode IV. With Luke, he tries not to make the same mistakes twice. Its a shame the third movie will have to cover so much ground (the Jedi Purge, Windu's death, the hiding of the twins) and mostly likely have a time jump in the middle. And although Lucas has already filmed the ending of this prequel series in Tunisia, one can only hope that this set of films can stand by themselves, not as a prologue to the events of Luke's life, but as a moral message, which shows a somewhat innocent fall into corruption, so that his son can redeem him.

"The entire Star Wars saga is a fantastical and brilliantly imaginative concept, but, ironically, in the hands of its creator, the story is done a great injustice.  Unlike Episodes IV,V and VI, which benefited from both simplicity (Lucas couldn't go overboard in A New Hope) and outside influence (different directors amongst other input in V & VI), Episode II is beleaguered by Lucas's autocratic control of his creation. Plainly, Lucas is a bad storyteller. In Episode II, all the elements that made the first three films classics are there: the strong, and interconnecting themes of good and evil, the inventiveness  and most definitely the effects.  However, the merits of these elements are largely lost in Lucas's inability to use the power of images and the techniques of film to tell his tale.  He insults the audience by relying on unnecessary exposition, worsened by elementary dialogue, to carry his plot points, rather than letting a telling glance or a shadowy sneer do the work for him (e.g. Ankin/Amidala scene by fire or before they enter the coliseum, etc.).  This compounded with flat direction and poor editing, create an unbalanced film lacking in emotion. Unfortunately, when you get down to brass tacks, there are some outstanding scenes and imagery in this film that if reworked could have yielded a much more effective product.  I love Star Wars, and will probably give this film more credit than it deserves, as it helps close another chapter of a story that I feel so connected with, but I can't help but think that if this weren't part of the ""Saga"" I'd be p***ed I spent my 10 bucks to go see it.",0.10407647907647907,0.5665172129457844

It shows nothing on it. It doesn't let us know what the movie is about, it doesn't let us know anything about the characters...anything. Not like the trailer of AMERICAN PIE II where you can see the whole movie in 1minute and 35 seconds. With this I mean that the movie was a total surprise for me. Not only i loved it but it was also very emotional for me...watching Amidala hugging Anakin...and the music swells, and...I think this movie was made with ""The"" Star Wars magic, unlike EPISODE I, which was quite boring and quite intensive...4 wars at the same time...give the Force a break. With Episode II, Star Wars rise again, with great classic touches from the original episodes, to great new adventures and a great script in my opinion. I can't deny however how sad it was, for me at least. I think the best performance on the movie is Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, played by Ian McDiarmid. What I liked the most about the film is the scenes, moments, places and language that made me remind of the old movies. It was the greatest Dejá vu moment i have ever had in the silver screen.

I am a huge fan of the Star Wars films in general and I will be the first person to admit that all of the movies have some cheesy dialog, but none of the dialog in the old trilogy or the other 2 films in the prequel trilogy are as awkward or boring to watch as in Attack of the Clones. The dialog in the romantic scenes between Padme and Anakin should definitely been edited by someone other then George Lucas. This movie had promise but certain scenes such as the Yoda and Dooku fight are just ridiculous. Yoda suddenly running and jumping around out of nowhere was just stupid, especially after he had to use a cane in the movie and a half before it.

Ewan McGregor was good as Obi-Wan and Samuel L. was okay, although I kept expecting him to exclaim ""But is this a righteous light-saber?"".

At first everybody seemed to wait patiently for the action to start up again, then the ""BORING""-chants started and finally a lot of the people started to leave the cinema.

Digital effect which is the driven force of the details are brighter than any recent movies, and past movies are far away to be taken into account as you can see.

"While many of us would like to forget about The Phantom Menace, there are some, such as yours truly, who feels it to be a neccesary evil, a small scene situated in a massive play.  Attack of the Clones thankfully stays away from its predecessor's sophomoric formula (namely Jar-Jar) and focuses on a more tightly knit story.  While it is in no way Citizen Kane, Attack of the Clones does harken back to the roots of the old trilogy.  Some can compare it to The Empire Strikes Back, however I am sure Episode III will be the darkest of them all.  This film does have it share of cheesy romance, poor acting and even poorer dialogue.  But just think about it.  Who sees a Star Wars film for that anyway.  Give me a cool chase, lots of blaster fire and whole lotta lightsaber dueling and you got yourself one happy camper. If Episode III plays out the way it should, when we all look back in the end people will come to realize that the prequels did their job and did it well",0.02218045112781955,0.4907685881370092
"Attack of the Clones is an excellent movie, and is far superior to Phantom Menace (which is still a good movie). It is more fun than Episode 1, has a faster pace, has a more interesting plot, and less Jar-Jar. This is a visually stunning film (it didn't hurt to see it in a digital theater). The action scenes are fantastic, and it was nice to see Mace Windu and Yoda receive more screen time; the audience cheered every time they were onscreen at the end of the movie. Hints of dark things to come kept popping up throughout the film, which added to the fun. The film has its flaws. It is a little slower at the beginning of the movie, and the dialogue IS a bit flat or corny at times, but that is something one hears in all of the Star Wars movies. I will have to watch the film again, but after the initial viewing I feel that this film ranks up there with the original trilogy, and I can't wait to see it again.",0.3117063492063491,0.5115079365079365

AOTC is terrific in that it draws up part of the story of a transformation of a good character to evil, while also telling the story of how a republic crumbles.

"The yet to come Darth Vader is growing inside Anakin Skywalker SPOILERS This one is more of the same. Of course great effects etc. But they can be seen on any screen in your neighborhood movie theatre. The only thing that is really interesting, after episode 1 we all wondered how nice little Anakin could eventually have become Darth Vader, the father of Luke Skywalker (know your history) is his character development. This Anakin is in his late puberty and  acts like all pubers do. He is an impatient ""know it all"" and thinks he is unrightfully denied the Jedi final exam (yet). Besides all that, his love for (former) queen now senator Amadilla stays unanswered, even more, after one burning kiss he is repeatedly turned down. So he gets frustrated and annoyed. So far not much more then a normal teen phase we all have gone through or will. Then Lucas introduces, out of the blue, the captured and dying mother of Anakin. In a dream it came to him and he's going to rescue her, alas with no success at all. ""I miss you so much"" he says after her death. Which is quite unlikely since he hasn't seen her for about ten years or so. But Lucas must have been in great need of an explanation why Anakin eventually turned over to the dark side and into Darth Vader, besides Anakins' teen angst. And there it is: Hatred! As we learned from earlier episodes, hate is what draws a Jedi Knight to the dark side. Mothers die and loves are turned down but it didn't turn me to the Dark side. So may be in Episode III it'll all become crystal clear. But I'm afraid George Lucas will have a hell of a job to make that final turn acceptable. And the rest of the story, well the usual stuff, political plots, traitors in high places and massive attacks near the end. Why do I still go to these Star War movies?

"unbelievable, such cynical people. i don't listen to critics, i've been to film school myself and film students are snobs, critics are just hybrid snobs. I realize it's a generalization, but it's an accurate one. just remember that those who can- do, those who can't- just gripe... Critics are often completely inept of a creative drop of blood in their body, and yet they so freely critique the creative work of others. They're failed screenplay writers in alot of cases, and failed film makers in other cases. Yet, we listen to them? why?- Would we ask a high school drop-out to take the bar exam? Think about it, was anyone honestly blown away by A Beautiful Mind? - The critics' pick for this year's best picture; a decent movie, but unoriginal and stupid. Russell Crow would have done a pretty good job- if his character had turrets, because his nervous impulses weren't indicative of schizophrenia (which was what his character really suffered from). Film is art, which infers creativity and yet one of the most creative films that we will likely see this year is slammed, why? A man with money and influence tries to do something to advance his profession into the 21st century so they're not using ancient methods of filming. His methods would allow for longer lasting and better quality film. Yet, he is condemned for this, why? Film is entertainment 1st and foremost, and George Lucas has made movie-going into an event again with the Star Wars series. Yet, he is trashed for this as well, why? Is it jealousy? Are those who ""can't do"" jealous of the one who so obviously can? Perhaps that's too simple an answer. Don't make the movie going experience into something it's not, there's no need for such pretension. No one should let critics b.s. them into believing that a grainy film which is long and boring is worth the 10 bucks over Episode 2, which is built for the soul purpose of entertaining. In the end all that critics are doing is giving opinions and opinions are subjective. I am sure many films are better examples than Star Wars of aesthetically perfect movies, but it doesn't matter because movie making is about one thing, the audience. Not the reviews. Critics are not the final word on movies as much as they might like to believe they are, the box office has proven this fact time and again. I've seen Episode 2 and it was a truly amazing experience, the electricity in the room was like a rock concert, the effects were wild and fast, the story was good and I walked out with a smile on my face and a heart beating fast.

"Like many of you who are Star Wars fans, I was eagerly anticipating Episode II and had hoped that it would be as good, if not better, than Episode I.  The trailers looked awesome and the story line sounded great. Romance, action, suspense, thrills, lightsabers, Sam Jackson kickin' major butt!  What's not to like about it.  Well, I'll tell you.  The action was plentiful, but contrived since it all looked animated.  In fact, most of the movie was animated and it really gave the film a fake look.  Even the best CGI in the world couldn't make this film look realistic.  The romance seemed kind of silly and forced.  This is a minor flaw because if those two love birds didn't get together, then the whole Star Wars thing wouldn't exist anyway.  But, maybe George should have noticed how badly Hayden handled the romantic subplot and could have found somebody better.  I will say Mr. Christensen could look pretty pissed off when he wanted to and I believed he could be the future Darth.  I guess if he had better dialogue to work with, then the romance would have clicked.  The suspense in the film diminished pretty close to the beginning of the film after I realized there really wasn't anyone I cared about in this movie.  The thrilling parts of the movie were not really thrilling because I could not believe anything that anyone did.  Why do Jedi's stop jumping high and flying in the later episodes? Oh, yeah, no CGI.  The lightsaber battles in this film were simply a disapointment.  Yeah, I know about Yoda and that was funny to watch, but much of the lightsaber battles in the film were camera closeups of the actors face's and I don't want to see actor's faces in a lightsaber battle, I want to see the fight.  Darth Maul and Obi-Wan in Ep. I had a pretty good battle with stunts and acrobatics which this movie just lacked.  Sam Jackson seemed wasted in this film as he was in Ep. I.

"The Love Story subplot is badly written, poorly acted, too long, tedious and boring.  It seems that Lucas can no longer cast, write for, or direct young actors,. The very talented Ms. Portman is only marginally effective in Clones, IMO, through no fault of her own.  There is only so much a young actor can do with such extended wooden dialogue and aimless direction. Hayden Christensen, OTH, transcends the merely mediocre material to be truly awful in his own right.  It's like the stiff child actor who played little Anakan in Phantom has grown up to be an equally untalented teen actor.  None of the strength, power, charisma, dark humor, or nacent malevolence of the future Darth Vadar come through in any way. Instead, we get shallow teen idol mouthing and grimacing his way through the part, reminicent of the days when studios used to cast teen rock stars in movies without regard for their acting ability --if any. I did not believe Mr. Christensen's Anakan for one second. Instead of Darth Vadar trapped inside a teen, I am seeing a spoiled 10 year old trapped in the body of an awkward 18 year old. Believe it or not, there are numerous young male actors who can really act & help give some life to such a flat script. Lucas either no longer knows young talent when he sees it, or does not care as long as they ""look the part.""  Mark Hamill comes across like a trained Shakespearean actor compared to Hayden Christensen. Worse, these two ""lovers"" are on screen declaiming there love (and filling in back story trivia) for extended periods of time, causing virtually everyone in the theater to start twitching and moving tiredly in their seats  -- including the young girls that such chick material must have been aimed at. Lucas has too much control of this material for his own good. Much of this tedious pap could and should have been edited out without harming the story at all.  (Remember how short and sweet the love interest was kept in the first Trilogy?  What happened to that restraint?)  Dare I say it, Lucas is starting to remind me of Kevin Costner, who can't bring himself to cut anything either after he has shot it. OTH, the action scenes, costumes, and digital sets are remarkable and well worth the price of admission, and (other than Christopher Lee's always memorable turns) are just about the only real reason to see this flick, unless you are into memorizing the latest Star Wars trivia,",0.037294217687074846,0.4701530612244898

I must admit, some elements of Episode I were a disappointment (J.Binks & A.Skywalker), but overall I did appreciate the film. I hoped and prayed that the next film would redeem some of Episode I's weaknesses and after just having viewed the film for the first time on opening day at 12:01 am, I can say to you that I can't wait to add this film to my collection so that I may watch it over and over as well. In just over 12 hours, I will be viewing this film again and I can't wait! Natalie (Amidala), a stunning beauty, and Hayden (Anakin), a gorgeous young man, were perfectly cast in their roles; they definitely fit the look needed for episodes IV, V, and VI, and their acting is wonderful. I accept the gaps in the development of their relationship as necessary in order to keep the film under 2.5 hours; besides, anyone that has ever been in love can easily fill in all the details. My favorite part of this film has got to be seeing youthful, strong, properly trained Jedis in action! I was blown away by their skill and the wonderful cinematography. Now, I wait in anticipation of the final installment of the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy...And for that I thank you, George Lucas--for making me feel 9 once again!",0.2834722222222223,0.5463888888888888
"As much as I hate to say it, this movie is terrible. Yes there are lots of whiz-bang effects, rich worlds, etc. etc. But in the beginning you must have a plot, and acting to make a movie. Towards the second half of the movie the acting improves a little, but in the first half it is very wooden. Ms. Portman in particular seems very amateurish (as a fan, it is difficult to be so candid). Her acting is much better in some of the deleted scenes, and her costumes more eye-catching.",-0.05273148148148148,0.44166666666666665
"This movie is truly a dissapointment.  Some of the worst acting I've seen in a long time.  Lucas obviously wasn't looking to see if his characters were feeling the force.  Most of the scenes in the first half of the film look like the actors are reading their lines.  The actor who plays Anakin is terrible, and Portman looks like she's saying a line for the umteenth time. The action gets going in the last 45 or so minutes, but go to the concession stand for the first half, nothing really important really happens anyway.",-0.04880952380952381,0.4119047619047619
"Watching Star Wars- Episode II: Attack of the Clones, I felt as if George Lucas had gone through every single piece of hate mail he had recieved from Phantom Menace and made every effort to satisfy his disappointed fans in the next installment of his saga. Does he succeed? Without question, yes. The most frequently mentioned disappointments of Phantom Menace are as follows: Jar Jar Binks (need I say more about him?), wooden acting, wooden characters, confusing plots, the overall lack of adventure, and simply the fact that it didn't seem like a Star Wars film. I can only begin my critique of Attack of the Clones by saying it is a film that corrects the mistakes made in its predecessor. Jar Jar Binks is brilliantly written into this film. Lucas knows we hate Jar Jar. So he makes the characters feel the same way about him (i.e. Amidala shutting him up). Lucas also places Jar Jar at the heart of something terrible to come, which gives us reason to hate his stupidity even more. (But at least this time, it's a deliberate move by Lucas.) Now...many critics have destroyed and mamed this second episode. I, along with generally everyone I know who has seen the film, have no idea where these criticisms originate and why. What we know is that contrary to popular critics belief, the acting is not nearly as wooden as we've been made to believe it would be. Ewan McGregor has finally settled into the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi, as he conveys a true personality that is slowly and brilliantly molding into the likes of Alec Guiness. Also, Portman, although not incredibly versatile and outstandish in this film, does an adequate job as Senator Amidala. But the man of the hour (or should I say, 2 hours and 22 minutes) is Hayden Christensen. He shows a wide range of emotion as Anakin, and he grips us right from the beginning as the unstable Jedi who's fate we already know. We loathe his cockiness, we buy his romantic seduction, and we are simply in heart-pounding awe of his turn to anger. (Let's just be frank, that evil look of his is the coolest freaking thing on the screen.) Let me end with this. The adventure is back. THIS is the Star Wars we've been waiting for. Here is a film with a sense of comedy that we didn't see in Phantom Menace at all whatsoever. (R2-D2 and C-3PO have a wonderfully comedic and heartwarmingly developing relationship and Obi-Wan and others share clever one liners). Here is a film with a sense of drama and romantic conflict (Anakin is being torn between his love for Padme and his loveless committment to the Jedi order. He is truly feeling the angst we expected him to from Obi-Wan ""holding him back"".) Here is a film with a real sense of danger and loss. Here is a film that rivals with the first 3 installments of the Star Wars saga. I won't even go into the special effects and action sequences. We all know they're amazing and breath-taking. What I must say overall is that we finally have back that feeling of adventure we had from the original SW films. And throughout the film, we have incriments of ingenious musical score that bring us back to the soaring dark horns that give an overture to the reign of the Galactic Empire in the first three films. Episode II does more than just correct its prior installment's mistakes. It goes much further. Out of a possible 10, I grade this film a 9. (Phantom Menace was a 5, Empire was a 10.) I urge you...do not go dwell on the skepticism of critics. Go in with an opened mind, and low and behold, you may likely enjoy yourself.",0.029797441364605545,0.4812544420753375

"The wait is over.  When ""Phantom Menace"" ended, I was happy.  Happy because even though it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, there was a lot of good in it. And happy because I knew the best was yet to come...but not for  3 long years.  For three years we have waited and today that wait is finally over: We have been absolved with Attack of the Clones. (Mr. Lucas, I never doubted you for a second ;) ""Clones"" is a lightspeed paced dash through the galaxy; it takes us through what should seem like a lifetime in just over two hours.  Compared to the geriatric pace of ""Phantom Menace"", this movie barely stops to breathe.  The characters are lovable in entirely new ways and the FX are awe-inspiring.  The dialogue can be clunky, and at times, downright silly, but there are still parts to be cherished.  I now view Star Wars in an entirely new light...it is all finally starting to make sense. ""Clones"" and ""Menace"" are not like the originals...they are not meant to be. These are not new versions of Episodes IV-VI...they are a continuation of them.  They are a completion of THE story, and when it becomes possible to understand them as equal parts in saga not and not as a bunch of suped-up sequels, nothing, not even Jar Jar Binks, can prevent you from being impressed.",0.2902272727272727,0.5869318181818183
"Attack of the Clones is an excellent addition to the Star Wars saga. The film sets a much more darker, moody atmosphere reminiscent of Empire'. The film's special effects are mind blowing and my only criticism would be that at some points in the film there is so much happening on the screen you just don't have time to take it all in. I suppose that what video and DVD are for. Hayden Christiansen's portrayal of the older more unruly Anakin is very convincing. You feel different emotions for the character as the film progresses. Don't get me wrong I don't think he will get an Oscar nomination, but his older version of Anakin is what it should be. The rest of the characters pick up their parts from Phantom' and develop as the story progresses. The main flaw in Phantom' was the lack of story. This film does not fall into that trap and gives the viewer lots to think about. More references to the original trilogy are made throughout the film and this helps you once again fell as if you are back in the Star Wars universe. One nice touch are the scenes set in the homestead of Owen and Beru. Shots and camera angles are exactly the same as the original film. Once you get to the battle at the end of the film you will have forgiven George Lucas for Jar Jar and the menace that was Phantom' and see the true nature of a Star Wars film. If you haven't seen this movie yet go and enjoy the experience. It will definitely make you feel young again.",0.256547619047619,0.5498511904761905
"It wasn't as boring as the last.  It was very beautiful, lots of pretty pictures and cgi that didn't actually ruin the film (shock!).

"I was definitely worried after reading countless bad articles in the paper and on the web, but I tell you...it's a all a lie.  Star Wars II is amazing, incredible, awesome.  ""Spider-Man"" is a faint memory beside this film. ""Phantom Menace"" was let's face it, a little bit of a letdown -- I did enjoy the film, but it had a great many faults.  This film is fantastic...people complain about the dialogue and the acting.  Portman is excellent as always, and Christensen is remarkable in possibly one of the most difficult roles ever!  I mean, it's been built up since the release of the Star Wars IV! There's dumbed down, teenage lovey-dovey talk, but what they hell are they suppose to say -- yes, he's a jedi and she's a senator, but they're still teenagers, who just fell in love. Lucas' direction is a lot more confident, and he leaves the comic relief to people like Obi-One and C3PO & R2 -- definitely a smarter choice then Jar-Jar.  Jar-Jar was bad, but if Lucas had cut some scenes from ""Phantom"" -- the backlash would not have been as bad. SO...go see the movie.  It's still on one of the most amazing plots and stories you'll ever see.  The intricacies are astounding...and yes the special effects are incredible.

"This film is absolutely brilliant. Whether you like Star wars or not....it doesn't matter. This film is undeniably great, not just visually but acting wise. As a Brit Ewan McGregor is fantastic, he holds the screen well and how Liam Neeson did in The Phantom Menace he pulls off being the wise Jedi very well. Obi-Wan is essential to the plot as we all should know what is going to happen but Lucas keeps us guessing how it happens. Ewan McGregor especially as he seems so strong but has this degree of humanity that when watching, the viewer can really relate to. Episode IV to VI were so brilliant because of Han Solo keeping the comic element there....were episode 1 failed is to re-create a character of comedy....they tried with Jar Jar Binks and it did work to a degree but Han Solo was really arrogant and that made him appealing..as his comic relief was essential for the whole series. In Attack of the Clones (AOTC) Hayden Christensen amazes me as his acting ability is fantastic not only does he portray Anakin as strong and arrogant but his facial expressions are fantastic and change the whole tone of the movie.....he really shows that inside Anakin is a boy who just needs to get out so he can be a man. Christensen shows this brilliant and comes across very evil at times and really keeps the viewer enthralled as he allows everyone to see how he is slowly becoming seduced by the dark side. Anakin and Obi-Wan make this film amazing to watch and u can really relate to everything that goes on. Christopher Lee in a role much like his role in Lord of The Rings is a very good bad guy and is very arrogant. He really does give Obi-wan a nemesis.....Anakin is not only battling with his feelings with the Dark Side but with Padmé...on paper a love story doesn't really fit at all into the story because Star wars seems like a guy thing...just loads of action....but how wrong we could be. Lucas doesn't over do it....but emphasises on the natural feeling between the two...and Christensen really does show how versatile he is, as an actor....the chemistry between him and Portman make the film very interesting....and like I said before abt the need for relief from an all action plot...it is a nice diversion. If you see this film you have to see it for Yoda....as Yoda is absolutely brilliant at the end....tt final scene towards the end will be remembered form years to come...as 25 years of waiting to see what Yoda can actually do is finally seen. In conclusion to this epic adventure.....Lucas stays close to the story and fuses together the fundamental key characteristics of what made Star Wars, Star Wars....he substitutes Anakins arrogance for Han Solo's comic relief....but tt alone is not enough....so he uses the diversion of a love story to ease the whole action. At the same time he runs sub-plots into the film...introducing new ideas and although the eventual ending is already known....u never quite noe where the film is going to go next. This is what George Lucas has done amazingly....Im not a person who goes to see films over and over again...but films I truly respect and love for what they do critically should be watched and watched over and over again. Star Wars and LOTR come under tt category.....but AOTC has met the hype of the two new films together....it is a joy to watch...its only friday and I have seen it 5 times.....its not sad....if you see it...you can see no matter how perceptive u r to wot is going on, on screen u always pick up on sub-plots.....and Lucas has wrote this script like a book because its so unpredictable....Jango's character should return as tt is one of the minor details tt u can only pick up on if u see this film again and again...I suggest to any1 who has seen it, to see it again even if they do not like it....give urself a chance to see how great this film is...and how it works on the five levels a film should, Sociological, philosophical, Religious, psychological and suspense...the fact AOTC is such a big budget picture and it can do this is truly amazing......if u see one film this summer see this film. Get down to the nearest theatre that shows it digitally...becasue if you see it digitally...u will just simply look in ore...of the amazing effects....in the end....ull get your money's worth even if you don't like Star Wars...its a brilliant romance...its not a Pearl Harbour romance...it has depth to it....watch it twice...because if you dunt....it will plague ur mind.",0.2119473213144099,0.5252336201070379

"I was there at the beginning and stayed until the admirable entry-point to the trio of prequels that would, we were assured, re-map the splendid beginnings of George's magnificent odyssey and usher in a whole new generation of fans who had only ever experienced the magic on VHS/BETA. No, I didn't much care for Star Wars ""Re-dux"" a couple of years ago at the cinema with the added bits for good measure. I mean, if it ain't broke, why unnecessarily lengthen and dissipate the narrative structural integrity with a plethora of CGI jiggery-pokery? For me, the original IS most definitely the best. Having said that, I was suitably impressed by ""The Phantom Menace"", a film which was chock-a-block with the aforementioned effects but which managed to develop the early incarnations of our heroes/villains suitably whilst effortlessly introducing some new faces and even throwing in some stunning set pieces (that remarkable pod-race sequence, for example) before slapping us across our drooping jaws with an intricate and splendidly edited three-way battle extravaganza at the finale. And of course...the critics disliked it as I believe did a sizeable majority of incredibly hard to please individuals. Poor ol' George must've really been scratching his head over that one. ""What in God's name did I do wrong?"", he might have said. ""I set the whole shebang in perfect motion or so I thought. Sure, the effects got most of the headlines but scrape away the CGI and I also had a solid script, some thoughtful, low-key and otherwise performances from some splendid actors, some breath-taking locales, unparalleled action sequences in the traditional Star Wars stylee and the Mother and Father of all light-sabre battles with a particularly loathsome Sith Lord who prior to a late narrative tinker, I had pencilled in to last until the beginning of Episode III. I mean, what more do you people want!?!!"" screams Curious George. O.K. folks, it appears that what George has done is pull his hair out in trying to bend and mould a once fresh-faced and truly original movie-franchise (if that's not a contradiction in terms), into a shameless hussy of a free-for-all in which everyone gets a bit of what they fancy. To hell with the original vision, here's Star Wars by the numbers with a dreadful, wise-cracking new version of once stolidly po-faced Obi-wan, a slew of cartoon-like chases and near-misses and improbable escapes. Throw in a ludicrous, ""Gladiator""-style melee with terrible creature design and a newly transformed Senator Amidala into some kind of neolithic Wonder Woman and you're really only scraping the surface of what's gone very badly wrong. I'll admit that the story-line is reasonably well adhered-to in most places and the double bluff by the fantastic Count Dooku (take a bow, Sir Christopher) will leave most people guessing till the end, but by the half way stage, no amount of shots of the supremely cool, but criminally underused Jango Fett can sway one back to full consciousness after more than an hour of a tepid romantic tale not at all suffused by a rousing finale which instead is just a large mess of flashing lights and a painfully obvious, heavily unlife-like series of skirmishes which leaves a rather unsatisfied taste in the mouth as the strains of John Williams build to the end titles. ""What did I just watch?"", I heard someone say, ""Was that Star Wars?"" piped another. ""My bleedin' eyes hurt"", moans a third. All I can add to the growing list of unsatisfied customer-speak, is why reduce one of the most famous and well-written characters to the lowly bowels of bad stand-up with shamelessly ill-judged and un-funny puns. Poor ol' Anthony Daniels must be secretly crying into his cocoa. R.I.P C-3PO. I remember when real humour and many an uproarious punchline was exacted from your uppity, cantankerous and uniquely blinkered view of the universe and not from a junior script-writer's lazy scribblings on a matchbox on the subway to one of George's crisis meetings. Ah, what the hell, bar Lee, Jango Fett and a half-way decent performance by that Danish bloke wot played Annakin, ""Attack of the Clones"" was little short of a complete disaster. Please, George, I beg you, recant, shut yourself away in a little room with some pencils and a notepad and start re-writing the third and mercifully, final instalment. Don't listen to no-one, my amply-jowlled friend, and throw your work out there into the big, wide world letting those would-be directors and screenwriters amongst us peck at the pieces and take it or leave it. After all, you don't need the money at this stage, right. Right? And to think, your good buddy Mr. S. actually went and said that AOTC was better than ""A New Hope"".....the man's loosin' his cool.

"I saw Episode 2 today, and i must say that i was truly impressed with this effort. After seeing Episode 1, i was greatly disappointed in the plot, and the casting (Jake Loyd was probably the worst Star Wars casting ever, well maybe next to N'Sync) and the amount of crappy religious elements in it. There were many scenes that could have been edited out of it such as the underwater part where they are being chased by that fish. The emaculate conception crap was laugh out loud funny in its lameness as well. I think that Lucas has listened to all the complaints from fans and tried to address them, and for the most part he suceeded. Jar-Jar actually serves a purpose in this film, and Hayden Christianson is very strong as Anakin Skywaker. He plays the role with anger, and saddness, pulling the viewer in to his struggle. Sure he is whiney, but he is also playing like a 17 year old kid so that is fine by me. He has a look about him that seems to scream evil, and he is very good in this role. Ewen McGregor is strong as well as Obi Wan. He really adds a lot to the role. His performance was very good, and he seemed to have that auora of Obi Wan greatness around him. Natalie Prtman was weak as Padame' as her performance was kind of bland and cookie cutter. Although she was the most beautiful i have ever seen her. She was gorgeous. This movie really set up the future of the Star Wars universe such as introducing the storm troopers instead of the droids. The Droids in the first movie really bugged me, as i wanted to see Strom Troopers. I was happy to see them introduced, but was shocked at their role in the movie. There were some complaints such as the Jedi were made to look like weaklings. I will not reveal how, but you will see when you watch the movie. Most of them are just pushovers. I think they tried to hard to make humour with C3PO and R2D2 and a lot of the time it didn't work. It ended up being rather lame. The fight that Yoda had was cool in the beginning, but the more i thought about it, the more laughable it was. I was chuckling when i was watching it because it was pretty outrageous. My final complaint being that Obi Wan was kind of shown to be a loser, as Anakin was correcting him and making him look stupid, and he was getting beaten up a lot, but i guess it is ok because Anakin is suppossed to be the bad ass of the universe.",0.06909090909090908,0.6020101010101008

You'd be hard pressed to find acting any worse than it gets here, from just about everybody.  Lucas has fallen in love with C.G.I. and it looks atrocious on the screen.  I'd take the effects of the first three over these new ones in a heartbeat.  George Lucas has obviously gone crazy and is tarnishing his reputation and the Star Wars franchise, which is arguably the most influential film of all time.  But this worthless dribble is without any sort of ambition, creativity, or skill. Somebody please stop Lucas from further tarnishing the series.  Good call on Hayden Christiansen, George.

"This film has many cheesy points. Many bad puns, many silly jokes, many annoying parts with Anakin the southerner and Padmé the bimbo. However, these are the only flaws I can really think of. It was a great reminder of the amazing effect a Star Wars film has on people watching it on the big screen, on premiere night. Who can forget the undying team of R2-D2 and C-3PO? Or perhaps the endless wit of Obi-Wan Kenobi? Most noteworthy are the battles, where dozens of Jedi (far more than the usual one or two) are shown in battle against hundreds of droids, lightsabers swishing? These things bring life to the film. If you're in it for the plot, I must warn you that the greatest impediment to this trilogy (I, II, & III) is that we already know how things turn out. Because of that, George [Lucas] has a huge restraint on storyline. Many events must conveniently coincide, or the purpose of the films are lost. That said, my advice is ignore the crummy Ani-Padmé bits, and concentrate on the battles, which to me are more spectacular than ever. Yoda is a true pro, and in order to keep the novelty up, I won't say any more about him. Just keep in mind that no matter WHAT people say against this film, YODA will be the word to bring them back. Nothing, absolutely nothing beats his performance in Clones!",0.21944444444444441,0.6385802469135803
"As somebody whose main complaint about The Phantom Menace was that it was too computer generated, it was inevitable that I would say the same about Attack Of The Clones.  With this, Episode II, the special effects are greatly improved, as is the story.  Depth is added to characters, the action is spectacular, and in short this is a great deal better than Episode I. However, this movie fails where The Phantom Menace succeeded in that Yoda is now completely CG.  He looks unbelievably synthetic and is, in my opinion, far too different from the Yoda in the other installments of the Star Wars saga.  It can be said quite correctly that Yoda need be CG for some parts of the film, but a more traditional and realistic puppet could have been used for the majority of his screen time.  Nevertheless, this is tremendously enjoyable, action packed fun which needs to be seen on the big screen...and needs to be seen more than once!",0.18161904761904762,0.4915238095238095

"Anybody wondered why Aliens, Blade Runner, Predator were such good movies ? a) a good plot and decent dialogs, and b) great acting. How could Mr. Lucas hire Hayden Christensen for a lead role - he should have remained in Canadian sope operas, who is so wooden he could make up for the Yoda's missing cane. All he does is glimpses from underneath his eyebrows to express some emotions.

"Surprise- Hayden Christiansen was not as bad as I feared. However, the CGI effects were as distracting as expected. In my opinion creature effects hit their pinnacle in the 80s with films like Dragonslayer and Aliens. Nothing in the past 20 years can surpass those in realism. The CGI characters in SW 2 were just not tangible or  believable. Yoda was the closest thing to a success in this area but he looked like Sonic the Hedgehog during his duel (even though that was the most entertaining sequence in the film.) Overall all SW 2 was such a vast improvement over Phantom Menace that you have to be somewhat pleased but it is still is light years behind Empire which it desperately sought to emulate (protector and princess fall in love, severed limbs, asteroid chases, etc). Maybe its the Byzantine politics instead of rag tag heroes trying to oppose the ultimate bad guy. It's hard to figure out who you should hate.",-0.03377192982456138,0.6118421052631579

So Star Wars purists will probably say, what gives me the right to criticise this movie. At the end of the day, I am a movie fan, and can recognise a good movie from a bad movie, and this one sucked, where do I start, acting, script, effects, lack of cohesive story arc.  At least they restricted the terminally annoying Jar-Jar-Binks to little more than a cameo role.  Ewan mcGregor sounded like a cross between Biggles and a Pathe News announcer, 'what the blazes!' and 'a clone armer!' amongst his more memorable lines.  The attempts at humour were risable.  Annikin just looked and acted like any surly pubescant teenager from an aussie soap, christ I was expecting him to runaway from home if he did not get his own way, that'll teach the grown-ups. Yoda trying to bellow orders in is his back to front English, 'The Space Ships, aim for, you must' any trooper would say 'what the **** did he just say' As for Christopher Lee, was he just practising his Saruman role.

"First of all: I enjoyed myself. But that's as far as it goes. Even though EP-II has its moments, I think the domination of CGI makes this film (and EP-I) look pale in comparison to the EP IV, V and VI. Most of the space-ships are too smooth, too fake to be believable. Where as the actual steal of e.g. The Millenium Falcon made it more real. The old spaceships, aliens etc. were made, created and built out of real material and even though a lot the time they were scale-models and Lucas used trick-filming, it worked good.

"For all those thinking that George Lucas had lost the Midas touch, think again.  Attack of the Clones is one of the most exhilarating, breathtaking cinematic experiences I have ever had, and more than does justice to the original trilogy.  The film looks incredible, the action sequences are mind-altering, and the acting, from Sam Jackson to Temuera Morrison to the great Christopher Lee, is top notch.  The question on everyone's mind has been, what about Hayden Christiansen?  His performance will be the most hotly debated aspect of this movie.  Your like or dislike of this film hinges on your like or dislike of his performance.  I feel he nailed it. This is a boy, not yet 20 years old, who is aware that he may one day fulfill the prophecy of bringing balance to the Force.  He is brash, cocky, impulsive, and arrogant, almost like a star athlete in high school who knows he's one of the best in the country.  His awkward interaction with Senator Amidala is what you would expect from a teenager trying to impress an older, mature woman.  Couple that with the fact that, because of his code as a Jedi apprentice, he has less than zero knowledge of women, and you find a boy trying to be a man without understanding the responsibilities a man must undertake.  I fully bought Anakin and Padme's love story, and could see the undercurrent of destructiveness inherent in it.  Overall, this movie is unbelievable.

That said I'll now put my reputation and quite possibly my life on the line here. I LOVED Episode I!!! It had what this film is missing, that Star Wars feel. Lucas has always said that he made Star Wars for 13 year old boys. Episode I had that feeling. While, yes, I did find Jar Jar annoying, he was no worse or more distracting than the Ewoks from Return of the Jedi.

When Jango Fett *spoiler sort of* gets his head cut off by Windu and Boba Fett picks it up, it seems like his head would have fallen out or something. And im confused, if you are cut by a lightsaber, are you supposed to bleed? because i think Anakin bled when Dooku * spoiler sort of* cut off his hand, but Jango didnt bleed. At the Arena scene, Pamde get cut on her back, right? So why does her shirt get cut like in half? Im not arguing or anything (eh heh eh heh) but it makes no sense. And at the end of the scene C-3P0 and R2D2 are still in the Arena, and at the end somehow they get out.

The visuals are incredible, the sets and backgrounds are breathtaking, the special effects are what we have come to expect, groundbreaking, and the battle scenes are unreal.  Seeing Yoda in action alone is worth seeing the film!  The dialogue and acting, while still typically Lucas-style choppy, are better than Phantom Menace, and Hayden Christenson is a force (excuse the pun) to be reckoned with in Hollywood. He delivers a great performance as a coming of age Jedi struggling with the inner demons that will eventually lead him to... well, we all know where he ends up.  But despite that foreknowledge, you're still captivated by him and the rollercoaster ride of his emotions. AOTC follows the same pattern that Lucas established with the first trilogy. While A New Hope, and subsequently Phantom Menace were bright, colorful films, which mainly introduce us to the essential characters and give a thin base story from which to launch the rest of the trilogy, Attack of the Clones in turn follows Empire Strikes Back step for step.  It is dark and brooding, like Empire, it has 2 separate plots which branch out, and then come back together, like Empire, and ends with a battle scene eerily similar to Empire's climax.  And in the same frustrating and wonderful way as Empire, Clones raises far more questions than it answers.",0.21848548510313212,0.46586198115609884
"The drones and robots could have done a better acting job.  Just when I thought the series couldn't get any worse, here it is.   Episode II, an even more unstable, unstructured, boring, badly if edited at all, emotionless, sloppy, terrible attempt at movie genius.  The only thing that makes the movie bearable is the special effects, which is nothing in comparison when compared to all of the other movies that came out that year.  No originality, eye widening, or gasping scenes.  The plot line is as a zig zag line, or even a dotted line, which stops and goes in different directions without reaching any impacting climax at the end.  The romantic relationship between Anakin and the Princess was awkward, due to the fact that he was eight years old when they first met, and she was a teenager.   In addition it was just out right lame, forced, and both actors had no chemistry together.  (Spoilers)  The worse was the ending, which is a rushed action scene in which there is no impact at all to the audience, and in the end, Anakin's arm is chopped off with no emphasis.  Then in a pathetic attempt to awe the audience Yoda fights the bad guy.  This is just terrible, but then again, the bad guy really had no deep conflict with any of the characters, so it didn't matter who fought him.  Then the scene in addition is chopped, and we are hurled into the next scene with a horrible ceremony, with two emotionless, bad actors getting married.  I have no idea why this movie received such high reviews, I have no idea how it could make over $300 million dollars just by being a follow-up of it's superior predecessors. Everyone complains about Jar Jar, he was the only character that brought life and feeling to the movie.  Now that is sad.  All I can say is that it is a terrible movie, and I will not waste a penny to see the next one.

Oh dear! Maybe it's me, but I'd get as much enjoyment from and episode of Star Trek. While I can admire the geniuses that created the look of the film, the problem is the script. It is just too simplistic, for what is supposedly a big theme, epic movie... The actors looked uncomfortable throughout, and apart from the ""It's star wars!"" factor, I can't imagine why they would want to do it... Another thing, I appreciate that the film is part of a series, but shouldn't each episode be able to stand alone in terms of entertainment? At the end of this film, there is an overwhelming sense that it is unfinished, like an episode of a Danielle Steele mini-series, following a great family dynasty over 60 or 70 years... ""tune in, in 2005, to find out what happens next between Anakin and Amidala, and find out if Obi Wan Kenobi can save the galaxy before his beard turns white"". With Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings, I didn't get the same sense of incompletion. This is probably going too far, but the film feels like a giant advertisement for Star Wars Inc.

"**(Possible Spoilers Ahead!!)** Attack of the Clones is a wonderful film worthy of the name, ""Star Wars"". Lucas seems to have generally listened to his fans and added (or removed) things that left Episode 1 with a sour feeling for some.  This time around, expect to see: 1). a smaller, less annoying role for Jar-Jar Binks, 2). SPECTACULAR battles (with some of the most memorable scenes in the entire series), 3). an engrossing and informative story--complete with many scenes, lines, and characters that begin to tell the story of things to come, and 3). very good acting--some of the best of the series (including exceptional performances from Ewen Mcgregor and Yoda).  I will try not spoil to much as the film needs to be seen.  It focuses on Anakin Skywalker--now grown--protecting the former Queen--now Senator Padme' Amidala from a few assassination attempts and their growing love affair.  Meanwhile, Obi-wan has put on the detective hat and begins looking into the identity of the assassin and a mysterious Clone Army.  More into the film, as the action begins to heat up, the film culminates into quite possibly the best action sequences of the entire series--with an emphasis on a terrific Yoda.  All in all, I would highly recommend seeing this film, as it contains all the plot, action, and intrigue that a Star Wars fan could ask for.",0.2501041666666667,0.5480208333333333

I would have been just as happy if they had fast fowarded thru the first 2 hours, and push play when we get to the Yoda fight. This was the only thing that I enjoyed.

Obi Wan follows Fett to the leaders of the Separatist movement, Count Dooku.  Fett is working for Dooku, who tells Obi Wan about the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious. Dooku even tells Obi Wan that Sidious has control of the Senate. Now, Dooku himself is a rogue Jedi.  He leads the battle against the Jedi. Master Jedi Mace Windu not only sees Fett with Dooku, but decapitates him. Why is the dark side so mysterious?  Because Lucas is playing the Jedi mind trick on the weak minded masses.  A clear minded six-year-old could figure it out.  My nephew did.  So why are Yoda, Master Windu, and Obi Wan so baffled.  Because Lucas is using cool special effects for misdirection.

Unfortunately, it's the human element -- the actors, scripts and dialogue -- that is a major disappointment. No one has conversations. They give speeches, and some are unintentionally funny, even during serious moments. No one truly seem connected on any level, except that the script says they have relationships of one sort or another. Except for Christopher Lee, who does an excellent turn as an evil Jedi,  the main actors are outclassed by their computer generated co-stars. Quite frankly, I've seen better acting in junior high school productions. The core of the storyline is a split within the Republic that some are trying to heal. But it's never explained why it's such a tragedy that it's happening. And the cutting between one plot line to another was maddening at times. All in all, it's a jumbled mess. The required light saber fights and the battle scenes were spectacular, but in other parts of the film, the computer generated effects just got in the way, as the frame was filled with so many moving objects it was hard to tell what the audience was supposed to be looking at.

"Well it is excellent.  I did not expect an intellectual film, this isn't Frank Herbert, but what it does do it does very well.  The visual effects remain stunning which is no mean feat.  Lucas created a standard for special effects which others struggled to keep up with.  By the time the Phantom Menace was released the effects had become commonplace...this film recovers Lucas' lead in this area. The role of the hero/putative villain is central. In episode I Anakin was necessarily a horrible little kid with a grating voice - after all nobody could imagine a young Darth Vader as anything but unpleasant. In this episode he is exactly right although it is hard to see how the American government allowed this one to get through! I will not give the plot away but Anakin's reaction to his mother's fate on Tattooine is a very good motivation for his eventual turn to the dark side...signified by the use of dark side music for the first time with this character.  The analogy with the Americans in Afghanistan was pretty blatant.",0.0627245670995671,0.5249837662337663
I was satisfied with how this movie turned out. It was alot better than The Phantom Menance. The biggest battle scene ever in a Star Wars movie was in this one and I enjoyed it. The best parts of the movie were the parts on Geonosis and one part on Tatooine with Anakin. There were the parts on Kamino which were good too. I did happen to like Obi-Wan better in Episode 1 than in this one. There were alot more Jedi in this one and I really liked that alot. My favorite character was Anakin though. I really enjoyed the part where he fought Dooku. Yoda has a couple of surprises in store for everyone in this one. The Clone Wars starts and the Republic is beginning to crumble and will eventually become the Empire. We also get to see the Clonetroopers who will become Stormtroopers I think. Overall this was a good movie and much better than episode one.,0.5384615384615384,0.5923076923076922

Apparently we were supposed to meet his character earlier on, but instead we just see Victor Sifuentes standing amongst intergalactic senators.

"First, let me note that I have been a steady defender of Episode I. I've defended Jar Jar Binks, Jake Lloyd, and the sometimes wooden acting and bad dialouge of the first prequel. After all, when I go to see a Star Wars film, I'm not looking for Oscar quality performances or some deep insight into the meaning of life; I'm looking to be entertained. I've been entertained for over 25 years by the original trilogy and by Episode I (to a lesser extent...but still entertained). With that out of the way let me say that Episode II is one of the biggest train wrecks of cinema history. True, this movie will make hundreds of millions of dollars - give yourself a hand Mr. Lucas, you've accomplished what is evidently your only goal. Episode I was flawed but I had high hopes Lucas would raise the bar with this film and bring to the screen the epic battles of the Clone Wars we've been waiting for...along with the first signs of Anakin's turn to the dark side. Anakin...oh, Anakin. First Jake Lloyd and now Hayden Christensen. Who in the hell ever thought this guy could act in commercials, let alone one of the biggest franchises in the history of movies. Bottom line...he's terrible. Not that he had a chance with the juvenile dialouge given to him (and nearly everyone else) by Mr. Lucas and Mr. Hale. At two points I started laughing out loud at the ponderous and cheesy ""romantic"" exchanges between Anakin and Amidala. Give me a break! The epic battle scenes we've imagined? Replaced by more CGI robots vs. uninteresting humans in front of blue screens. Because that's what you've reduced Star Wars to George. No one except you, your army of yes-men, and yes-fans are amazed by CGI anymore...it's old hat my friend. It's been around for over 10 years, get over it. Don't get me wrong, ILM does a magnificant job with what was put on their plate. But my question is...why? Why have such a ridiculous number of CGI shots? We didn't need them to suspend our belief 20 years ago and we don't need all of them now. I love good CGI if it's used only when there's no other way of making something happen on screen. Lucas uses it constantly.  Even if they used a cardboard and plastic set  it may look a little phony but it's actually there, and our minds know this. I'd like to know how many sets were built for this movie, maybe 3? Regardless of how good the effects are, our brains still register it as not really there...and it takes away from the experience. Consider a scene where Amidala and Anakin have lunch: did everything except the table have to be CGI? No...a set could have been built and the movie (and actors) would have benefitted from it. Lucas, however, is so in love with his computers he's lost the human element of his movies. This is what Star Wars used to be all about. There is one crowning achievement in CGI in this film though: Yoda. Not only does he show why he's THE master (in a lightsaber fight that desperately needed him to give it a spark) but he's the best ""actor"" in this movie. Which pretty much sums up the problems with this movie: when a CGI character outclasses all the humans, you've got a problem. Attack Of The Clones: big on special effects; small on emotion, dialogue, competent acting/directing, and carrying on a film legacy. Note to George Lucas: if you still care you have a GIGANTIC task ahead of you with Episode III. Please return this franchise to some respectability. I know your rich and think you can do no wrong but you have. Not all Star Wars fans are mindless sheep following the pack. Please restore our faith. Until then, I'm going to see installment 2 of the ""real"" trilogy of the 21st century: The Lord of the Rings! I suggest you do the same. You'll see movies made with a love and character I think you've ever known, and CGI used beautifully only where it's really needed.",0.07976946334089191,0.5009750566893426

The actors spent most of their time in front of a blue screen.

You don't even have to buy it, just read Mythmaking: Behind the Scenes of Attack of the Clones; it's very informative. Episodes I-III are very plot heavy. Each scene means something to the whole. And this episode is very necessary in making Anakin's pledge to the Dark Side work. If you don't watch this first or take what happens in this film as laid groundwork, then Anakin's turn in Revenge of the Sith will sound forced and contrived.

Perfect. The perfect way to connect Episodes I and II. The movie starts out quickly by delivering the fact that someone is trying to kill Senator Amidala. Unlike most movies, it brings that point to a brief, sharp point. Technology seems updated and more advanced than in Episode I (*NOTE: Episode I did not have technology that was too futuristic. Rather, their technology was hot-roddish.), and similarities in the technology between Episode I and II do exist so the technology doesn't seem so different that it was fake.

George Lucas and Jonathan Hales, once writers now undertakers, guilty to have buried the corpse supplying dialogues from soap operas to a love story already poor, and a psychological deepening worthy of an ugly comic (look at the scene of the encounter between Anakin and the mother, than he did not see from years). The authors of beautiful and narcissuses special effects , whose vanity has given the blow of grace to a film series that had been full of poetry without computer and with little models of plastic and cardboard. The motive of the massacre is to be found in the dirty money and large economic interests, that they have carried to re-work, after 20 years, three films that did not have sure need of additions.

"I guess I am a relatively young Star Wars fan since I don't remember seeing the original trilogy the first time, it was just something that I grew up with.  I also wasn't disappointed with Episode I because unlike a lot of Star Wars fans, I know that this is George Lucas's story to tell and I would rather enjoy it than look for its flaws.  That said, I think that this was one of the more enjoyable films of the group.  As always, the visuals are amazing and the story line is good, but it was worth the price of admission alone for the battle sequence at the end.  They don't call him ""MASTER"" Yoda for nothing!  Hayden Christensen also did a really good job with his character, having the perfect balance between the whining young Anakin we saw in Episode I and the angry and powerful Vader we see later on in the story.  There are a lot of characters introduced in this film that have roles in episodes IV though VI and there are some loose ends that are tied up very nicely.  I know a lot of people were concerned with the pace of this movie since a large portion of it centers around Anakin and Amidala's relationship. However, the beginning of the film is intriguing, the middle of the film is full of adventure and like I said above, the climax is amazing!  I came out of this film with a wonderful feeling of fulfillment, even at 3 o'clock in the morning.",0.31869450549450545,0.5632454212454213
"Yoda the swordbearer! There's no word for that. You shoulda see the sword handling skill of Yoda including awesome Force skill. So many Jedi came to this movie, and left only 12 high council member. But only one Jedi will prevail, it's Yoda. Dark Lord got bigger power, not much like Darth Maul. This movie for Star Wars fan. Every little thing for big fans, such as R2-D2 is climbing up the stairs including extra booster on his legs, Owen Lars and Aunt Beru, Bail Organa, and Boba Fett, the unaltered clone of Jango. Some scenes are really breathtaking. There are some glitches like Anakin's acting (I mean Hayden something) is not fulfilled the subtle shaking of character. He's got great power, but still he can't control of it. Obi-wan can't lead him properly, maybe Qui-Gon would be do better, but there lies the tragedy. Anakin admires and jealous on Obi-Wan because he is very obstinate person, who doesn't allow anything harm to Jedi council and Republic. Some frustrating on Anakin and hidden anger and love, which was taken away by Jedi Order. He needs love more than anything. He lost his mother, and some replacement for it, Amidala the Queen. She was departing to Naboo and Senate. Therefore, he lost everything, mother, Qui-Gon, Padme. These are very hard to perform by a newcomer. I think episode II's Anakin is most complex character in Star Wars saga. If Hayden step up his acting, the movie will become instant classic. But he's fail on short margin. Still this movie is worth to watch several times. So many layers and to-be-founds. Enjoy this movie!",0.10506410256410256,0.4473931623931624

An impressive plotline that begins to connect the entire saga's story, well-developed characters that touched all emotions, and, of course, fast-paced action scenes that will impress both Star Wars fans and average moviegoers, are all reasons to see the movie. And if none of this draws you, then see it just to watch Yoda in battle!

"After twenty five years, and a host of very well done and entertaining movies through the 80's and 90's, by fantastic directors such as Spielberg and Cameron, the original Star Wars is still my choice as the best movie of all time.  It combines a very fast-paced plot with a deep feeling for character development, attention to cinematographic detail, and innovations in special effects to make the film possible. You could not suck in every thing the first or second time, it took multiple viewings to appreciate all of the details and foreshadowing hidden within the witty lines.  The second movie `Empire Strikes Back' mostly built on the strengths of the first movie with its continued fast pace,  and detailed plot and character development.",0.2364512471655329,0.45578231292516996
"Many have said that this Episode is much better than its predecessor, The Phantom Menace. I would have to disagree. It's just as bad, if not worse. The reaction of the audience at the showing I saw as they came out was subdued and most had glum faces. Not a good sign. While it looks like Lucas has tried to respond to his critics e.g. cutting out the kiddie humour and upping the action element, this time he's excelled himself by giving us by one of the worst on screen romance in the history of cinema, some awful dialogue, flat acting and a pretty dull plot. Some people have also compared this episode with 'The Empire Strikes Back', but to be quite honest 'Clones' is not worthy of licking its boots.",-0.08725490196078431,0.5818627450980391

Jar Jar Binks is given mercifully little screen time, but any screen time for that abomination is a crime against humanity. George Lucas should think about making some other films every now and then.

"As soon as the music hits and ""Star Wars"" blazes onto the screen, you are thrown back to a time long ago, when you only knew of George Lucas from American Graffiti. This excitement builds whenever I see the intro, and I am always reminded of the first time I saw A New Hope. You realize this is going to be a great theatrical experience but then you remember... The Phantom Menace made me feel the same way too, that is, until those three paragraphs faded out of view and the movie started. Without giving anything away, I want to say full out that this film is NOT THE PHANTOM MENACE. This is old school Star Wars with new school special effects, plain and simple. We have everything, good guy gusto and bad guy brashness. From the first thrilling scenes to the final close that leaves you wanting more, I felt a tingle that kept with me long after the final credits rolled. But... with all reviews, I have to give some shortcomings. First, the characterization is better (much better) than Menace, but it still feels like Christiansen and most obviously Portman actually have to dumb down their acting skills to play these characters. They don't overact... it's just that they have traditionally played more in depth roles (Life as a House for Christiansen, and Portman's enitire catalog except Menace). Aside from this and one other shortcoming (Yoda is all animated... I miss the puppet. The puppet worked, and looked real enough. Yoda actually gives the movie a cartoony, video game feel.)The movie is fantastic. Most other performances are done extremely well, and for those who think this movie will ruin the classic star wars experience, it won't. I feel it will enhance what you already love, because like I said before... IT IS NOT THE PHANTOM MENACE.",0.12106126197035288,0.47027335038698675

I was most interested in seeing that above everything else, and I feel horribly let down in that aspect right away.  From there, the movie did not seem to visually entrap me like was promised with the hype. What really killed the film for me, however was the horrible acting/dialog. I found myself laughing outloud at many parts simply due to the acting being so bad.  If you are true film buff and bad acting/dialog pains you, then skip this movie!

"As a major fan of these films, I was elated that this film finally delivered on all cylinders what the past two haven't: an equal to the first two movies. Lucas crams all the excitement and flash of ""A New Hope"" into a film which somehow manages to also provide enough soul-searching and romance to rival ""The Empire Strikes Back"". After two efforts that seemed to be aimed toward a younger audience, Lucas gets you excited about Episode 3 again by making ""Attack of the Clones"" a true gem. Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman turn in grade A performances as Obi Wan and Padme, and Hayden Christensen does as well as can be expected with such a complex role. In one scene, Christensen gives us a fine preview of a dark-force immersed Anakin when he lets anger get the best of him. Lucas seems to have been stung by fan criticism of the Jar Jar Binks character, as Binks is a very minor player in this one. Jimmy Smits as Bail Organa also has a very small role, but will likely have a much bigger role in the next film. The droids provide a few light moments that are enjoyable. Watch for a part where 3PO says ""I'm scrap!"" I got quite a laugh on that one. Christopher Lee plays Count Dooku (Darth Tyrannus) with ease, endowing the character with the same strength of presence that Sir Alec Guinness gave ""Old Ben"" Kenobi in the original series. Samuel L. Jackson gets a much bigger role as Mace Windu this time around, and is up to the task. The fight scenes are, once again, finely choreographed and well shot, and if that isn't enough to get you running to the theater: YODA WITH A LIGHT SABER! No spoilers here, but let me say one thing about this scene: if you saw it in person, you might want to laugh....but then you REALLY wouldn't want to tick Yoda off! Minor complaints: A few of the supporting actors seemed cardboard and stiff at times, but that's been true with all the Star Wars films.

Though it is hard to judge as a single movie, it is easier to review when seen as an EPISODE of the Star Wars Saga. Attack of the Clones brings strong and important elements to the Star Wars whole while offering to the viewer a non-stop, very entertaining chapter to the Saga. I strongly suggest the first time viewer to watch the previous Star Wars chapters in order to fully appreciate this film. No film since the late Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut have offer me that kind of visual stimulation. Simply beautiful. Critics that says the film is slow-paced must be living on another planet.

My only remark is that the gravity of Anakin's seduction might not be clear enough for non fans for there is no previous discussion of the power of the dark side.

"This is by far the best of the Star Wars films to date, there is a great balance in the force here. The story is good, the humour is funny and dry, not slapstick. The action is spectacular and only used to enhance the story, not as a set piece to wow the audience. The final battles are amazing, Yoda is one cool M.F. (as is Samuel L.) there are some unexpected twists and turns and even few 'in jokes' (try to spot the X-Wing, TIE fighter and Millenium Falcons).",0.2955555555555555,0.7266666666666667

"After ""Phantom Menace"" I didn´t expect anything else than - well: nothing. I got to admit, though, that I entered one of the first screenings, after all, Star Wars is something for the child in our hearts. In a nutshell: nice tie-in´s to the already existing parts, nice SFX, nice customes, the final battle is awesome, the Clone army rocks, and unfortunately the script sucks in some crucial moments. Annakins love medley at the fire hearth is cheesy, the rolling-and-frolicking in the grass is the purest cliché, and poor mummy dies exactly after he arrives - this was especially unforgivable. Both scenes have their reason, but their really cheaply written. Too bad.",0.11250000000000002,0.7781249999999998
"George Lucas once again delivers a special effect, space ace, wonder story with his 5 installment of the Star Wars series Attack of the Clones.  This movie was definitely made for the fans, with it constant and sometime overbearing references to later occurring Star Wars movies.  Myself, as a fan, got chuckles and warm feelings inside at the re-uttering of classic lines, musical cues, and of course character cameos.  Sometimes Lucas intently or not steps over the line and movie becomes more about giving props and filling the notions of what if and wouldnt it be cool if instead of creating a good story.  But this can be easily forgiven because it is fun to watch these flies of fancy.  Ewan McGregors sophomore performance of Obi-Wan Kenobi was more like Sir Alec Guinness of the original moves, which I found more to my liking and more fitting to this film since the character has grown up some.  Natalie Portman performance of now Senator Amidala wasnt her greatest work ever but more than adequate.  Hayden Christensen as the teenage Anakin Skywalker I found to be extremely fitting but little heavy-handed in the passionate scenes, where it counted.  And Samuel L. Jackson was Samuel L. Jackson and the role was written for him.  So in conclusion, this movie was made for the fans.  So if you are a fan of Star Wars you have already seen it and if you are not a fan you might enjoy the special effects, fight scenes, and Samuel being Samuel.  I give the movie a 7.5 out of 10.",0.33211996336996336,0.47921245421245423
"Attack of The Clones is a significantly better film than The Phantom Menace, and even the original 3, in many respects.  George Lucas summed it up perfectly in 3 words: ""The plot thickens.""  Everything you saw in Episode I (Jedi battles, new worlds, amazing creatures, grand armies, etc.) is magnified.  The characters of Yoda, Mace Windu, Padmé, Anakin and Obi-Wan are well-developed, and Jar Jar is only on screen 3 times.  Cinematically it is technically superior and visually more interesting.  There are still minor, noticeable difficulties with interaction between the actors and CGI characters.  More specifically, when an actor is pictured touching or riding a CGI, and there is quite a lot of this.  Suspension of disbelief comes easily.  The CGI creatures in Episode II are the scariest yet, and may be a little much for the younger viewers.  Nevertheless, this may be the best of the five movies, simply due to its overall importance to the story, the well-written script, and the technical achievement.",0.34464531680440774,0.5233126721763085

Attack of the clones has a lot more action and adventure, and just... well, it's great! And of course, YODA IS THE GREATEST LIGHTSABER MASTER EVER!!!

"I've got really mixed feelings here. On the one hand it's Star Wars, so it must be great, but the evidence speaks otherwise. I should say that we went to see it twice, and my opinions changed a little on the second viewing. First time through, I thought it was terrible. The dialogue was atrocious-that line about sand being coarse etc. plumbed new depths. I've played video games with better dialogue. And the guy that plays Anakin is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. I guess the material doesn't help, but Harrison Ford pulled it off in Empire. The pacing is clumsy to say the least. From the first time Anakin opens his mouth you are sledgehammered with his rebellious nature, and those brooding glares he pulls at the camera every few scenes made him look constipated. He couldn't even deliver the most famous line in Star Wars history: ""I've got a bad feeling about this"". What's with ninja Yoda? I appreciate that he is supposed to the best with a light sabre but I thought it would be cooler if, despite his skills he never has to fight. The battle with Dooku at the end looked like leftover scenes from Willow until the light sabre battle which sort of looked good in a Hong Kong action movie sort of way, but just didn't fit right in the movie.",0.10560741341991343,0.5009830447330447

"To be treated to such a wonderful movie experience is a unique time to let yourself go and forget everything around you.  I could not do this with Spider-man.  I just didn't like it.  It was ok.  With that said, one week later I saw Attack of the Clones.  This movie is lightyears ahead of Spider-man.  Everything work, even the slapstick comedy and the play on words.  The visual scope od the picture is outstanding.  The two new planets, as well as the additions to the old one (i.e. Naboo and Coruscant) really give the audience a real perspective at not only the beauty, but also the dark and gritty elements that has made the original trilogy so great. The acting is fine.  Anyone who says Hayden Christensen i playing Anakin too arrogantly is right.  That's the character.  Anakin is an arrogant person. This is what makes him greedy for power.  The love story works.  Natlie Portman and Christensen provide a truly ramantic love story that makes you feel that they should be together, while also hinting at their togetherness' inevitable destruction.  The action sequences weere unlike any I have ever seen.  The chase sequence, the asteroid field, the arena, and the lightsabers all look spectacular.  The one character that really does steal the movie is Yoda.  We already knew he was a Jedi Master, now we see why. Lucas has enhanced his vision tremendously.  The Phantom Menace was a decent movie, though not the greatest ever.  Attack of the Clones makes The Phantom Menace a better movie.

I am still not sure what it was, but everything about it was irrelevant to the story line of star wars. Episode II on the other hand, is in the line of what you might expect from a star wars move.

It might have been five minutes his whole fight scene but it was the sweetest five minutes of cinema for one moviegoer in their life. I believe Mr Lucas should redesign the Attack of The Clones movie poster and just put Yoda on there in his karate stance. For me the movie now just has Yoda written all over it. When the 2003 Oscars come the Academy should make a break on the usual traditions and award Yoda for his action performance. This would be one moment I would love to see happen in my life.

Seeing him in other movies and TV shows he is actually a good actor.the Story line is interesting and the action sequences are amazing. It starts with a bounty hunter trying to Kill Padme and ending with an amazing but short light saber fight between yoda and count dooku.

"Much had been riding on Attack of the Clones. It was, after all, expected to make up for The Phantom Menace which, despite unfair galactic sized expectations, still came across as shockingly flat and uninspired. And to its credit, Clones manages to create a sense of adventure and excitement that Menace simply lacked. Clones was also blessed with an edge of maturity that Menace desperately needed i.e. very little Jar Jar Binks and no Jake Loyd. However, when all is said and done, Clones reflects the same stylistic abyss that turned Menace into an artistic farce: there is very little emotion in the telling of this tale. Indeed, the wide contrast between the film's visual splendor and its dull characterization makes it obvious where Lucas' heart lies as a filmmaker. And this problem is compounded by the fact that the prequels revolve around politics, diplomacy, and romance.

He manages every time to produce a wonderful movie and have people go back multiple times to see it again! After seeing this one, I just can't wait 3 YEARS to see the 3rd and final eps. He also managed to get the 2 most perfect people to play Anakin and Padme'. I'd also like to say that John Williams did an awesome job with the music. The love theme was out of this world. He was able to make it hauntingly romantic and fill it with so much passion and emotion. I'd go back again just to hear the music in-person (and of course for the whole movie! lol) I also think that Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen did a tremendous job. It always helps out the movie when the 2 most important characters (who are in-love) have...oh, what's the word...CHEMISTRY! (which they had ALOT of.) The two did beautifully! And for those few...very few people out there who maybe didn't like the story.... just the whole Yoda ""fight"" scene would be enough to get anyone to go back and see it again.

But let's not talk about that movie, let's talk about the Attack of the Clones. Alright, I had no f***ing clue what was going on. Something about the Trade Federation, Clones.....eh? After five minutes, I had blocked the plot from my mind because I couldn't understand it for the life of me. I thought the special effects would be great. PLEASE! I would rather have the tennis shoe as a spaceeship anyday over all the massive heaps of computer bullsh*t Lucas threw at me. Every frame looked fake. That in turm made me think of the movie as a joke. Lucas was too over zealous on special effects...they looked God awful. Well there always was the love story. What love story? Natalie Portman is hideous in the movie. She wears freaky-ass cloths that happen to get ripped off in key moments. And Hayden Christensen. He's freaking hot at all, but I had to laugh whenever he had his stupid ass little nervous break down thing. There was no love story. The lines were stupid and the actors couldn't pull it off. Maybe we should blame it on Lucas for writing such a sh****y love story. After all, he is no romance writer. Then again, he can't write a decent movie script, either!

"Episode 2 goes on to confirm that the Star Wars universe can only be appreciated by fans only. I liked Episode 2. I liked Episode 1 as well. In fact I watched Ep1 3x in the cinema and never once got bored with it. I liked the characters in both Ep1 and Ep2. I didn't think Jar Jar Binks was annoying. In fact without him Ep1 would have been really dull (Ep 4,5 and 6 had C-3PO to provide the fun factor why not Jar Jar for Ep1 considering C-3PO only had a minor role in Ep1). I think the acting was good. Typical Star Wars. No nonsense, polite (compared to movies these days).  The story is well told and I dare say the ending was one of the only few movies this past year that raised a few Oh I see.... Example: And I thought Count Dooku was..... Oh I didn't expect him to...... And what do you know, both sides were...... And that's why he did it. He wanted to.... This is what happened to me in the end. Truely rare. The only other movie that came close to it was Sixth Sense. I really don't understand critics these days. In fact I think people should always remember the critics name and institution he/she from when reading such critics. Why? I guarantee that the same person would have gone to the cinema and criticised 8 out of 10 movies he/she is supposed to review. It has its faults I admit but waw is that bad till some critics gave it a D???? If it got a D, then almost all other films out there should have gotten a Z. Special effects criticised. Too computer based. Well whether all the critics like it or not, this is the future of Science Fiction.",0.015476190476190477,0.5409688013136289
"When I went to the theater I had butterflies in my stomach. As I am 26 years old, I grew up with Star Wars and they are still my favorites. When I saw TPM I thought: Well, this is just a warm up for Episode II and III. Now that I've seen AOTC I'm very very very very disappointed. Man, how could George Lucas make a Star Wars movie this way. All the magic, mystery is gone. Instead we get a supersweet Titanic in Space story, including grass fields in which they run to each other. I just started to fall asleep when the excellent ending came. I've got to admit, the ending is one of the best endings ever, but Mr. Lucas: please make Episode III A STAR WARS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!.",0.29999999999999993,0.6357142857142858
"Like so many other die hard fans, I waited in line for the midnight showing to see this film, and now I am completely regretting my decision. While it was better than Phantom Menace, as a life-long Star Wars fan, I take offense that Lucas thinks he can get away with putting the worst love story ever into an otherwise interesting action movie. The film would have been so much better if 90% of the dialogue that Amidala and Anikin have together was cut from the movie. Star Wars fans are smarter than Lucas thinks. WE KNOW that Anikin and Amidala fall in love when they're not supposed to. Otherwise, Episodes 4, 5, and 6 don't make sense. Just showing scenes of them enjoying each other's company in the beautifully landscaped scenes would be enough to get the point across. Instead we have to endure crappy lines like ""Everything here is soft and smooth"", and ""I am haunted by the kiss you shouldn't have given me."" It sounds like Anakin is making an awkward pass at his sister.",0.16157407407407406,0.5523148148148147
"Ok now i love star wars, but this movie was bad. The dialoge was awful and Natalie Portman was very non-convincing as an actress. Lucas should not be directing these movies, he didnt direct the empire strikes back or return of the jedi, and those are the best in the seires. This movie went nowhere.

For all of you that voted 10, something is definetly wrong with you. Nothing about this film was good; not the directing, not the acting, not the editing, and and especially not the script. The only thing that could make Attack of the Clones worse would be casting Keanu Reeves as the lead. Well there is one good thing about this film...it is the funniest movie of the year.

"Expectations were high as Obi-Wan and baby Darth joined the assination investigation, but after Padmé and Anakin get together, the chemistry one would expect from these two characters never materialized.  I wanted Portman use what she learned from the professional and put a bullet in Hayden Christensen's head.  They mixed like ""oil and water"".  I believe it was more Hayden Christensen's fault rather than Anakin's fault.  Hayden Christensen CANNOT act.  Even when he gets angry, his facial expressions appear as if he has constipation rather than realizing that his mother just died in his arms.  The casting for this role poor, and as a result, the middle 1.2 hours of the movie was unbearable.  But, it did redeem itself slightly when Yoda took out his tool and went to town.  And, what's with Sam Jackson?  Don't get me wrong, he is a fine actor, but that goofy ""This party is over"" line, with a ghetto accent almost drove me over the edge.  Where did he get his Jedi training, South Central Jedi Tech?  I am a die hard Star Wars fan, but this movie sucked?

I had always assumed that this is what nerds who wore pocket protectors and spent Friday nights at home watched because they had nothing better to do. So when my family sat down and watched it, I tried to leave, but was ordered to sit down and suck it up. I was so glad that they did. This movie has made me consider George Lucas as a genius. It's action scenes are incredible, and even Yoda kicks ass in this movie. I especially enjoyed watching Padme and Anakin's romance blossom. While Hayden's acting was okay, I thought Natalie Portman charming as Amidala. It's made me go and buy all the series. So I'm, going to watch them all to get the whole story.

"A horrible, horrible movie. Badly written (a given with George Lucas), poorly acted (by everyone with the possible exception of Frank Oz),  and generally underwhelming. Hayden Christensen is embarrassing as Anakin. The action sequences are stupid, contrived, and laughable. The chase scene early in the movie with both Obi-Wan and Anakin making leaps of faith is just silly. There never seems to be any acknowledgment of the laws of physics -- momentum in particular seems to be regularly ignored.",-0.35595238095238096,0.6572802197802198
"Sure the acting is wooden, the dialogue weak, but Star Wars succeeds in the only area it needs to.  It is a spectacularly fun romp.  There are some cheesy one-liners that leave the movie-goers laughing.  People and critics tend to forget that the original Star Wars trilogy does not invoke memories of great acting or dialogue.  In fact, the acting in the first trilogy was attrotious, but it didn't matter.  The true star of any and all Star Wars films have been the special effects, the non-human actors.  This trilogy is missing the formidable villian that Darth Vader was in the first trilogy, but the torment that Anikan is having not over his feelings for Amidala but over his feelings of anger and frustration come across well enough to give that foreboding of doom that surrounds his character.  There is some zingy dialogue that foreshadows events that occur in the first trilogy, like when Obi-Wan tells his Padawan learner, Anakin -- well, you'll just have to see it.  I don't want to ruin one of the few dialogue moments in the movie. There are very few dialogue moments.  Obi-Wan has that one.  Mace has one later in the film as does Yoda.  Yoda is the best part of this film and his scenes along with the scenes involving Jango Fett and his clone son, Boba are among the best.  The climactic battle scene is so filled with energy that I feel that I must see the film again because I know I missed half of what was going on film. I wrote a review for Spider-Man not to long ago where I said that Spider-Man failed on the level that it needed to succeed in the action aspect. Spider-Man succeeds where Star Wars does not on a dialogue, acting level. If you combined the two you would have the perfect movie.  George Lucas is not an actor's director.  He gets better performances from his special effects than his actors.  That is the way he directs.  For that matter, who really cares?  The performances do not need to to be Laurence Olivier quality.  The best performance given by any actor in the whole series was by Alec Guiness and that's only because he's one of the finest actors that ever lived and did not need a whole lot of direction.  Young actors like Portman, McGregor, and Christensen need direction.  McGregor gave an outstanding performance in last year's Moulin Rouge.  Portman has been outstanding in various films.  These are not bad actors.  They just didn't get the direction they needed to fulfil their characters.  I'm still not sold on why Amidala would be in love with Christensen.  It would seem to me that she may be sort of sickened by his actions when going to save his mother.  My disbelief can be linked back to Episode I where it is difficult to imagine Portman's sexy Amidala with the young 9-year-old Anakin. Nevertheless, this is a great movie that doesn't rely too heavily on the love story the way Spider-Man did.  This movie relies on gun fights, chases, exploding starships, light saber duels, which includes one of the most unlikely duel of the series and one of the most satisfying.  I wouldn't dare to ruin it for anyone, so I won't. Bottom line, this film succeeds where it needs to and fails where it has never mattered before and still doesn't.  I mean, did anyone really go to see a Star Wars movie to find out if Han and Leia end up together.

"Though Lucas delivers eye-popping visuals and blood-racing action sequences, this movie has as many (though different) problems as The Phantom Menace. Any viewing audience should go in expecting the most trite and cliched love story imaginable and the sacrifice of a good story to the development of Anakin's character. Yes, one must account for the transformation of a seemingly well-meaning youth into the fearsome Darth Vader, but the love story subplot, riddled as it is with over-the-top declarations of the exquisite tortures of lover-hood, only emphasizes the challenges to immediacy that plague Christensen's acting. Though the plots starring McGregor have a redeeming quality, one must wonder if Christensen will replace the Jar-Jar around Lucas's neck. This isn't to say that the film isn't worth a viewing because it is, but I question that it is the successor that Star Wars fans have been patiently awaiting.",0.3153846153846154,0.5461538461538461

Although the FX are 2nd to none, and the fights, space battle and general pyrotechnics are superb, what this sorry mess of a movie lacks is a heart, a centre, someone about whom we can care. Cos God love him, not only has the Anakin character become a crashing bore, but Hayden Christiansen just cannot act. Not at all. Not one little bit. And he's more or less swallowed up by all the crash bang whizzery that surrounds him and his cohorts; Ewan Mc Gregor's Obi Wan is more dull and humourless than ever, Natalie Portman struggles gamefully with the terrible dialogue but in the end does all her emoting through her hair, and the various others involved (Samuel L and Christopher Lee especially) simply fax their performances in.

If loving AOTC makes me less of a fan, so be it.  The film is AMAZING.  There are at least half a dozen visually unparalleled scenes.  The plot blends just the right amount of adventure and intensity with subtle (or not-so-subtle) foreshadowing of episodes 4-6, and leaves the viewer drooling with anticipation for Episode III.

Why the attack of the Star Wars Geeks out there? Simple enough to answer. They can't just enjoy it anymore. Star Wars has become more than a wonderful series of highly entertaining movies. It has become more than religion to these fools with no lives. They live their lives as if they had family on Alderaan when it was blown up, as if they were nearly destroyed by the Death Star. As if Han Solo loved them, but for some reason fell in love with a hot princess. Get over yourselves, you geeks! Simply put, Episode II: Attack of the Clones, was a wonderful movie, with great special effects and a solid plotline.

The tie-in's from episode I and to the nostalgic trilogy were great.  The movie had very minor flaws and perhaps a few scenes we could have done without and even went overboard with some of the characters (ie. Yoda, C3P0) but watching Yoda doing his thing was a good laugh. I have always been a StarWars fan and I was a bit dissapointed with Epidode I but George Lucas is back to form with Epiode II.

Now that I've seen the movie I'd like to comment on two things: first of all the special effects in this movie; they are great - I've never seen anything like it before, the music also plays an important part i the perception of the special effects - the use of drum music, as can be heard in 'Crounching Tiger, Hiden Dragon' makes one of the Light Saber duels into something special. The other part that I wanted to comment is the dialogue - we were 600 people in the theater, all of us had was very excited, and all of us screamed one or two time because of the bad dialogue. The problem it seems, is that the dialogue feels too 'constructed' while this is good when you want to make trailers or punch lines that you want the audience to remember after leaving the theater, it is really bad when you are trying to show a love relationship or something like that.",0.2396318342151675,0.6069356261022927

"After a disappointing Phantom Menace I tried not to set my expectations too high this time. Which is just as well. For me the script was poor at times with too many cliches and for the first hour I found myself cringing at times in my seat. The love scene was too prolonged and downright corny. The most notable performance was Christopher Lee who was his usual excellent self. The highly talented Ewan McGregor seemed to be struggling converting his Scottish accent into an upper class English accent and Hayden Christensen looked as though he had been plucked from some mediocre amateur dramatic society to fill the role. Although he does have my sympathy as the lines he was given were not exactly inspirational. Having said all that the film did improve considerably in the second half. The battle scenes and special FX were superb which was to be expected. On balance this was a good light entertainment film well worth seeing and certainly a big improvement on it's predecessor. But unfortunately, Lucas again failed to achieve the exceptionally high standards expected of him. I awarded this film 7/10.

"It´s a cool movie, much more Star Wars than Episode I, including great fight scenes (especially Joda of course) and with the guys who designed the clone-army the best aliens I have ever seen in a movie. But from the first moment where Anakin appears George Lucas screams in your face: ""Watch out, this guy will become very evil"". The storyline offers so many possibilities to let the character of Anakin develop, but Lucas simply completely failed with this part of the movie, since Anakin does not develop at all: From the beginning he is arrogant and bigheaded. Together with completely primitive dialogs (""I should be the most powerful Jedi of all time!"") Anakins story simply destroys the good impression the rest of movie gives: If you take a look at his behavior, nobody can understand why Padme should love him at all and the moronic death of his mother makes you just shake your head. Not even the best actor could have made Anakins character and his story seem believable (because of the crappy script) and thus Hayden Christensen has not a chance to succeed. Does George Lucas think his audience only consists of idiots or why does he have to present Anakins tale so clearly that you feel insulted and without leaving room for any imagination. I will give this movie a 7, which regarding my harsh stricture shows how good many parts this movie has. But I am still disappointed because I know how good this movie could have been.

"SWEP2 is unlike any of the other SW films.  It's not really like any movie I can recall as far as the tone.  It's dark, brooding and at times pretty violent, with very few light moments.  But the light moments are much appreciated as a result.  I have no idea what everyone is complaining about, the acting is just fine in this movie - the dialogue in the love scenes is a bit  over-the-top at times (think teen romance, where a kiss is life-or-death), but the actors do fine across the board.  Not flat at all. Everything moves along briskly.  Even Jar-Jar is OK.  The only real complaint I would have is the CG is at times obvious.

The only, and I mean only, reason to watch this putrid piece of rotting wookie carcass of a movie is the fight scene with Yoda, but even then, the guy he fights is horrible, thus following the bad acting characteristics I was talking about before.

Jar Jar only had a few scenes, and played no real major role in the movie. Threepio served as the comic relief, just as it should be in Star Wars. Another thing, the love scene sounded so bad in reviews, but Lucas played it out so great that there was no real long sequence with just Anakin and Padme.

"Everybody knows whether they admit it or not (even the critics) that George Lucas saved American cinema from death by banality and boredom when he released his first Star Wars film and revolutionized the film industry. This installment rivals the original Star Wars in terms of innovation and excitement. It is a sweeping epic that will excite and entertain anyone who isn't brain dead or a professional movie critic (which often goes hand in hand, at least in the US). I've been to two showings and on both occasions the audience was clearly moved and everybody cheered throughout the movie. There was a huge roar of applause from people of all ages after the movie ended.  Some have criticized the acting but in my opinion that is absolutely ludicrous and has probably more to do with the fact that most of the actors are not from the USA than their talent. Hayden IS Anakin Skywalker just as Harrison Ford was Han Solo and its impossible to imagine anyone else taking their place. Ewan and Natalie play their roles well and Samuel Jackson and Christopher Lee are brilliant. I fear many of the critics that have given this movie a negative review have alternate motifs. We must bear in mind that Lucas is not a part of the Hollywood fluff machine circle that the critics move in and churns out one brainless and badly acted move after another to critical acclaim. It is interesting that in Europe AOTC has received overwhelmingly positive reports.",0.10372200263504612,0.49038208168642955

Because there will be no mystery, ""Luke, I'm your father"" who cares, ""Leia you're my sister"", already knew that. The prequels give it away. 2. This didn't just occur to me but, the effects are good, but lack the warmth of the originals. 3. The dialogue and characters also lack the charm of the originals, and dialogue is painful at times. 4. I don't like comparisons between LotR's and Star Wars, but... The new movies don't compare to LotR for feeling, charm, and energy. The Originals stand beside LotR's as two great cinematic sagas. But the new Star Wars movies are just their aspiring stable boys. 5. If you really want to get more out of the Star Wars universe, beyond the original trilogy. Then read some of the books. It's sad but authors like Kevin J. Anderson have done better by the original story than George Lucas's new attempts.

"The Force is back with George Lucas, without a doubt! Ewan McGregor is hilarious as a more sarcastic Obi-Wan Kenobi this time as he tries to tolerate and instruct his arrogant and somewhat whiney apprentice Anakin, played in a mixed performance by Hayden Christiansen. Hayden does quite well in the second half of the film, but he falls short in the first half with some very cardboard lines and some pretty fake emotions. However, after one encounter on Tatooine, everything changes and we see the anger in Anakin. That's what we've been waiting for, and Hayden delivers. Natalie Portman, finally free from some of her awful dialogue, is handed a somewhat more palatable script, but she still has some clunkers to deliver. However, she is given a much sexier and personality and wardrobe this time around, and manages to balance the diplomatic side of Padme with the take-charge fighter. The effects are unbelievable, the lightsaber fights(while not as elaborate as in Menace) will leave you cheering, and the villains Jango Fett and Count Dooku ooze malice.

"Okay to start this off, I just want to state the fact that I am one of the biggest Star Wars fanatics in the world. Star Wars is less of a movie and more like a religion to me. So when Episode I ended (and slightly disappointed, but I understood it was just a start), I began the three year anticipation for Episode II. Thankfully, the anticipation was WELL WORTH IT. I consider Episode II not only to be a great Star Wars movie...but (some may say I'm wrong) I consider it to be my second favorite in the series (sandwiched by #1 Empire, and #3 ROTJ). Episode II starts off with a big bang, literally. When there is an attempt on Senator Amidala's (Natalie Portman) life, the Jedi Council assigns Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) to protect the headstrong senator. Lo and behold, Obi-wan arrives with his padawan, a 20 year old Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). From the offset you can see that Hayden tackles the role very well, bringing a depth that Episode I lacked. The Jedi have a mandate that states they must protect the queen, but in doing so they pursue her assassin. I won't spoil, but suffice to say, the pursuit leads them into deeper...and darker, things. So what everyone wants to know: Is this movie less one dimensional than Episode I? YES. It has everything that Episode I had (EXCEPT JAR JAR, HE ONLY SHOWS UP FOR ALL OF 10 MINUTES-GOOD STUFF), knockout special effects, incredible lightsaber fights (Let's just say that an little green Jedi master fights), great action sequences(Great Clone War sequence). But it also took a note from Empire and built on subtle underplots and love themes. Anakins transgression to the Dark side pops up in Episode II...but wait till Episode III for the full transformation. This movie did not disappoint this Star Wars junkie at all. The Force is strong with Lucas and his team once again. I'm very happy to be a fan of the greatest movies of all time. So to sum it all up...go see Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. It's more than worthy of your time. Whereas Episode I was all killer,no filler; Episode II is a Pie of buttkicking.",0.2232142857142857,0.5399385560675883

"WARNING: SPOILERS Wow.  No other word can describe the feeling you get after seeing this movie and letting everything sink in.  Yoda is the greatest of all Jedi, and he shows it in his duel with Darth Tyrannus.  The story was great.  I'm not much for love stories, but this one just worked.  It gave more emotion to the execution scene, and to the movie in general.  It sets up Episode 3 so perfectly.  Though I didn't like the character Anakin, you really aren't supposed to, Hayden did an amazing job.  As did all the other actors.  I dislike the fact Jango was killed...but when Boba picks up his helmet, a chill runs down your spine.  One thing that bothers me slightly, is the fact that Tyrannus defeats Obi-Wan, Anakin, and then basically ties with Yoda. I know Anakin is not matured yet, but he is still supposed to be the chosen one, and Yoda is the most powerful of all Jedi.  At any rate, this movie could not have been done any better.  The war scene was great, special effects were incredible, John Williams yet again does a great job with the soundtrack, and in my opinion, Lucas redeemed himself from the Episode 1 failure.  I liked Phantom Menace, but I'm glad he cut Jar Jar Binks down to about 3 lines and 2 minutes of total time on-film.  See this movie if your a fan of Star Wars, or just a fan of great films.

"After seeing this movie the opening day (wow I feel like a trekkie...), I must admit that it definitely does not disappoint. I won't give away any key elements of the story, but I'll give a few points on why I believe that it was one of the best Star Wars movies. First off, this one, unlike Episode 1, had an interesting plot. There was lots of action, and enough inaction to balance it out. The Anakin/Padme issue actually added to the movie, as opposed to making it worse and bogging it down. Another point I'd like to make, is that this movie had some wonderful puns and inside humor that Episode 1 sorely lacked. It was enough to keep the audience laughing in some parts, which is almost unheard of for a Science Fiction movie. My third point, is that the visual effects and new races were simply stunning. These are some of the best special effects I've ever seen. To make my last point, I have merely one word: Yoda.

Don't get me wrong, it is necessary for later plot developments, I just found it a little weakly constructed.

"Ah... relief.  After a somewhat disappointing Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones was superb.  The plot revealed several connections to the first trilogy that I often wondered about.  Yoda's fight scene was simply astounding.  The only real question that was brought to mind was ""Why is Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) the only Jedi with a purple-hued lightsaber?"" I did not see it in Digital format yet, but look forward to do so sometime in the next few weeks.  If you have not seen this... WATCH IT!",0.10909090909090909,0.4939393939393939

"This is by far superior to episode 1 and in my opinion just as good as return of the jedi however it does not live up to the empire strikes back. Jar-Jar Binks has a much smaller role in e2, even so people booed at his every appearence at the screening i saw. The tedious part part of the movie is in the numerous drawn out love scenes with flat lines and flatter acting by Hayden. My other complaint would be that Obi-Wan seems a little weak in the movie, easily getting captured and putting up almost no resistence to Count Dooku. However the shortcomings of the film are made up with a cooler than ever jedi battle royale with an army of droids and Samuel L Jackson triumphantly chopping off the head of his foe. However the coup de ta comes when we finally get to see Yoda kick some Dooku but, and exclaim ""You have much to learn!"" The ticket price is worth it just for this scene alone.

"What can I say about this movie, other than it was all that a fan could hope to be.  Unlike the Phantom Menace, in AOTC we get to learn about the personalities of the characters.  The opening sequence is incredible, and the plot is strong enough to carry the entire two hours plus.  The romance parts may see a little sappy, but they are necessary.  Hayden does a great job portraying Anakin's emotional character, and he is really believable as the boy who will be Vader.  Obi-Wan becomes a more likeable, and often humorous figure, who is by far the most entertaining person in the movie. The end battle scene is of course all it's been hyped up to be, but there are some major twists and a few startling surprises.  It definitely follows the structure of Empire Strikes Back, all the way to the final scene.

The last 20 minutes of the movie were the best and Yoda really kicked butt! However, this 2 hour movie could have been down.  Half way through the movie my kids wanted to leave.  Maybe my view is clouded because we watched Spider-Man recently and it was sooooo wonderful!!!!

What a movie .... I would have to say by far the most action Star Wars yet. Many people said that it was going to be a lame movie just like Episode 1 but it was the totally opposite. The best by far was the final battle scene bewteen Duku and Yoda. He doesnt need his cane when he is flying around and using a light saber but he does when he just walking  But over all I give it a 9.

"The Star Wars franchise is getting back on track, and Lucas is starting to get some of his old magic. I went to see this movie as soon as I could, because I was anticipating it so much, and I got what I expected. Note, I did not expect anything as good as the first trilogy. The plot was as strong as the first trilogy, and the acting was great (Hayden Cristensen does an excellent job, you can almost feel this dark energy flowing from him), but it seems that Lucas has lost his flair for dialogue and the love story seemed a little predictable and cheesy. The action scenes, however, more than made up for this. (I really got a kick out of the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Yoda stuff) This is not a love story, but it is a great action movie, and probably the best Star Wars ""date"" movie you could take someone to.

The end ""battle"" was very good and seehing Yoda with a Lightsabre was hilarious.  But then when it started to get good the film just died off and ended without any thought provoking finale or any hint about Anakin's darkside.  It just ended!  I also thought that Hayden I dunno how to spell his last name I just won't bother, his acting was horrid. Jeez this guy makes Jake Lloyd look like Tom Hanks for crying out loud!  He whines and whines and in the end I only was amused when I saw Padme` dress in another sexy costume.  I'm not going to bitch anymore, just see it. Samuel L.

Its a love story, its an action film and its a Star Wars film finally. With new worlds, new societies and exotic characters.  The evil Count Dooku is more than a match for Darth Maul as a true movie villian.  While Jango Fett is amazing as the hired gun. This is a must see.",0.19787878787878788,0.6103598484848485

"This movie is awesome!!!!!!  I know this is rated PG movie-but damn! This movie was intense. I'm glad all the kiddie crap is gone from TPM and ROTJ. I have a message for all the critics who bash this movie-What the hell are you guys looking for? This is just a fun movie which will be loved by fans. Was Mark Hamill that great when he cried in ANH because he couldn't hang out with his friends. The acting in the OT was not very good. How many times does Leia say, "" Let's get out of here"" in ROTJ. IN ESB- the dialogue seems forced- ""who's scruffy looking""or ""A death mark is not an easy thing to live with"". The dialogue in AOTC is no different than the previous films. Granted, I do feel ESB is the best of them all. I think critics blast this film because their not Star Wars fans. I told my wife- I think Star Wars fans will love this film: Critics will hate it because they don't focus on the big six part picture. I swear these critics try to find something to rip because Star Wars is not artistic. I bet if SW consisted of avant -garde Clone-troopers or a gay anakin skywalker they'd like it. Most of them are too grown up to enjoy Star Wars. Last Night I felt like a little kid. That's what these movies are all about.

"As a loyalist to Star Wars, I have nothing but great remarks for the movie. Nonetheless, I will try to make an objective critic of the movie without giving away details.  First, this movie has more action sequences than any other Star Wars film; incredibly action packed.  The movie puts you on your feet with the opening chase sequence, and then settles you down telling the love story between Anakin and Padme, then you're strapped on a rocket and away you go.  This movie is the link between Episode I and the older Trilogy we respect so well. Not to get into detail, but it starts to show how Anakin will take down the Dark Side and how the human Anakin starts to become the mechanical Vader.  It shows how Bobba Fett will begin to follow in his fathers steps.  How Luke Skwalker ends up with his Uncle Owen Lars and even when plans of the Death Star begin.  All these things come into play. Lucas did a marvelous job with the story, which is what Star Wars has always been about.  In the midst of the story, Lucas throws in some hardcore battle sequences unlike nothing ever seen.  The ending leaves you waiting for the third film.  I am not on the academy award staff, but there were some one liners that did not seem to belong in the film as far as dialogue.  But when you look at it, those are the little things that are in all films.  These professional critics are hell bent on trashing movies because there were clichés in the movie.  What movie doesn't have clichés?  In all, Star Wars has never targeted audiences for Best Actor, Best Actress categories, it has always been about telling the story.  Ask yourself, why did you go see Star Wars?  You went because you want to finish learning about the story or you went because it's going to be an action packed movie with special affects. You did not go because you wanted to see how well some new actor said `I love you'.",0.24735675204425203,0.3831424362674362

"Before I saw Episode II I didn't have  extremely high hopes for enjoying this movie. That was because of the negative reviews written by nonsensical people such as Roger Ebert who wrote the absolute worst review I've ever read of this movie and every other movie up to this point. By worst meaning not making any !@#$%&* sense at all except the part in his review where hacks at the dialogue which to a certain degree I do agree with. He also said the images were fuzzy or something to that effect(maybe he was eating from his super-sized popcorn tub and occasionally glancing up at the screen so fast the images seemed blurry.) He claimed it was the digital effect on a giant screen where there wasn't a digital projection. He also mentioned the actors were stiff and seemed like they were chanting there lines, which brings me to this question; how could Ebert write a negative review about a smashing sequel to a crappy ass movie and say that stupid movie was good which it wasn't!!??? (If you have not guessed what that movie was just think Jar Jar Binks who gets his head cut off by a Jedi's lightsaber in this movie[off camera though :( ] Why did he give two stars to Clones(which was a far better film than TPM) and give Menace three and a half stars. Episode I had crappy dialogue, flat wooden actors, and long boring political talking sequences. These are all things that Ebert claims occurred in Episode II. The ironic thing however is that almost everything that was crappy and disappointing in TPM is improved in AOTC, not to mention it is more like the original trilogy. And yet he only gave it two stars. WHY!!!!!!!!! Roeper thought the opposite about the movie and thought it was great, and.........the best of the five movies!! Roger your film criticizing counterpart is smarter than you are sometimes it seems. Overall AOTC is MUCH better than TPM. I don't know what all those crack heads were smoking when they were writing those negative reviews about this film. Don't we see these movies to have fun?, by the why Yoda has the best fight scene in the entire series in this!

"To say Star Wars The Phantom Menace was a box Office smash hit would be an understatement, but to say it left only a few Star Wars fans disappointed would be a understatement as well. the Phantom menace was heavily criticised for the Disneyesque Story style and wooden characters (the less said about the annoying Jar Jar binks the better) and with movies like the Lord of the Rings and the Matrix challenging Star Wars for the title of Movie epic it seemed like the Star Wars franchise was under threat for a moment. Thankfully Star Wars: The Attack of the Clones shows George Lucas hasn¹t lost his touch,  the movie is a special effects feast, beyond anything we seen recently, mixed with plenty of battle sequences and a love story on the side. For all you non Jedi fans, a quick re cap. Episode two of the Star Wars series deals with the gradual transformation of young Anakin Skywalker, to the Dark Side of the mystical Force and turning to the evil Darth Vader. Episode two starts ten years after the The Phantom Menace,  the old Galactic Republic is going through a time of political turmoil with the danger of a civil war looming. The defenders of the old order the Jedi Knights are increasingly over stretched and opposition in the Senate (led  by Senator Amidala played by Natalie Portman) has blocked plans to make a grand Army to crush the separatists led by Count Dooku (played by Christopher Lee a Desi connection here, he played Quaid e Azam in the Movie Jinnah!). The political backdrop, with the gradual decay of the old order, the contempt for politicians, and the intent of the ruler to gradually increase his power, through emergency powers is something we often see happening in the World. Ewan Mgregor reprises his role as Obi Won Kenobi with the usual stoicism and the growing rift between him and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker played by Hayden Christenson. Hayden comes of well as an increasingly angry and bitter Anakin who has little time for the patient approach of the Jedi order. Samuel Jackson returns as Jedi Knight Mace Windau, happily in a bigger role than last time, watch out for his spectacular show down with Bounty hunter Jango Fett. Another high point is the light sabre duel between Count Dooku and Yoda. I do have a few complaints, unlike the original trilogy, there is little chemistry between the characters, Anakin and Amidala and the whole love story seems a bit contrived. Another problem is the sheer number of sub plots, it tends to distract from the characters. Despite the criticism, this is a good family movie and sets a build up for (what should be a dark) finale.",0.01562786596119929,0.4629700176366842
"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones was pretty much what I expected.  I wasn't really looking forward to going to this one since I had been disappointed by the ""re-makes"" of episodes IV, V, and VI.  (So-called improvements to IV, V, and VI failed to eliminate artifacts and visual flaws in scenes with star patterns for example.  In those re-makes I had expected technical adaptations, not character additions).  But with Episode II - Attack of the Clones, I could not detect such imperfections (short of the tape change markers).  In my opinion, the continuity to the story could have been better; there seemed to be some jumping around from one set of characters to another.  The fact that the story takes place before episode VI limits the parameters to the extent that there was little room for expanding the story itself.  In my opinion, the movies should have begun from episode I instead of episode VI.  In any case, I managed to sit through much of the movie with some level of patience.  About the last 20 minutes contained most of the action which was (in my opinion) somewhat predictable. I emphasize somewhat.  Perhaps I would have enjoyed Attack of the Clones if I were 16 again, but I would have preferred to see it on DVD & on my 70"" TV. When the movie was over, there was NO APPLAUSE.

"Although i am not one of these fans who knows by heart every actor's performance in any of the five episodes already seen, i would like to add some comments. Too much use of the computer in the making of the film turns it into a semi video-game. The original three episodes were more authentic since they were filmed with less technical devices but the results were amazing. There are scenes in the attack of the clones in which you can easily realize how this or that creature is a virtual one and it is not very well mixed with the real environment. On  the other hand the actor who plays Anakin is a very bad one. Maybe he is too young or it was his first time. He is not very convincing in this role. The guy of the phantom menace was great at playing young Anakin. I loved The Phantom menace and i almost disliked episode ii. Even the love story between Amidala and Anakin does not make it better. In the story plot there is one point i consider quite original. The fact of making the audience understand that what takes Anakin to the dark side is his rebellion against Jedi's principles. But this rebellion is based on his love to his mother and Amidala. Does this mean that to be a good Jedi one  has to say no to life?. Are they priests? Who is in the dark side then? This seems quite good to me. I am willing to see what is going on.",0.19922863247863246,0.537724358974359

The music that told us who was a Sith in Episode I is present as well. We can view it as sort of a musical evolution, because the music of Episode I is making way for the music in the Trilogy, through Episode II and will probably do the same in Episode III.",0.23492063492063492,0.38571428571428573

"I was a big fan of the Star Wars movies until I saw Attack of the Clones. The Phantom Menace had great action and special effects which barely managed to make up for the dreadful acting. In Attack of the Clones the action scenes were all that kept me from falling asleep during this dreadful movie. The plot was hard to follow and it kept coming back to terribly acted scenes where all you wanted to do was strangle one of the lead characters to get them to shut up. One of the ultimate worst lines goes like this, ""I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life."" To say this line is spoken in a monotone is giving it too much credit. All the lines are spoken in this same fashion and I found it difficult not to turn it off. As I said before, the only reason I didn't turn it off was to see the action scenes which were quite impressive. Ewan Macgregor who plays Obi-Wan should be recognized as the only person in the movie who can act. The strange thing is all the other actors, such as Natalie Portman and Samuel L Jackson, have proved their acting skills in other movies. Is George Lucas to blame? I don't know.

"A darker tone than in Episode I and a more serious note (all those who hated Jar Jar and cute little Ani will be pleased) makes for a step very much in the right direction compared to the messy kiddy movie  that was Episode I. The characters benefit from a deeper profile and a fuller content in terms of a story (although not yet close to the consistent and easily followed storyline of episodes IV - VI) that does a credible job of teeing up the evolution of the character of young Anakin Skywalker and providing additional background to the rise of the empire. The movie does however suffer from sub standard acting performances by almost all parties involved (with the exception of a brilliant Christopher Lee), but on the other hand it's Star Wars, who cares?  Fantastic effects and camera work as usual, but the good Mr. Lucas is becoming too smitten with the possibilities offered by digital imagery. Every shot is overloaded. Overall not bad, and certainly provides faith that Episode three could be just right.",0.17435439560439558,0.5190201465201465

I will admit, there are still a number of instances where the dialogue could have been written better, or simply omitted altogether, but Star Wars fans don't love these movies for the dialogue.  We get to see lots of action, and it really feels like Lucas wrote this movie for the fans of the series, unlike Episode I.

You probably have to see this film more than once to catch it all.  I might have a different point of view after another viewing.

Do we REALLY need to hear him say ""The Dark Lord"" in the middle of a Star Wars movie after just seeing him in LOTR? If you have any knowledge of LOTR, those words coming out of Christopher Lee's mouth right away take you out of the movie experience and give you a chance to stretch your muscles as you roll your eyes. His storyline was great and could have been brilliant - if not for the weak dialogue - especially the part where he might as well have come to center stage and said, ""And now, audience, you will see the much anticipated and highly ridiculous light sabre battle between Yoda and myself.""  Don't introduce a battle, just get to it.  Back to the comment about the battle being ridiculous - Yoda reminded me of a green Sonic the Hedgehog with all the hopping and spinning.  I thought this was supposed to be one hell of a battle. The people in the theatre with me were all either laughing or crying.

"Attack of the Clones reveals how beautifully complex the star wars saga is. There is a whole level of complexity that the original three movies lack, and this movie delivers completely.  It is obvious why Lucas waited to do the first three episodes.  The  intricate battles and sequences in episode II would have been impossible to do with the limited special effects they had, nor would a new audience be as appreciative of the significance of the actions that happen in episode II.  Knowing what will eventually happen attaches so much significance and awe to the actions in Episode II.  Lucas delivers but he also leaves plenty of mystery with episode III.  We STILL do not know what will happen.  This movie reveals the most information out of any movie before it, but at the same time becomes the most personal.  We care about the characters because they are people not because they are heroes in a movie.

"I would give it 1 star but for the excellent visuals, the performance of Christopher Lee and the interesting plot as it relates to Episode I. Otherwise, the acting was mostly horrible (although I'm pretty sure it was due to the ridiculous lines), the editing was poorly done, which caused the whole film to bog down, even during the ""climactic"" final 30 minutes, there was very little humor and what was there was so poorly done as to cause me to cringe and of course there was the PG rating.  George Lucas seems to have a big fear of losing the very young audience, but by dumbing down this and the last Star Wars films, he totally shuts out the now grown up fans of the first three films.  I hope George doesn't plan to write and direct Episode III, which should be the darkest of all six of them, because he will probably turn it into a childish ""adventure.""

"The New Star Wars films present us with a saga that will last a lunchtime. Episode I was filmed in 20 minutes, Episode II took even longer. Every blunder George Lucas made in The Phantom Menace he did away with in the Clone Wars, so to make room for all new blunders.  The movie is action packed, it is so action packed that one tends to forget the plot, as well as the action.  The movie opens with Anakin, who is now a teenager who's primary interests are girls, video games, and punk metal, and his mentor Obi Wan Kenobi chasing an assassin through the Red Light District of A Galaxy far, far away.  I first saw this chase scene in the movie theater, and about 15 minutes into it people were heard asking ""Does anyone know what this is about?""  They still had no answer at the end. After this, Anakin is assigned to transport Senator Natalie Portman to another, safer area.  When Portman first appears she is wearing a lot of clothes, and a weird hat, but the audience need not worry: By the end of the movie she will look more like Britney Spears. Meanwhile, Obi Wan Kanobi finds out that Mr. Fett (the father of Boba Fett, who's first appearance was in the second Star Wars film-- A STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL-- though he was far more prominent in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK) is building an army of clones for some reason which apparently was too important. So far, sounds better than Episode I, right?  Well don't worry, JAR JAR BINKS IS BACK!!! And better than ever!  But I won't tell how, because this is too important a plot point to spoil. What really amazes me about this movie, though, is that it is far more violent than I'd like to see Star Wars be.  It involved more than just the innocent fights of the original Star Wars, this time we get to see people get their heads bitten off and such.  Unlike the Trilogy, I would not take little children to see this movie. But this can't surprise us.  George Lucas had almost 20 years to think of a way to make a round peg fit a square hole (Which is what he is doing--- trying to create a prequel to something that was not meant to have a prequel), but instead he gives us nonsense. If you're looking for a good movie to make out with a date during, I reccomend Star Wars  Episode II:  The Clone Wars, because you won't be missing anything.",0.1658279220779221,0.48549783549783543

"As an original moviegoer to Episode IV way back in '77 and all the episodes thereafter, I had mixed feelings about this latest installment in the Star Wars saga.  My views can be either attributed to my age showing or maybe the wisdom that comes with age. The opening scenes needed a little more action.  One of the higher points in The Phantom Menace was the opening droid battle with the familiar Star Wars theme pumping in the background and the flashy new Jedi moves.  There was nothing in AOTC until the speeder chase scene, which I felt, came too late and could have been shorter.  I also found Anikins outbursts and undisciplined manners hard to swallow.  For someone who has been training as a Jedi Knight for ten years you would think that discipline would be taught before swordsmanship or use of the force.  At times, he acts more like a preschooler than a twenty year old.  Then came the love story.  A necessity for future episodes but sadly underwritten.  I believe both Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen are superb actors but have nothing to work with here. The scene with Anikins mother at the Tusken Raider camp is in my opinion the most important scene in the film.  Anikins turning to the dark-side really begins here.  Haydens evil `Jack Nicholson look' is perfect and creepy!  I could feel the dark-side just by looking at him!  Again we are cheated though.  This scene is just a crumb of what it should have been. Although the Jango Fett scenes were very cool they were not needed.  I think that Lucas added the character because Boba was so well liked in the other episodes.  Boba really didn't have that big of a role in the other episodes to warrant anymore screen time UNLESS something still lies ahead in Episode III.  Finally, during the last half hour we get a bombardment of what Lucas does best.  The Jedi battles are superb!  I almost started crying like a newly crowned Miss America during the final showdown with Yoda and Dooku! AWSOME!!  To sum it up, the movie starts at a medium pace, slows to a crawl, and then jumps into lightspeed.  Although the last action packed scenes are the best in any Star Wars film to date the movie as a whole ranks in last place in the saga so far.",0.15327486824769435,0.5095092226613966

"Part of the expectation arisen around Episode II..., is owed to the love story between Anakin and Padmé.  But lamentably, this ingredient of the movie had a so careless processing, that are the texts of the dialogues of the scenes of love, the ones that spoil all the assembly of the movie.  The lines said between Anakin and Padmé since their arrival to the Naboo lake retreat, until their arrival to Geonosis' execution arena, signified an attack for more than one spectator willing to become detractor of the movie. And to think that who did the roles of Anakin and Padmé were destroyed for their work in Episode II...! Their critics forgot that good actors or actresses do not supply what lacks in the script. To us (the spectators) remains the doubt of if we lost of something that remained in the editing room, or we owe to the scriptwriter the do not to have worked better the love scenes as was done with almost all the other ingredients of the movie.",0.32083333333333336,0.6027777777777777

I didn't think 3-PO was all that funny, but as a forced comic-relief character he wasn't nearly as annoying as Jar Jar.

"I see mostly bad reviews for this latest installment of Star Wars, and I wonder, why? First, I say read the book. I have never seen a movie that was better then the book. The book would probably make much more sense to people than the movie, and eliminate many of these stupid postings from people who can't think. Most of the negative reviews talk about the story not making sense, being too complicated, or too dull. I ask how can this be complicated for anyone over the age of three? Naturally, what follows is my interpretation of events and may not be entirely accurate. Ten years before, around the time of The Phantom Menace Palpatine/Darth Sidious arranged for the creation of the clone army. I know they mention Sifo-Dyas as arranging it, but that could be Sidious/Palpatine or Dooku/Tyranus. The Dark Side of the force kept Yoda and Mace Windu from knowing of its creation, implying a connection. In addition, Jango Fett says `a man called Tyranus' (Count Dooku) recruited him. After the clone army was in creation Palpatine arranged the Separatist movement to create need for the army. The need for the army led to the senate's decision to give Palpatine extra powers. Powers which he claims he'll `lay down when this crises has abated.' This puts him in the position to name himself emperor, which he will probably do in Episode III as the empire is already in place in IV. Many people say at least this was better than Episode I, but I don't think Episode I was as bad as people say. In fact, and right after I say this many people will no doubt think I'm an idiot and stop reading immediately, I think Episode I was better then the first three, but not as good as II. The reason I have for this is IV, V, and VI have an unfinished feel about them. There is almost no mention of anything that happens in the first three aside from one reference to the clone wars, the one mention of Luke and Leia's mother and a few mentions of their father and is turn to the Dark Side. They just seem more complete. Naturally, there couldn't be mentions because they didn't exist yet, but you should get what I'm saying. Episode I sets the stage. For anyone who wasn't and isn't bright enough to understand, the major event in Episode I was the electing of Palpatine to Supreme Chancellor. Never mind the Trade Federation's defeat at Naboo or Jar Jar Binks (Side note: listening to everyone talk how annoying he is and how much they hate him and want to kill him is worse then Jar Jar himself) the main thing was Palpatine. Ah, now to the romance or lack thereof between Anakin and Amidala. Again, I say read the book. From the book to the movie about three-fourths of the scenes with them were cut out, making it seem like she was with him 5 minutes then started to love him. They removed when they have dinner with her family, and she admits to her sister Sola that she is starting to fall for him. A minor thing I only saw once or twice was someone saying Anakin was basically good-hearted and that they couldn't see how he would turn into Darth Vader. I ask, did you even see the part where he slaughters all the Tuskin Raiders? He lost control and let his hate rule. He killed the women and children. That's pretty bad. This is another guess of mine but I think it is pretty fair. What if he lost the person he loves? Now we know that Amidala has Luke and Leia and even that she had to live for a while after having them because in VI Leia recalled her mother as being beautiful but always sad. Now, Anakin/Vader didn't know of his kids, showing he was not with her when she had them, probably because he was Vader, and Anakin no longer. The question, what would turn him to the Dark Side? My guess is he believes Amidala was killed, then in his anger turns to the Dark Side, with help from Palpatine of course. Once he has turned, Amidala goes into hiding because there's nothing she can do to turn him back, has the kids then is killed somehow. After all, I really can't see how someone could turn to the Dark Side if the person they love is right beside them.",0.013688256188256202,0.5142612942612942

"Like any Star Wars fan that grew up with the original trilogy, I looked forward to Episode II with a great deal of excitement, and I must say, having seen it now 5 times and having had many opportunities to digest its pros and cons, that it really quite extraordinary. As with anything that has such hype and historical success attached, viewer can't wait to tear it to pieces. After all, initially people complained about the title. For God's sake, was the titleThe Empire Strikes Back so inspiring, Return of the Jedi something special? And what does the title title matter anyways? After my first viewing, my initial feeling was wow!! What degree of imagination, design, craft and sheer graft must have gone in to creating such a movie? it is probably the closest to George Lucas' far away galaxy that we've yet seen. The characters, far-away-worlds and their applicable religons or beliefs are phenonmenal. And to think that this has all been brought forth from the in of one man is even moreso. If nothing more, George Lucas deserves praise for his vision and perseverance. As for the movie, sure it has it's faults. But what film doesn't? Some of the dialogue is a bit clumsy, but don't forget that it is designed to appeal to all ages. It's not Shakespeare and it's not Rugrats and neither is it meant to be. The enduring success of Star Wars is its universal appeal - and that may mean simplification, particularly where speech is concerned. The story is superb, especially when wee links to the original trilogy are thrown in. I particularly enjoyed Obi Wan's remark: ""You'll be the death of me"". Visually, the film is astonishing! The cityscape of Coruscant, the damp Kamino and the mysterious Geonosis all look fabulous. The action scenes including the early changeling chase, the Obi-Wan and Jango Fett battle and the always anticipated lightsabre showdowns were amazing. The performances were so-so. I can't still quite get used to Ewan McGregor's ""Guinness"" accent, Natalie Portman seemed a little bland while Hayden Christensen was good. For me though, the presence of Christopher Lee made all the difference. His brief scene with McGregor clearly showed the difference between ""master"" and ""apprentice"" in the acting stakes. As a fan I was thrilled. Whether you are a fan or not, cut the film some slack. Sure, note it's shortcomings, but recognise its merits, as there are many.

"Yes, the dialogue is boring and very flat.  Yes, Jar-Jar Stinks has some speaking parts (only a few thank God).  And YES this thing ROCKS!  As someone who saw the original Star Wars in 1977 on opening weekend at the age of 7 and was forever altered, Attack of the Clones may very well be the best one yet.  I think all Star Wars fans like each of the movies in different ways.  The original will always be the best because it was the first.  But Clones is definately the most beautiful and breathtaking of them all.  The dialogue sucks, but hey, it does in all of them, even the first three, just watch them again and see.  It doesn't help that there is no Harrison Ford to help out the lame script, but at least Jar-Jar is kept to a minimum.  But in Clones a lot of the fun is just watching how everything is tied together. The other fun comes in watching all of the action, much more than I thought was supposed to be in this one.  All in all, I'd put this one as my second favorite right above Empire Strikes Back, then Return of the Jedi, and lastly The Phantom Menace.",0.15594047619047618,0.44855158730158723
"A spectacular film that recaptured the magic of the first two episodes. When talking about the quality of a Star Wars film, it is only proper to evaluate within the context of the series.  That being said, this film is easily the equivalent of each of its predecessors.  The acting, which is being panned by many major critics, was as strong as that of any other Star Wars episode.  The story was more intriguing and more enveloping than any Star Wars film to date, and the both the sound and visuals were amazing.",0.3096354166666667,0.5609375000000001

My issue with this film is that while the spectacle - the effects, the sets, the costumes, are superb - someone forgot to write a decent script.

"Despite being a huge Star Wars fan, i really didn't expect too much out of this film. I was praying that it would be better than the Phantom Menace, and my prayers were definately answered. Watching Attack of the Clones reminded me of what a true Star Wars film was all about, a perfect blend of a story of love and incredible action sequences. I was concerned about the casting of Hayden Christenson as Anakin Skywalker, but i was wrong about him. He was amazing in this role. He was the perfect actor to show the signs of Evil in the man that would later become Darth Vader. When the movie ended at around 2:30 in the morning on Thursday, the first thing that entered my head was how great it was to see that George Lucas could still make a great film. I can't wait for Episode 3 when Anakin makes the transition from a life of peace in the Jedi Order to becoming the Evil Lord Vader.

It also has a great sense of adventure like the original ones along with multiple story lines also like Empire. The sound track was the best I've ever heard and the score great with a few new themes along with all the good old ones. I hated EP1, but this one I will definitely go see again and again and again. It does have a few weak point on the acting especially Hayden Christensen is not always too believable, but hey - he's a Skywalker - being a bad actor must run in the family.

"George Lucas seems to have gotten lost somewhere in his life's journey between the original Star Wars in 1977 and the release of the Phanom Menace in 1999.  Attack of the Clones confirms it.  That is not to say that Attack of the Clones is a bad film, it is not, however the prequal trilogy seems to be entirely out of sync with the original films.  I may be in the minority but I feel that CGI effects do not look real, in fact they usually don't even look good when used in excess, which Lucas seems to enjoy doing.  I long for the ggod ole' days when filmakers relied on miniatures, matte paintings and models rather than filming everything in front of a blue screen and adding things in later.  What results are films that seem as two visual layers that do not work together. That being said, Attack of the Clones is a good Star Wars movie not a great one.  I am hoping that Lucas finally finds his footing with Episode III and makes a movie worthy of the original trilogy.  The first hour and 15 mins. or so of this film are bogged down by scenes that are too long and the development of a love story that is flat and unconvincing.  Yet somehow by the end, perhaps because of our knowledge of what is to come, Annakin and Padme do seem to be genuinely in love.  Portman is better here than in Phantom Menace, Christiansen gives Annakin some depth that was lacking in Phantom Menace and has the perfect face for the part.  In one instant he can seem heroic and loving and in the next we can get a hint of Vader within him.  The rest of the cast is good for what they have to do.  Ewan McGregor has more to do in this movie, but still lacks the depth that Alec Guiness brought to the character.  Christopher Lee is great in the few moments he is on screen and Yoda...Yoda is at the top of his game.  He is entirely digital, which looked better than I thought it would.  But his lightsaber duel with Lee's Count Dooku near the end made the movie for me and mroe than made up for the listless pacing of the first half of the movie.  In fact I would go so far to say that this scene was one of the best of the trilogy. But the good parts do not gel together and the whole movie does not eminate the word ""Classic"" like the original trilogy.  But I have a feeling that when all six movies are seen together it will all come together and even the Phantom Menace's detractors may change their opinion about that movie.",0.22984633569739948,0.4887706855791962

The characters are very well developed this time around (and more good news, minimal Jar Jar). The main story in the production of it all was new comer Hayden Christensen who did a very good job with the evil building up in Anakin but not so good on the love for his mother and contempt for Obi-Wan (but maybe I'm just jealous because I didn't get picked for the part). Like the originals the comedy comes in the form of droids. The banter between C3PO and R2D2 was one of the things that made the originals so great and it's brought back to life in this showing. And of course Yoda and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) live up to the hype (infact Jackson delivers the best line of the movie, a line only HE could deliver). So my overall rating is a good 9.

"As a movie standing on its own merits, ""Attack of the Clones"" is an exciting, memorable action flick. I was on the edge of my seat nearly the whole time, and just when I thought things were going to settle down, the energy fired up again.

And yes, there's actually a male-female relationship. I don't dare use the words ""romance"" or ""love,"" because the acting is so stiff that it's impossible to believe that Anakin and Padme really care about each other. Though considering that Anakin is growing into Darth Vader, the idea that the whole thing is just teenage lust is a little more believable.

For a normal guy I was sadly disappointed as I had hoped for an action movie with a humoristic twist, as I had seen in episode 4 and 5.",-0.016666666666666642,0.6574074074074073
"I was so glad that I read the reviews of this film before I went to see the movie.  I purposefully anticipated horrible acting and two-dimensional characters along with some corny jokes and bad lines.  When I emerged from the theater nearly two and a half hours later, I was pleasantly surprised because it wasn't that bad!  Sure it had it's moments, but doesn't EVERY Star Wars film?  This installment blows Phantom Menace out of the water in every way!  The story itself is becoming much more complex than I had ever imagined.  I am more intrigued by the evolving story of how the Empire came to power rather than I am of the fall of Anakin.  This movie had many subtle and not so subtle references of things to come.  Along with some trademark quotes from the Star Wars franchise, such as ""I've got a bad feeling about this!"" and the most intense fighting scenes ever in ANY Star Wars film, Attack of the Clones has brought back that Lucas magic that he perfected 25 years ago.",-0.008680555555555533,0.5502314814814815
"I just came back from one of the sneak-previews of Episode 2 here in Germany. Before I start, this: I generally hate dubbed versions of movies in English language although I'm German. I can't wait to have the possibility to watch it in the original language -although the dubbing team here in Germany did a really good job as far as sound quality is concerned. Back to the movie itself: Stunning special effects, brilliant sound, very good score (thanks to John Williams). After Episode 1 I honestly thought ""With what can Lucas top this in the sequel as far as technical stuff is concerned?"". Hmm, seems as if he could do it. The story(board) of this episode seems to be better than the one of the first. Although I liked Episode 1 I was a bit disappointed. Attack of the Clones was much more appealing to me. I think Lucas learned many things from The Phantom Menace.  It seems as if he is on the right way to deliver a masterpiece in form of the final prequel.",0.2724234693877551,0.5543027210884355
"I have seen this movie many times, and that is a understatement. When my family got the DVD about 8 years ago me and my brother would watch it together. At the time, the movie had enough eye candy visuals to keep us mentally stimulated and fixed to the screen. Well, for me anyways. Sometimes my brother would fall asleep. I really liked the movie then, and now 8 years later, I still like it. I like it still even after reading all the negative reviews I could find out there, including red letter media. I popped the DVD in again after years of watching it the other day, and I was struck with a realization that so many others seemed to have realized long before hand. This movie really is a bad movie. Now this is all subjective how one feels about this movie I understand, but I finally realized personally that yes, this is a bad movie. A bad movie indeed. Most strikingly it was the CGI that I noticed had not stood up well over time. The movie looks almost like a cartoon now. And the movie seems more childish than I remember. That was my initial feeling after seeing this movie after so many years. It simply has not held up well visually. I cringe now at the love scenes between Anakin and Padame. I see fallacies within. Stiff, forced acting. I can go on and on, but other people have reviewed this movie analytically better than I could ever. One thing that was interesting is that I never cared much for the originals growing up. It was the prequels that sparked my interest in Star Wars and then I began to watch the originals. After going back to the prequels I realized how inferior they are compared to the originals. The OT felt real. The PT, more like cartoons, Attack of the clones more so than the others. After it is all said and done, I still enjoy this movie, although I'm still trying to figure out exactly why I do. Perhaps I have an affinity for B movies.

A tough job indeed when your only weapons are virtual sets and the slimmest and most unbalanced script.

"Manage to catch the film in a midnight show on Wednesday.I'll try to be short and spoiler-free.The overall feeling one gets after seeing this film is that STAR WARS ARE BACK!!!Really this film delivers and is superior to the Phantom Menace in all aspects. The story is very good and its laying the groundwork for the classical trilogy.Humor is there in the right moments and in the right amount.Obi-Wan has the best lines and it was so lovely and funny to see C3PO and R2D2 sharing some screen time.The only thing that doesnt work is the love story.Written very poorly but performed ok is a step below the rest of the film. The work of ILM is clearly superior and if you have the chance of seeing the digital projection you will fully understand.The images are richer in depth and color with great details.You'll have to watch the film over and over again to apreciate its work.The work in Coruscant is excellent and the planet of Camino is great.The Caminoeans are the best aliens in this film. Acting is clearly far better due to the presence of a convincing Hayden Christensen,a very nice work from Natalie Portman(they match very well on screen), a perfect Ewan McGregor and of course Christofer Lee,Temuera Morrison as Jango Fett, Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatin.The role of Samuel L Jackson is expanded and his fighting scenes are great. The action is this movie is UNBELIEVABLE.Star Wars means action and we surely get what we want.There are great sequences like the chase of the jedi starfighter by Slave 1 or the fight between Obi-Wan and Fett.The fight in the Geonosis Arena is like nothing you have ever seen in a Star Wars movie.And finally Yoda is the one to watch for in the movie.Yoda as you have never seen or imagine before.Just sit down and enjoy. On the whole this is a hugely entertaining movie,is a real Star Wars movie which will keep you going back for more in the days to come.The best movie of the year is here!!!Dont miss it.",0.38563104916763447,0.5532733255903989

"Attack of the Clones. It and The Phantom Menace do not compare to the Classic Trilogy for several reasons, and I am getting tired of trying to point this out to people. 1) Too much CGI! There is something in writing we call ""suspension of disbelief""...too much CGI over blue/green screened backgrounds wears down your attention, you keep wondering why Obi-Wan looks so flat... Lucas wants you to feel like you are in that world, and I can't while I am busy wondering how I slipped into a world where perspective is askew. 2) Wooden Romance. The romance between Anikan and Amidalla was described as wooden to me...I second the description. When she confesses her love for him, I was not there. Anikan's rage and sadness I got, I did not get this love. 3) I realized the biggest problem; no good lines. My friend figured this out, and I agree. I can quote the Emperor's lines from RotJ word for word. I found maybe a few lines from tPM and AotC to quote. The script is too hard, rigid, it isn't natural. I feel like I am watching a poorly made documentary about the history of the Republic and the rise of the Empire, not a Space Opera! In closing, Attack of the Clones is a good sci-fi, but it does little to live up to the Classic Trilogy. Sorry fanboys.",0.015768259518259515,0.3341880341880342
"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS** Before going into the cinema to watch the latest George Lucas franchise, I had pre-conceived expectations  and after leaving 140 long minutes later, they hadn't changed. Was this the best looking video game I just saw? The special effects and locations were undeniably spectacular, but a successful film needs story, pacing and acting first and CGI not to get in the way. The love scenes and the lulls with senators sitting around in circles had me looking at my watch, which can't be a good sign for a Star Wars movie. And the less said about the poor actors spouting such banal and cringe-worthy dialogue the better - who says the word `dreamy' anymore? And Anikan comes across as a spoilt brat and not a tormented soul on his way to becoming evil dictator Darth Vader - a missed opportunity. But what about the positives, as there are some visual treats. The last half an hour turned a mediocre movie into an entertaining ride, the Gladiator style monster battle was visual eye candy to behold. OK you knew none of the `good guys' was going to die not even a sense of danger, but please bring a little tension and unpredictability next time. There is however a great scene of Yoda putting down his walking stick to kick 80 year old Christopher Lee's butt.

Nevertheless, I'm intelligent enough to know that when I was a little kid I really liked the Jawas, the Ewoks, the droids, the remarks, and every other little annoying thing about the first three flicks.  That's the genius of Star Wars. People of ALL ages can enjoy it, unlike your favorite Tarantino flick or that new Fatal Attraction-copycat Unfaithful or whatever the name of it is.  Clones not only is true to the all-ages format, it exceeds all saga criteria to be justifiably in an argument for the best episode ever. Now, for all you punks.  When most of you liked Star Wars you were probably little innocent kids, like I was.  Now you're grown.  Things have happened in your life, you've seen other movies, and innocence has been lost.  The same things don't please you anymore.  I defy any of you b**ches to name one motion picture, novel, or story that is so compelling to so many people more than Star Wars.  Lord Of The Rings?

The music is quite good and has a nice opera effect when hearing it. But this doesn't make the movie a ""good"" movie. Although the landscape is beautiful made it has no atmosphere. The whole look is like seeing a normal US city in the future. The whole concept of another world with its own culture and civilization has been neglected. Those people in that planet is nothing more than the USA in the future. And all the people in the movie behaves the same. No cultural differences. The whole idea that the queen had become a senator was terrible. The whole personality, and elegance of an aristocracy have been wiped out by this idea. A chosen queen??? The whole meaning that Luke Leila SkyWalkers background is ""chosen"" and ""special"" is just gone. And the way she acts is so ordinary that you don't find her to be an important person like the people in the movie suggest she would be. The whole concept of the Jedi knight was meant to be some kind of an elite order of knights within the system. In the movie they just differ from the rest of the soldiers that they are fighting with light sabers and not with laser guns. It doesn't fell that they were special at all. They had no special customs or rites. No symbols or mythologies. And the fighting scene was very nice done but also dull. Those people are fighting robots...

The Love story seems not very moving and again Lucas spits in Composer John Williams' face by deleting his E II scoretracks of the great Battle Finale and putting in reedited parts of the Episode I score. And the worst thing: It has long parts, where it's just BORING as hell, which relies on both: Story and photography (on this water planet the set looks like a cheap 2001-Copy).

"I'll admit. I wasn't blown away by ""The Phantom Menace"", but it wasn't bad, by any means. It just lacked the ""umph!"" that the original trilogy had. Understandably, though, seeing as it was his first Star Wars movie in 20 years. All of that has changed. Watching ""Attack of the Clones"", I couldn't help but be reminded of the Empire Strikes Back, arguably the best in the series, even though I favor RotJ. Never before has a musical score guided the movie so aptly. When Anakin is full of rage, you can tell, just by the music. Several emotions play out through the amazing music. There were solid performances all around. Hayden Christensen is astounding. As the movie goes, he fills with more and more hatred, and Hayden pulls it off unbelieveably. Ewan McGregor does great as Obi-Wan, and you really get a sense of wisdom and responsibility. Natalie Portman, gorgeous as always, is great as just a Senator. There is not one part I didn't love. I guess the only complaint I would have is that sometimes, the special effects were ""campy"". As I walked out of the theater, I was already filling with anticipation for Episode 3, so I guess George Lucas did his job well. I would recommend it to anybody, and everybody. Ending, I would just like to say, that this movie, has my favorite battle/war scene I've ever seen. You'll know what I'm talkin' about.

"The only thing really worth seeing was the lightsaber fight between Yoda and Dooku.  That was really cool.  Unfortunately it was also really short.  The other lightsaber fights were pretty lame.  They should have gotten a better actor to play Anakin Skywalker.  It might be an ok teen movie, but for any adult the alleged love scenes are not at all convincing.  Obi-Wan Kenobi is strangely a weakling in this film.  He should know by now that Anakin is turning to the dark side.  Samuel L. Jackson is a good fighter but is oblivious to what's going on around him and makes bad decisions.  There is no hero in this movie and Yoda is the only great character.  That none of the Jedi realize that the chancellor that they work with every day is the dark emperor is a little hard to believe at this point.  The acting is generally stilted, which is forgivable but they sure could use a Harrison Ford--someone who clearly enjoys both the humor and adventure of his situation (being an actor in star wars) and makes light of it enough to bring some spirit into his character.  Some parts of the plot don't make much sense.  After dazzling heroics, a promise to never fail again, and a compelling reason to protect Padme, Anakin seems to get bogged down in weak enemies and give up his responsibility to protect her in the conveyor belt scene, for example.  Padme goes on vacation as soon as she gets home, does no work as a senator and doesn't even keep up with news, and spends most of her time emerging from doorways dressed to allure to meet her spurned Jedi protector.  Anakin shows her that he is turning to the dark side and that he has killed indiscriminately out of hatred and vengeance, and yet she does not seem concerned by this and never brings it up with Obi-Wan or Yoda as you would expect her to do.  Samuel L. Jackson has Boba Fett and Count Dooku under the sway of his light saber, but he leaves them to go fight drones. It seems clear that Yoda could have kicked Count Dooku's ass, but he waits too long to strike a blow and Dooku escapes.  And the way the jedi kill seems inconsistent with the struggle between Luke and Darth Vader in the original Star Wars series.  If Luke kills darth vader he becomes him.  When Vader strikes down Obi-Wan, Obi-Wan becomes stronger than ever before.  Why doesn't this struggle between the light and dark have meaning in the actions of the jedi in episode 2?  Indeed, where is the struggle between good and bad?  It seems that good is really just a confused few led by Yoda.",0.09310796645702306,0.5029874213836477

Much like Lucas's Indiana Jone's trilogy, Star Wars is about larger than life characters, doing what we all wish we could and done in the pulpy style of the films Mr. Lucas enjoyed when he was growing up. Are there plot holes, yes. Is some of the dialogue sound like something from a fortune cookie you get with your Chinese lunch special, unfortunately sometimes yes.  Is this what we expect from Star Wars, ABSOLUTELY!!!  The Star Wars world has always been a fantastic, over the top world, a place where the bad guys can't hit an 8 foot hairy Wookie but the good guys never miss, and the most wise character shares his voice with Miss Piggy.  Do we care?  No.  The critics may say we should but why should we.

"First of all, I regard the first trilogy (4,5,6) with such respect and awe that I really don't think that any movie will ever top the grandeur of them. Even with the amazement I have at Lucas' genius for creating the story I was one of the many who were disappointed with his Phantom Menace.  It had its moments, but overall it fell far short of the most remedial expectations one could have for 20 years of story plotting.  So after the 99' disappointment I didn't have very high expectations for Episode II.  Even though I got the same feeling I did while watching PM - that there was just a bit too much CGI, I REALLY enjoyed this movie.  And I had made up my mind that I was going to be very critical.  Well, Star Wars got a little bit of its magic back.  That special feeling that you only get when you watch a SW movie.  There were some amazing moments in the movie that I didnt see coming that really did work - Anakins telling of the sand people incident.. the last shot of Boba.. Yoda, nuff said.. and the early reference to the Death Star was pure GENIUS..  I think either by blind luck or maybe a sudden realization, Lucas got back to what, in the end made the original series stand the test of time and it wasn't the special effects, because effects of sw were soon outdone and it wasn't the acting (never been one of starwars strongpoints with the exception of a few characters) but the friggin story!!

By far it's the most thrilling of all of the movies.  And it's close to being the best.  Hayden Christensen's portrayal of the gifted yet troubled Anakin Skywalker is spot-on.  Just fantastic.  The story is great.   It pulls you in, and once it gets going, it doesn't stop.  It left me wanting more and I can't wait for the all of the answers to this mystery to be revealed. My only problem with the film is Portman's character.  It's very underwritten, and since she doesn't have much going on internally she just falls flat.  That's what stands in the way of the romance working as well as it should have. But there are so many other things that just left my jaw on the floor for almost the entire running time.

"There was a reason Lucas did episode 4 first; it isn't that complex. Honestly, 4-6 are really just the good versus evil story that has made the original trilogy so popular.  What we are seeing now, is that there is actually more depth than that.  Though I felt some of the dialogue was a little forced, and some of the scenes less than perfect, I also felt Episode II was a very complex and difficult film trying to incorporate many very different pieces.  In the end, it was a challenge well met.  The digital creations performed excellently in actions sequences (though less than perfectly in some other scenes).  The backdrops were great, and most of the digital characters (including Yoda) were beautiful.  I left pondering the truths of the universe, and totally enthralled by the power of the force.

"I really want you to believe me, but I know you won't, because what I'm saying is ridiculous, but, hand on heart, that's how I feel right now, Attack of the Clones is not only the greatest single instalment of Star Wars I've had the pleasure of seeing, but the best damn 2 hours I have spent in a movie theatre. It helped of course, that the movie theatre I was in, was London Leicester square, the night of May 15th, the official Public Premiere of the movie, yes that helped, the gang of guys dressed as rebel pilots, and the cardboard jango fett, that helped too, not to mention the appearance by Anthony `C3PO' Daniels and Rick `Da Man' McCallun, sure all these things were contributing factors, least not forget to mention the amazing Digital projection and the sound, all these things are fillers, gloss, a little nibble of bread before the roast dinner, and what a roast dinner my friends, what a roast dinner. From the moment the camera pans up instead of down after the opening crawl appears on screen, this movie feels different, we linger on shots, we flow with the crowds, I get to analyse the buildings as they beautiful cut threw the clouds, I admire them, my heart swells. I was so scared that I knew too much about this movie, id bought the graphic novel, read the script, read the SCRIPT, but nothing, nothing prepared me for the sheer joy and wonder I saw on that beautiful digitally projected movie screen. I loved every single digital frame of this movie, every single one, this movie is destined to be watched by me hundreds, no, thousands of times. Attack Of The Clones excelled in every single aspect I could every judge a movie on, storyStory, I loved it, I loved seeing the clones conception, I loved seeing what becomes of Anakin, how all these things are set in motion, how the Emperor will tempt and convert him, how OBI-WON will live on after death, all the clues are here. The Acting, this has seen the most criticism, and you what, I don't understand what people are talking about, even if, even IF, you thought the acting was bad, the whole love section of the story, its gone even before its started, its quick, its painless, and It didn't bother me at all. Hayden Christenson was so much better than I was expecting, There are two stand out moments for me in this movie, and both of them are the brilliance of John Williams mixed with acting I never thought I would get the pleasure of seeing in a Star Wars movie, the first, the moment Anakin looks down at what the tusken raiders have done to him, and looks up, the music starts, we know the s**t is going to hit the fan, and then BAM! Chaos. The second, Anakin's painfully poignant and haunting confession, over the top of the Imperial March theme, and you know, you know that mask is only another 4 hours away, and the worst part is, you can't wait. I'm not sure I actually have words for how fantastic that end battle is, but the seamless blend of CGI at last with live action is incredible, are those Clone Troopers Real/CGI? Do I care? Hell no, I was having too much fun, I loved the Obi Won/Anakin confrontation here, no one seems to be talking about it, by I was on the edge of my seat, I half expected Anakin to start waving a lightsabre in old Obi Won's direction, but no, Lucas is saving that for later, you big tease. And yes the Yoda fight scene, this prompted the loudest roar in a cinema I've heard, well ever, every fan knew it was coming and now, now it was time, now it was time to see the Master lay the smack down, and prove why he's at the head of that council.  As soon as Yoda force pulled his sabre out of his belt, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE around me was in geek spasms they were having TOO much fun, TOO much, and the moment Yoda picks up his walking stick at the end, after running rings round Dooku, fantastic, brilliant, comedic genius.

Portman, as lovely as she is, didn't do much better. Ewan McGregor did his best Alec Guinness impression, but they all seemed lost acting in front of a blue screen. acting has never been a strong point for Star Wars films, but it has hit a new low this time. i'm not even going to get into the terrible script. i wish Lucas had done what he did for Empire and let someone else handle all the real film making work. he's obviously more focused on ""dazzleing"" special effects. but to me they were about as dazzleing as watching my lame room mate playing video games on a friday night. maybe i'm old fashioned, but i miss the old days of puppets and creative makeup. they seemed much more realistic. as far as technology has come, alot of the scenes stilled seemed about as real as Mary Poppins dancing with cartoon penguins. i could whine all night about this and that, but what good would it do. yes, i'll be there when the next one comes out on opening night just like i was this time. but untill then i'll be watching the origanal three movies to try to reclaim what's left of my childhood after seeing the last two.",0.14828807556080284,0.40684769775678864

"As an avid Stars Wars fan since I was first introduced to the franchise at age three, I, must sadly say, I was horribly disappointed once again in ""Attack of the Clones"".  The anticipation was killing me... the trailers were impeccable.  I consoled my deepest fears by telling myself... `It can't be worse than 'Phantom Menace' can it?'  While scene to scene, `Clones' was much more visibly exciting than Phantom... there was no more substance. Some where between 1977 and 2002, Lucas forgot that in an epic story... THERE NEEDS TO BE A FREAKIN' STORY!!!  I tried really hard to follow the muddy plot, but alas I was not successful. and I'm a David Lynch fan! Yes, this is as expected a visual masterpiece. The costumes and digital effects were spectacular, and so was the acting... spectacularly awful that is.  Now... don't get me wrong... I don't expect Oscar winning performances from this epic sci-fi franchise (although LOTR: Fellowship of the Ring was acted astonishingly well), but Lucas's now obviously inferior performance as a director has lowered these actors' Oscar caliber talent to a mere line readings by 7th graders.

It took a while for the action to get really worthwhile, but in the meantime the story is filled with plot developed as skillfully as the original trilogy, with plenty of references to future events which the audience already has knowledge of, and C3P0 is once again the comedic humor, replacing the much-despised Jar Jar Binks, who has much less screen time this time around (maybe about 5 minutes, total). Even if you don't like the plot, and you don't like the movie, the last hour of the movie is worth watching just because it's one of the most incredible things you will ever see in a movie.  The final showdown, from when Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Padme are prisoners up to the final lightsaber duel are some of the best moments in cinematic history, with the true epic feeling of the original trilogy being brought back in full force (no pun intended).  Samuel L. Jackson does a wonderful job along with Hayden, McGregor, and Portman, as does Christopher Lee, who portrays the evil Lord Tyranus perfectly. One final thing that I loved, was the fact that he gets away, unlike the villainous Darth Maul in Episode 1.  It's nice to have something to look forward to in the next one (the inevitable showdown with Lord Tyranus). All in all, if you were disappointed by Episode 1, you should go see this at least.

With the myriad of terrible things you could point out from this movie the thing that stands out the most for me is the terrible character development of Anakin Skywalker. I don't know if it is a result of bad acting or bad direction but Anakin never seems to be truly good nor a friend of Obi-Wan's. I found this a little disturbing because in the OTC Obi-wan points out that Anakin was a good man and friend. For me I think what would have remotely helped this film would be to show Anakin as good person with a bad temper. I think a lot of us know people like that. People who are in essence good but have conflicting emotions and inner battles that causes them to do impulsive things. Anakin in this movie does a lot of impulsive things but without any trace of good character. Overall he just appears as the wannabe bad boy of a boy band.,-0.0881944444444444,0.5462962962962963

"Attack of the Clones is everything Lucas Film promised and more.  The movie has the most tenacious action sequences of any other Star Wars film, and is rewarding to the patient audience who knows that a spectacular ending is near.  AOTC is a teaser for Episode III to come and leaves the audience feeling empty, as did Empire Strikes Back in the original trilogy.  There is a class and sophistication that reemerges is Episode II because of the contribution that Christopher Lee makes to this feature, similar to contribution that Alec Guinness made in Episode IV, V, and VI.  The love aspect of the movie is fair, but troublesome because we know what is to come of Anakin.  Do not miss this movie, even if you have never seen Star Wars before.  This movie will expect a prior knowledge to the Star Wars universe, but seeing this movie will make you want to jump back into your childhood as the story unfolds and the actions sequences emerge.  This movie's contribution to the strength of the Star Wars saga is immeasurable.  Also, I loved Spiderman, but AOTC makes Spidy look elementary.",0.2735294117647059,0.5073529411764706
"This movie was so intense, and over the top it brought George Lucas back into a positive eye for me. After he dissapointed almost everyone that saw The first prequil, I thought this would also be dissapointing. He brought us as far as modern cinema can take us, while still having enough suspence to keep us dying for what is next. In this movie he had incredible action sequiences, but still had a strong story as a base. Compared to Episode 1 the acting was top notch. It shows the story we have all put pieces of together in our minds from the bits and pieces that he gave us in the original trilogy. The directoral style includes all the transitions we loved from the Original three, while making it way more of an epic movie. The story flows and tells us that this is not a movie that can only be enjoyed by our kid brother and sister. Everything about this movie is so fulfiling, and perfect that all i want is Episode Three. Plus there is only three minutes of Jar Jar. I will wait for Episode 3, but not get my hopes up, just cause this one is good, doesent mean the next will. Lucas just do what you did with this one and we will all love it.",0.2517180735930736,0.5785579004329005
"I was fortunate enough to attend the screening of Episode II over the weekend at Lucas' charity event in San Francisco. In my opinion, this is the best episode yet. Attack of the Clones is packed with action from start to finish and finally displays the true might of the Jedi Order in their age of power. The love story provides more depth to the Star Wars storyline than fans could have anticipated and the backgrounds of many secondary characters are fleshed out in more detail, helping to bridge the gap between the original trilogy and the prequels. Brought to us in digital form, Lucas' latest masterpiece is visually and audibly stunning in every detail and lives up to the hopes of Star Wars fans everywhere. The wait was definitely worth it!",0.311764705882353,0.49411764705882355
"This movie was awesome.  The lightsaber battles, the chases.  It had everything i could've asked for.  I've been a Star Wars fan for as long as i can remember, and it just keeps getting better and better.  The thing about Clones is that it starts to show the history of where everything in the original movies came from.  It shows primitive star destroyers, and answers some burning questions Star Wars fans might have. Overall it was worth calling in sick to see Episode 2.  I went to the first show in the area, and it was packed.(I hope it breaks Spider-man's record)  The only complaint i have is that we have to wait until 2005 for Episode 3.",0.16915584415584414,0.5127705627705628
"This movie just stinks.

"I had heard mixed reviews on this film. Many said that the acting was bad, that the love story is annoying and that the film was generally not a worthy prequel. I have to disagree. First of all, everyone seems to have forgotten that the acting in the first star wars films was not always top notch. But, bad acting added to its character somehow. I think that the acting in Episode II is perfect for the type of film it is, it adds character. All of you love story critics out there, are you forgetting the love story in the original three. I bet you even liked it, admit it! It is absolutely necessary in this story in order to show one of the forces pulling Annikin off track. In the original three episodes the love story was basically superfluous, so why complain about this one? It is essential to go into this film with an open mind. Forget about the magic of the original films, and forget about the disappointment of episode I and you will have a great time.",0.16815476190476192,0.5553571428571429
"With Episode 2, Lucas sets a new milestone in his Star Wars saga. You could say love plays a major role in this movie and thus, the movie is action packed at the same time. Anakin Skywalker has to fight with too many problems at once, revealing his strength as well as the fact he indeed has still a lot to learn. Senator Amidala is Overwhelmed by her love for Anakin, but does not reveal it until she thinks it is too late. And coming towards the end, finally all the Jedis set up a great fight together...with Yoda showing all his talent. A great deal of emotions are evoked throughout the movie, supported greatly by the magnificent special effect and by the always coherent touch of George Lucas, who does not betray himself.",0.3837337662337662,0.6000649350649351
"In Episode I we caught a glimpse of the world that Lucas had envisioned when he created this dream universe.  However seeing this world the way he wanted brought to many a feeling of unrest and even sadness, maybe a longing for the times when movies had that raw dirty feel to them.  It was released and even though the acting wasn't horrendus, the movie was not accepted.  But, Lucas being the genius that he is, was merely introducing you to the galaxy with Episode I.  In Episode II he reaches his stride and proves that he is not the same horrible Director we saw in Episode I, no he is in fact the creator of yet another phenomenol chapter in this never-ending galaxy of adventure.  Episode II fulfills all expectations and then some, it mixes that clean sence of humor remeniscent of the original trilogy with a wonderful drama.  The movie is well scripted and the young cast carries the movie exceptionally well.  All in all this movie fits nicely into the series and with the Special Edition releases Lucas created in the late 90's there is virtually no continuety errors.  So sit back, order a pizza, and enjoy this movie with your family . . . as soon as it hits video stores.",0.11303927553927556,0.550442612942613
"I have seen the Episode Two on its premiere night in Zagreb, Croatia. Apart from it being organized as a very exciting event, I was disappointed. The new prequel of the Star Wars saga lacks in many things that would make a good movie; good story, good acting and good dialogues. Yes, special effects are great. Yes, the movie is almost perfect _visually_, but other than that...",0.3648933209647495,0.5572124304267162
"George Lucas is a creative genius. He has the incredible ability to visualize and animate a whole other universe and place one of the most compelling stories of all time into that breathtaking setting. What Lucas is not as skilled at, however, is writing. This movie suffered from one of the same problems that plagued ""Phantom Menace"", lack of a script that does justice to Lucas' imaginative fluency. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed ""Attack of the Clones,"" very much and place it third on the list of the best Star Wars films with ""Empire"" and the origional 1977 film ahead just because of the strength of the story and it's visual effects. But if Lucas could find someone to write a script that incorporated a witty, sharp diologue that featured a less blatent, robotic, cliche filled, romantic relationship such as in ""Attack"" (a-la Han and Leia in ""Empire"") this film and episode 3 would benefit greatly.",0.3236231884057971,0.5228985507246376

"Ok, some people may not like it... But there are always people like that. Some people say they don't like the film focusing on one story then going to the next over and over, but thats how film scripts are meant to be written. Some people hated the love story, but it was necessary for the story line. I don't think George Lucas even would have enjoyed writing it.  The start of the film starts strong, then drops off and builds the tension up to the final fight.  Films are meant to be written like that though, think of every film you've seen before (introduction, complication, resolution).",0.12916666666666665,0.6541666666666667
"Attack of the Clones is much better than the Phantom Menace.  First of all, Annacin is a great character.  The kid, I forget his name did a great job. I think he was the dynamic character that Episode I was missing.  Also, Jar Jar is only in it for a couple of minutes, if that.  Third, everything is beginning to wrap , which is really cool.  Fourth, Yoda kicks ass.  Fifth, Natalie Portman is amazing.",0.2818181818181818,0.4636363636363636
"George Lucas has always had a style of intercutting various places and making it come together in the end, but this is all over the place. Unlike other Star Wars movies where there is a planet to start on, a space sequence and another planet, Episode II takes the viewer too many places many of which are not exciting at all.  I know Lucas had to establish the connection between Aanikin and Padme more in this episode but it seems like over a third of the movie is simply exbisition.    As a result, this is unfortuantly not the summer blockbuster that it was made out to be.  The love story really slows down the action part of the story and looses the attention of the die hard fans quickly.  And people new to the series can forget about easily following the plot.  In all, there are only two memorable scenes in the entire movie, R2D2 flying and Yoda kicking ass. There are messy editing techniques in the Gladiator scene where ObiWan and Anakin suddenly get lightsabers after losing them earlier, and the role of Jango Fett is not described nearly well enough.  I am glad to see that Jar-Jar has been given a much smaller role than his previous in Phantom and that the classic comedy comes from the R2D2 and C3PO characters again. However the stupidity in Jar Jar comes through too much still as he makes one of the biggest mistakes in the galaxy as a senator.  Overall, if you didn't like Phantom chances are that you probably won't be crazy about Attack of the Clones.  As a huge fan of the original trilogy it hurts to say that I would rather see Spider-man again rather than sit through this once more.",0.09207070707070705,0.4950164914450629

"First of all, let me say that this movie is extremely baller. I saw it twice in one day! Everything that was wrong with The Phantom Menace was eliminated or corrected in Attack of the Clones. Most importantly, Jar Jar had drastically fewer lines, and therefore, did not ruin the movie. One thing I liked in particular was the fact that you find out what happened to the characters we already know about. For example, instead of some random character like Darth Maul, we get to see what happens to Anakin as he is learning the way of the Jedi. If you haven't already seen this movie, turn off your computer, get up, get out, and go see it. Greatest movie ever.",0.19560185185185186,0.7074074074074074
"Well, the middle SWs seem to be the best, first Episode V, now Episode II. Padmè is now just a senator, since Episode I she has finished her two terms as queen of Naboo. Oddly, Anikin and Obi-Wan have both aged over ten years, but Padmè hasn't aged at all. In Episode II many things are beginning to lead up to Episode IV, there are plans for the Death Star, Obi-Wan is aging quite a bit, Anikin is swaying to the dark side, Luke's step-grandparents are introduced, and an early type of Stomrtrooper and Imperial Cruiser are introduced, yet they are good and working for the Jedi! Even though it is hyped up as a love story, it seems to have even more action that most of the other SWs and has way less mushy stuff than you would think.

"""Attack of the Clones"" stars Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, and Samuel L. Jackson.  It tells the story of the growing up period for the cruel Jedi taken over by the dark force (Darth Vader)or whatever you call it.  When the queen's life is suddenly threatened (Portman) and is in stake, the Jedi use all kinds of ways to keep her safe. I personally am not a fan of George Lucas.  I have seen all the episodes 4, 5, and 6, and also 1 which was released in 1999.  I recently viewed the 2nd Episode and absouletly hated it.  I also think it had no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Athough the special affects were pretty good and the scene where the Jedi Master Yoda fights with his lightsaber, the rest of the movie flat out sucks.  It has a horrible script and storyline, the acting was cheesy and it was filmed in digital, unlike the previous episodes.

While perhaps the acting was not as impressive as it could have been, and there may have been the occasional cheesy line, Episode II was not only a great Star Wars movie, but a great film on its own.  The romance subplot alone brought an emotional level to the movie unmatched by any previous Star Wars episode, while I thought the characters in general had a more natural, human aura to them than before. Okay, the first, very political portion was a small exception, but it was only small.  This was a very dynamic movie; in addition to the benefits that the romance story brought, the action was just as intense as--if not more intense than--that of previous Star Wars movies.

"While I beleive that Lucas did make everything that was wrong right, I would like to point out one major flaw. Hayden Christiansen or whatever his name is, is NOT a good Anakin Skywalker. I was disgusted with his performance. Duely noted that there aren't many out there at the age to portray Anakin that are available, but he was completely dull and was embarassingly rigid with the lines. While i understand Anakin is supposed to be a whipped little Jedi boy, the actor did not get into his role, instead it was Hayden playing Anakin instead of Hayden BEING Anakin. Aside from that Yoda kicked ass in the duel and the rest of the movie was extravagant, casting too, It's just that some people can't act, and well they have to face themselves sooner or later.",-0.10963203463203462,0.5282467532467533

Not a problem, one would say, thinking back to han Solo and princess Leia, but in Attack of the Clones it's over the top. It is extremely annoying to see Padme en Anakin rolling about in the grass, totally in love, but still denying it, suported by horrible quasi-romantic music. yugh. The movie really gets going after this part. The second part of the movie is loaded with great action scenes, the best being Yoda fighting count Dooku with a lightsaber. Respect Yoda!

I tried to use the force myself to have his character killed, but it didn't work out. As far as storyline goes, this movie was pretty good because it really brought a lot of things together. People and events of the original 3 movies (IV, V, and VI) start to come together in this one. The problem with it is that Lucas still felt it necessary to include the lame, infantile one-liners that make people over the age of 10 cringe. Shoreline Theaters was overrun with little children who have probably never seen the original films, and who probably can't appreciate any plot developments (yes, it has some). So as I expected, I was struck by the commercialism of the movie and at times I felt as if I were watching an infomercial, not a film. Lucas included some garbage that made it hard to take some of this one seriously. All I can say is, thank God it wasn't The Phantom Menace again.",-0.03828125,0.5942708333333333

The love interest aspect of the movie just didn't fit it seemed and felt like someone added in for the cash in(titanic any one).To me it seemed like a wasted opportunity because both are promising actors but their scenes together are limp and lifeless,lacking any real intensity.I could go on but it feels like waste of my own energy and time to do so.All i can say is i hope the next episode has some backbone and remmembers that some us enjoys a movie that has a bit of heart and uses it s head and dose'nt just rely on a pretty face.",0.2019119769119769,0.5203823953823954

"I am a big Star Wars freak, having been totally captivated by the original movie as a 12 year old boy. Having said that I must say that Attack of the Clones was very disappointing. There are two fundamental things that bother me about this movie. Firstly, the plot is unlike anything we have seen previously. In other episodes, good and evil were always clearly defined, with good struggling against seemingly impossible odds to emerge victorious, or at least not lose too badly. In this movie the good side seem to be consuming themselves with there own stupidity and arrogance, and it is hard to feel any empathy for their struggle. The other grating thing is the CGI. It is right over the top with too much happening on the screen at one time to make a strong impact. A lot of the CGI heavy scenes seem to be straight out of a computer game; but not a particularly good computer game.

I expected battle, thrills, mystery and instead i've got a boring romance. Geez, if i would've wanted romance i would try english patient. The last 30 minutes has all that the rest of the film lacks, fighting jedi, battles, and is quite fun. But master yoda fighting with lightsaber is so childish.

The intro scene is just as it should be. It's intense and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. We also learn new things. I like the scene were Kenobi ""accidently"" achieves knowledge on the Clone army. The movie's main theme is the ""development"" of Anakin Skywalker. I think the change of him and his ""turning dark"" is magnificently presented to us. On another note, reviews say the actors' performances are beyond poor. I must disagree.

"Seeing the movie at a press preview before it's release, many people were asking me what i thought of it and wether it was worth watching. I said 'Hey, it's Star Wars, it's always worth watching!' And i was right. The second installment of the epic is a great movie to watch. It's fun, has great action sequences and, occasionly, funny. The strong point of the film is the action. It's brilliant and better than it has been before. The final battle at the end of the movie is stunning, pitting 200 Jedi against Count Dooku's droid army. the clone soldiers are brilliant, the design of their uniform is cleverly close to that of the Storm Troopers, showing what is going to happen to them in the end. The special effects are also a brilliant feature in the film. But what did we expect from Industrial Light and Magic? ILM are ahead of everybody else when it comes to computer graphics. For the first time in all of the Star Wars films, Yoda is no longer a puppet but computer generated. At first i was think that this would ruin the movie, but it is superbly done and i have nothing bad to comment on it. What is hugely dissapointing is the script. It lacks that certain thing that is seen in the original trilogy. The lines that Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGreggor) finds himself saying are utterly rubbish some of the time. I found myself laughing at a couple of them at the very most. Then the scripting leads onto the acting, which is done consideringly well. Newcomer Hayden Christensen portrayed Anikin very well, showing his love and anger (both should not be shown by a Jedi) very well. Overall, the new installment of the Star Wars saga is a great movie. Certainly better than Episode 1 in most areas, fans of the Star Wars universe should not be disappointed.

If you do see this, please watch one of the originals afterwards to wash yourself of this horrible atrocity.

Anakin Skywalker (the new kid) is annoying and the love story between him and the Senator Padmé Amidala is lacking in chemistry and believability. The effects are as good as you'd expect from a 'Star Wars' film -- the flying and fighting sequences are great -- but if anything they go overboard with them -- as you can just see the video game footage being churned out straight from the movie! The only other real complaint I had with the film -- is all the bouncing around can be a bit tiresome and confusing. C3PO isn't in it nearly enough but when he is, he steals the show. Yoda's quips and 'Crouching Tiger' moves were enjoyable as was the always delightful Ewan McGregor. At the end of the day, the movie will be HUGE and it is better than the last one.

What I enjoyed the most, other than the action, was the way it advanced the plot and connected to the Original Trilogy in more ways than one.

So much happens story-wise that explains what is to come that I'm not sure one could get it all in just one viewing.  The effects and sound were excellent; we were fortunate enough to view it in a theater that recently installed a digital projector, and the picture and sound are a welcome improvement over actual film.  I don't think ""Star Wars"" fans will be disappointed in this installment as they likely were with Episode I.  It's not a perfect film, but it was satisfying enough, particularly in its plot lines and their developments.

The real movie begins when Obi Wan comes to the cloners planet and when we see the first real fight between Obi Wat and Jango Fett. Too bad that George Lucas once again kills the bad guy, whos one of the best character of the movie (the same was with Darth Maul).

"I just saw this at a press screening and can happily say that at Last, Star Wars returns to the heady status it reached with Empire strikes back, one of the best sci-fi films ever produced. The film takes a while to get going, after a fabulous chase sequence, it appears to steer down the path of exposition, and becomes heavily focused in politics. However it soon picks up again and the last half hour leaves you with a strong desire to see more. There are other problems, at times the CGI is glaringly noticable, and you can't help feeling that Yoda doesn't quite look right, no where near as good as the puppet. Similarly there are some scenes which are a tad on the long side, and some of the dialogue appears to be lifted straight from the Carry On leftover bin, primarily C3p0. Yes Jar- Jar is Back and annoying as ever, but at least he gives us an official excuse to hate him. Despite the gripes however, this remains a solid piece of entertainment, highly enjoyable, with great acting, and a wonderful script.",0.15420087575259994,0.4459633278598797

Although it is wellmade, many elements and ideas are taken from the first 3 films, thats the only thing where I thought that it could have been made differently.",0.33888888888888885,0.6222222222222221

The movie is filled with many twists and turns, and delivers with the things that episode one had left out.  (Jar Jar with only about three minutes on screen time).  The story takes place ten years after menace, and puts you right into the action from scene one.  The story gets a little slow and redundent through the corny love scenes, but makes up for it with Jango and Boba Fett.

If you were somewhat disappointed in ""The Phantom Menace"" (or ""Return of the Jedi"" for that matter) this movie is definitely a return to the grand storytelling and action of the first Star Wars films.

Anakin Skywalker is older and more arrogant and Obi-Wan is more efficient at being a Jedi Master. This sets and backgrounds of the movie are unbelievable, and the music totally rules.

I really hoped that Jar Jar Binks made his first and last appearence in Star Wars episode I, but was disappointed. He appearenced in the film and more than once. It may be due to a technical advance to make characters like that, but to me puppets that were used in Episode IV, V and VI looked more real and had more feeling. And to speak about the plot itself, it was cheesy. Too much happened in too short time. I think Lucas tried to add too much to the film and so he still couldn't produce the feeling the older episodes had. The old man is just too creedy.

Anakin and Amidala do not come close matching the fire, the spark, the wit (basically everything) of Leia and Han and Anakin is actually quite a drab character overall.  Thankfully, Jar-Jar is an inconsequential bit-player in this movie and for that, we can all be thankful.

"As a rather avid star wars fan, it seems blasphemous to give the newest addition of the series such love, but I can't however, find flaw with Episode 2.  It is a non-stop rollercoaster ride, with enough light saber action to satisfy the most discerning of critics, and a romantic sub-plot that is both entertaining and moving.

"Well this is an excellent study in what happens when a director tries to make a film that offers something for everyone, basically catering to all demographics. The result is at times inevitably mixed. Episode 2 remains true to the franchise but at the same time has perhaps what true purists might consider a bit too much of a romantic subplot. This in and of itself is not truly a bad thing but the script and lines could certainly have used some work in this department as most of the lines come off as corny or sappy. This is frustrating as you'll frequently find yourself laughing when one probably shouldn't be. Lucas does make up for this however with more than adequate doses of action and a genuinely intriguing storyline as one would expect. Don't expect to be swept off your feet when you walk into the theater as you might with the common whiz bang explosion openings most common in action films today but rather give the film time to mature and you should leave the theater thoroughly satisfied. When Clones is good it's GREAT, but when it's bad it's horrendous.

"Seeing this movie on the midnight showing was possibly the biggest waste of sleeping time I could ever imagine. I loved the original trilogy, and have never met a person that didn't. It was fun, it was engaging, and more importantly...I could believe it. In 2003, however, George Lucas has a bottomless pit of a wallet, and can shell out all he needs...to make this horrible, repeat...HORRIBLE movie. I thought, as would every fan, that Lucas would listen to the mistakes he made from the first. No, actually, he ignored them. Altogether, ignored them...and made a film equally bad, even if Jar Jar only makes a slight appearance as opposed to a full fledge role (a casting mistake from the start). First of all, because I do have basis, is CG. Computer graphics. Why is this a bad thing? Fake. It all looks amazingly...FAKE. I believe that I saw maybe one scene with C-3PO in a real, original trilogy, man in a metal suit, C-3PO suit. From there on? CG. In fact, Lucas decided that C-3PO is so amazingly cute, that he allows the droid to catch a 75 MPH hovering repair car by his hands in midair. We're talking, the same droid that could barely hold onto a wrench in A New Hope. Everything in the movie looks so unbearably fake. Lucas seems to have totally misused his position and vision, to give us 2 full length, badly scripted cartoons (the scripting was THAT bad. No scene took itself seriously, and was hardly believeable). The same ships, troops, and machines we found so amazing 20-25 years ago are now pale, cartoonish, and convenient. By convenient, I mean that the realistic, battle worn fighters that maneuvered their hearts out in the original series now conveniently zip around the screen like it's no big deal. Luke was a Jedi, and a damn good pilot, and even he can't make his ship double it's speed whenever he deems it convenient. Battles were horrible, paced was too fast (especially if you compare them to the long drawl of a buildup), and never got to the heart of it where we found ourselves so comfortable. In Jedi, we found ourselves a part of the action. It was dramatic and wild and engaging. Now, we barely get a chance to catch a glimpse of the action. Impersonal invasions by millions of CG (once again, the CG curse looms on) troops are barely followed, and if they are, it's too fake looking to buy.",-0.006509209744503847,0.5463472964943554

"A love story. A coming of age tale. A mystery. And yes, a comedy, too. This movie was way better than episode I. You will care for the characters just like you did for Han Solo and Chewie. The script-writing surpassed that of the 1999 so-called Star Wars film ""The Phantom Menace"". One would have to try extremely hard NOT to enjoy episode II. Some have complained that it moves too slow, I say hogwash. The development of Anakin and Padme's relationship calls for patience, as does love in everyday life. Besides Yoda putting the smack down, the other fantastic element in ""Attack of the Clones"" is C-3PO and R2-D2's humorous relationship. They bond like they did in the days of ""Return of the Jedi"" and episodes IV and V as well. I was almost moved to tears at parts of this film, like when Anakin figures out a horrible fate has befallen someone in his family (I'm trying not to give it away). The emotion evoked in this portion of ""Clones"" could never have been reached with a 50 foot pole by ""Menace"". Hype didn't kill ""The Phantom Menace"", bad dialogue did. And forget the notion that Lucas dwells too much in the realm of digital technology, because with the script and directing that ""Clones"" had, the technology blended well with the romance and mystery which the film so tenaciously held. You will see why Anakin is such a dangerously powerful force to be reckoned with, you will understand Boba Fett's bloodlust, and you will be glad that Jar Jar Binks is only in a fraction of the film.

Hayden Christensen who plays Anakin Skywalker surprisingly fills the role well and it is totally plausable that he will become Darth Vader. Natalie Portman is totally beautiful and her character is allowed to do so much more. Ewan McGregor even if he did look like he was from the Bee Gee's displayed a more mature character.

I was kind of figuring that his turning would involve someone betraying him, or something along those lines, but as it turns out he's just stupid! 10 years of Jedi training, and all he thinks about is a girl he met when he was 8 (or so). Don't even get me started on how (or why)Jar-Jar got elected as a representative in the Senate..... Overall, I think they spent more time on figuring out effects and visuals than they did on the story and script. Which is really disappointing considering that this is supposed to be the genesis from which the original 3 came from. Hopefully they'll take a little more care in doing the last one.

"The critics have said that this is a dull, uninteresting story, with uninspired performances and overwhelming CGI graphics.  The critics who report that are missing the boat on the Star Wars phenomenon.  This is Star Wars where the story and the action go hand in hand and predicate each other.  The characters draw you in not by their acting but by their uniqueness and flaws.  Take Boba Fett by example, this character has less than 10 lines in the entire saga, yet is one of the most beloved Star Wars characters.  Jar Jar Binks is universally hated, and what does that say right there?  Usually people can't agree on much at all.  It's difficult to compare performances by any of the artists in these movies.  I'll agree most of Star Wars is hype and marketing, but in the end it lives up to it's billing.  Have you ever noticed that when people talk about the Star Wars movies they say what they like and didn't like, and everyone is instantly part of the conversation.  This is a universal truth that Star Wars has brought together a generation of people.  I don't know anyone who's never seen each of these movies, nor hasn't an opinion on them.  Everyone has they're favorite characters and sometimes they are villains.  As for this movie, it's probably the most compelling, at times its slow and you yearn for the trademark action sequences, but you also feel drawn to the destruction of Anakin.  Hayden Christenson is either a real talent or ""The Force"" George Lucas did a masterful job of directing him on how to link his performance with Jake LLoyd, there is a strong resemblance, as well as some of the same facial expressions that work well.  Ewan McGregor is much better as ObiWan this time and links his performance to Alec Guiness very well.

"...What can I say, unlike Episode I, Episode II actually made me feel like I was watching the Star Wars saga of old.  I don't think anything can make up for the embarasment of the ""Phantom Menace"", but this movie definitely shows that George Lucas hasn't completely lost his mind!  ""Attack of the Clones"" was an imaginitive movie that created new worlds and characters in the old Star Wars fashion instead of just recreacting old Star Wars themes and gimics in a dry, uninspired way.

In AotC the characters introduced in Episode I are fleshed out some more, we catch up on young Padawan Anakin Skywalker, and how he has developed under his Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (suitably played by Ewan McGregor) as they are assiged to protect Padme ( the beautiful Natalie Portman); the former Queen Amidala from unknown ruffians.The story unfurls steadily towards a dazzling climax, carried in no small part by the sublime special effects ,certainly the most advanced yet seen, and Lucas' trademark dissolves. Lucas has created a magical Universe populated with as diverse and colourful characters as imagination will allow. Whereas Episode I left a sour taste of ""scorchio"" , Episode II the viewer gagging for a sequal. A thouroughly enjoyable film. And Starwipe to Episode III.",0.26423160173160176,0.5034632034632034

"With a somewhat bland opening scroll I thought I was going to be disappointed.   It sounded more like C-span than Star Wars.   Then there were the first lines of dialogue between Padme and her chief of security that sounded as wooden as a high school production of a comical whodunit. I sat with disgust in my plush stadium theater chair with 32 ounces of artificially flavored lemonade drink and thought that its insipid flavor might be the most enjoyable part of this experience.   Well, I was wrong! Yes, this movie has some faults that are easy to spot; they may even reach distracting and annoying to most fans of the Star Wars saga.  However the compelling action, visual artistry, and mythic scope of the original movie are back and pushed up to modern standards.   This isn't just Star Wars redone, but a Star Wars for those who came to the move to see the trailer for the new Matrix films.   What is the Matrix you ask? Yoda is the Matrix! Yes, as you probably know by now, Yoda is a bigger part of this film and the little green sprite shows why he is afforded so much respect. Lucas has made a film that will satisfy all his fans on some level.  Just remember when C3PO's highly annoying banter is making you hate what Lucas is doing, that the developmentally disabled guy next to me in the theater laughed his ass off.   C3PO will quickly go away for at least a few more scenes of glorious Jedi combat, or perhaps for the harsh moment that turns the heart of a little boy named Boba so ice cold.  When C3PO returns, or Jar-Jar, or whatever, just gloss it over and remember that it is not there for you.   The rest of the film is for you.    Stick to appreciating the parts you like and you will find this one of the most satisfying films in the series.  If you go into this film hating Lucas for Phantom Menace, then you will find faults and you will hate this film.  Just remember, had you never seen Menace, and if this had been the first film after more than a decade of waiting, that you would be singing Lucas's praises as the greatest producer ever. This film establishes several facets that the previous film failed to do. Most importantly is a couple of villains that are more than just the ugly and scary looking threat of Darth Maul.   Sure Maul looked cool, and his moves were a highlight of Menace, but he was just another Jedi warrior with no real character, no real sinister side, a real one-dimensional bad guy. Here we have both Jango Fett, and Count Dooku/ Darth Tyranus.   Jango is a proud father, a cunning warior, and a unique link to the original series. Count Dooku is a villain with charm who can cunningly use lies to seem to be a hero of sorts.   Not only that, but his skills as a dark Jedi seem greater than our young heroes can match.  In Menace we knew our hero's skills were greater than an inept trade federation, and even a more than fair match for Maul.  There was never any threat.   AOTC delivers threats that seems more dire and real. The next improvement is an Anakin that is just about perfect for his part. He is the essence of teenage hormones running amok and as rash and stupid as real teens are.    To adult fans of the series the quick, rash, and sometimes nonsensical romance between Anakin and Padme may seem stilted and false.   Just think back to when you were just learning to date and remember your own rash and nonsensical behavior as a rebellious teen. There is a bit (which would be a spoiler, I will just hint that one of Anakin's actions would probably wind up tried at a tribunal in The Hague) that seemed right for the development of Vader, but comes at a place in the movie where both the audience and Padme must gloss over it and still consider him a hero for the rest of the film. Finally we have a real increase in the wonder factor.    Menace gave us a muppety two-headed alien announcer that talked like ABC sportscasters, more of the same old Hutts, and an annoyingly earthbound, and downright offensive, patois spoken by Jar-Jar.  AOTC gives us a goul/insectoid run robot factory, a waterbound race of supermodel thin, globe-eyed scientists, and a capitol city/planet that takes off where Bladerunner left off.   To be fair, Naboo still looks too much like the renaissance Italy right down to a gondola, and Tatooine isn't exactly a stunningly original local. You still can't ask for much more wonder than an all-out land battle between Jedi, droids, clones, and fearsome alien gladiatorial beasts. All in all Star Wars fans should rejoice and enjoy a fine addition to the series.   If you find this film annoying and faulty, that perhaps you should sell your vacuum-sealed collection of mint in-package Star Wars action figures and go get a real life.",0.08139359582216722,0.5362103346389061

"Okay, so its actually a terrible movie.  But thats what makes it so good! Like the wretchedly bad Spiderman, this movie's success lies in the unintended laughter it ellicits.  George Lucas' sudden inability to write good dialogue is overshadowed only by his obscene lack of directorial talent.  GIVE ME SPIELBERG!  Though the man is loathe to me, he is good at what he does.  However, the sad turth is, no matter how bad Lucas is, it doesn't matter now; he will still make millions off of each piture, in ticket sales, rentals, and of course, merchandising.  Already, my home is flooded with Republic Gunships and Jedi and Clone troopers.  And thats just the beginning.  SOon come the myriad Lucasarts games, all of which will be terrible (note: some releases have been good, see Rogue Squadron or the X-Wing/Tie Fighter games.)  Thus, Lucas is confident that no matter how bad he doe with Star Wars, it will be successful.  And apparently, his actors know this too.  From Natalie Portman to Samuel L. Jackson to Hayden Christensen, and yes, even Ewan MacGregor, every actor/ess in this movie is talented to the extreme.  See Natalie in Heat or The Professional, see Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown, see Hayden Christensen in Life as a House, see Ewan MacGregor in Trainspotting or Moulin Rouge, all display fine talent.  So why do they all sleep through this movie? Similarily, what the hell was wrong with Ewan and Liam Neeson in Episode One?   Have you ever seen Rob Roy?  Liam!   Come on!

I don't know if that makes me less critical than others but I loved this movie. Like most I was disappointed with Phantom Menace when I saw it in the theater. Since viewing it on DVD repeatedly, I would say it has gotten much better with each viewing. Yes Jar Jar can get annoying, but hey who doesn't have a friend that doesn't get on their nerves once in a while? That being said, I think that Attack of the Clones was a great movie. Right up their with my personal favorite, Empire Strikes Back. I will not try to summarize everything for you. I would primarily like to say to everyone who is saying that this doesn't rate with episodes IV or V: go back and watch them again. I think maybe you've forgotten how less than perfect they were. Just think of Luke whining about going into town when Uncle Owen wants him to do chores. It is comically bad. So all the criticism about the love scenes etc I think are way overly critical.

""How are they going to do this"". I will agree with some of the things I have seen already.. George is trying to put in too much. Some of the lines in this script are almost too hammy. There are times when he needs to heed by the idea of ""less is more"".What made the  first trilogy so terrific, was that you felt what you were watching was  truly about another place, another time.. Here again, just like with the pod race, there are human conventions, trying to make things seem more familiar.These aren't really needed.. John Williams score again is great. Not quite the power of EP I, but the music in the grand finale was really moving. The plusses here were the transformation of Anakin.. You could really see what will turn him in the next chapter. Also, Yoda is incredible!!! When you see him wielding a lightsaber, you'll go nuts!.. His attitude is wonderful in this chapter.. He really takes control of the Jedi council, and acts more as a leader than you have ever seen. This chapter also begins to explain a lot of lore of the first trilogy..

"Attack of the Clones is simply not as good as Star Wars, but then again that's our problem..... we are expecting the impact of A New Hope. But this is Star Wars in 2002. The special effects are outstanding. The crew has to win the special effects oscar or I'm going to cut my feet off!! Obi Wan flying through the air dangling off an assassin droid is simply a new achievement in special effects. Hayden Christensen shows off a fantastic talent, especially in his reunion with his mother. Superb. Portman's acting is a little wooden especially in the ""by the fire"" scene. But what points she loses in acting, she more than makes up for with sensual, lingering looks & fantastic costumes (well done the costume dept). It's in this film that we first get a taste of everybodies favourate Star Wars character. Although he's still only a young child, he still manages to give off a ""I wouldn't mess with me if I were you"" aura. Boba Fett of course is being bought up by himself (or rather he's a clone of his older, slower self), that is Jango Fett. & Yoda..... wow.

"Where do I begin.  I'm dazed, and slightly confused.  Let me, like many others, set my stall out right here.  I am a massive Star Wars fan.  The brilliance is there for all to see.  I loved mainly the human aspect of the original trilogy, the emotion, the wit and the passion for what they believed in.  When The Phantom Menace was released, I was overjoyed with spectacle of the thing.  It created the scene for what was going to happen, in a distant kind of way.  Even the universally hated Jar Jar Binks couldn't stop me from really appreciating what this film was trying to achieve.

Granted, Star Wars is just a movie and doesn't consume my life (like it does for so many others), but Episode II compares to that of The Empire Strikes Back.

Instead, he and all the other aliens look like phony CG characters that I CARE NOTHING ABOUT! And the stormtroopers?

Those out there who are true Star Wars buffs will really notice many of these.  Thanks to new computer technology, there are also some great opportunities to see some ""old"" characters do some new tricks.  No more hints - if you see it you'll know what I mean!  With the fantastic, epic action to parallel scenes in films like Braveheart and Gladiator, its hard to notice how sloppy the writing and dialogue are.

But I kept faith with Mr Lucas, and returned to view it again. This time, wow! The special effects were even more impressive as different facets, especially of Coruscant caught your eye. The dialogue was pure Star Wars - much ""I have a bad feeling about this"" etc. And even the romance angle did not grate, appearing quite sweet. But what had not changed was the feelings the last half hour brought from me, what with Yoda proving his worth as Jedi Master (at last!), Mace Windu kicking ass, and the first appearance of the Clone (Storm)Troopers and most impressively, the Star Destroyers. The acting also seemed better this time, maybe I`d just accepted it was Star Wars not Shakespeare. Watch this film, and then watch it again to get what you missed - which will be a lot!

"This movie was excellent!  Episode 1 was a great fall for Lucas, and in my opinion did not even deserve the title Star Wars near it!  However Star Wars: Episode II - ATOTC was a bounce back that only the masters of Jedi could accomplish. All around me I hear how it was to mushy, well HELLO the first three are basically the story of Anikin's transformation into the totally dark Darth Vader.  The mushy, the sentimental are what pushes him over the edge, they are what makes up Darth Vader. As for the Acting, I hear Wussy, and weak and so on.  However If you look at the original triology, look at Luke.  I can see it all come together. Luke was over emotional too, a bit of a whinner, but when pushed, WATCH OUT! So maybe with that in mind it may be a little clearer. I read a comment about Obi being weak because he hasn't caught on about Anikin.

Ugh! Oh, and the real sets and locations in 1977 look much better than digital ones do in 2002.

The problem with critics is that they don't consider the movie in leu of the other 4 films.  In this light, the movie is nearly perfect.  Lucas fills in many of the plot and character gap and sets us up for the fall of Skywalker.  I'm sure after Episode III we will all be in amazement how Lucas crafted this space opera that has spanned 50 years on screen and 30 years in our lives.",0.35875,0.6713888888888888

"Never has a film delivered so fully upon my expectations.  Grand, grand filmmaking, brilliantly executed, imminently watchable, full of thought, full of the spirit of the enterprise.  This coming from a person who is very anti-computer generated effects, a person who believes the magic of the first movies relied on the winning formula of fantastic ideas added to real situations, resulting in a perfect movie.  With the cg effects, I felt the film would feel too cartoonish, too distant, and harder to relate to.  I still much prefer real costumes to computer imagery, but Lucas is a visionary, and he has created a brilliant film.  What is most appealing to me is the love story, despite what is being reported it is exceptionally well-done, and the dialogue is superb as well.  Some critics do not realize that Anakin and Padme are from two stern backgrounds, and their feelings of love are forbidden, so to have that kind of connection between them they respond with their hearts and their glances.  The whole series from the beginning left the largest elements in simplicity, like the force, the light and the dark, and in simplicity it is easier to relate to.  The same with their love, it is something everyone has felt, it is both a gift and a curse for them because of their situation, and we relate by how well they portray it in their dialogue and behavior.  Hayden Christensen does an exceptional job of portraying Anakin, in fact he IS Anakin.  He portrays the arrogance that leads to the dark side, and the love and compassion that make him such a tormented being, the one who eventually let's Luke know that Luke `was right' in knowing that he still had good in him.  Natalie Portman is not only beautiful, but a marvelous character in the film, who plays the stern side of politics along with the side of love and compassion exceptionally well, fitting Hayden's emotions of love and anger perfectly.  No wonder Hayden was chosen for the part, they have real chemistry on screen.  The scene where Anakin first shows some signs of his power and anger is incredible, a scene that really puts the point across, and helps us identify with his character and the grandness of Lucas' story.    Ewan McGregor is a captivating lead, one who carries the film with considerable ease, much like his predecessor the great Alec Guinness.  He is wise and powerful, yet burdened and somewhat overshadowed by his brave young Jedi apprentice. Lucas' pacing is exceptional, the transitions, the light to dark, the dark to light, the screen fades, the handling of his material: grand enough to encompass the whole galaxy, minute enough to trace the details of love between the two leads, and the disdain of a wise leader, seeing the arrogance in his young apprentice turning to something more horrible than he can possibly imagine.",0.3260600130463145,0.6305120678408349

"Besides what the critics might have said, I loved this movie down to the very last second. While still showcasing a little choppy dialogue that is somewhat characteristic of Lucas, the movie was still a thrill to watch. The fifth installment in a series of six movies, this one managed to make good on what its predecessor didn't. One noticable improvement can be seen in Anakin Skywalker.  While still not the greatest acting ever seen, Hayden Christensen does a much better job on the character than Jake Lloyd did.  While Anakin in ""The Phantom Menace"" came off as poorly acted kid hero, Anakin in this movie comes off how he should, a teenager who is slowly turning to the dark side. After seeing the movie twice, I can safely say that the critics were over critical of the acting. On to the movie itself.  While some accuse the first two hours being to slow and boring, I never found that to be true.  Anytime the movie would start to drag, something exciting happened, which kept you wanting to see more. Then there is the last half hour of the movie.  One of the greatest parts of any movie I have ever seen, it gives a little taste of everything, including some humor that involves R2-D2 and C-3PO.  The last half hour also showcases some of the most amazing visual effects ever shown.  The realistic looking CGI Yoda is a testament to the time spent on making the visual effects look real.  And don't get me wrong, the effects through the first two hours are amazing too.  The sound is also done quite well, and helps to immerse in the picture even more.  I would say this movie is a shoo in for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Editing Oscars, as have many of the other Star Wars movies.  ILM and Skywalker Sound show why the are considered to be one of the best in the business. All in all, this movie is a great one, and worth seeing many times.

"It was good, it wasn't great. George Lucas should strictly be an idea factory--spitting out the great, general plot lines--and leave the script writing to those who know what they're doing. There were several lines in this movie that stank of cheese--they were just plain stupid (The Christopher Lee line to Yoda at the end being the most memorable example of crap). It was George Lucas TRYING to make it cool. He can't do that. The first three movies didn't TRY, they just WERE.         GOOD NEWS: JarJar is quite scarce in this film. BAD NEWS: Believe it or not (and this may be a spoiler) but C-3PO seems to fill JarJar's void. WHAT THE...? Did anyone else notice the Sound of Music shot in the love sequence on Naboo? I think even John Williams made reference to it in the first few notes of the score. So, i give it a 7. It really was a good movie, but they just don't make 'em like they used to. And that's another thing. One of the coolest things about the first three movies was the muppets. Why use computers just because you can? The CGI Yoda doesn't even compare to the muppet. I remember when i was little, I thought Yoda was a real little creature living in the swamp on Dagobah. Now, every little kid going to see Star Wars now will spot the CGI in an instant. I personally have more respect for the skill and ingenuity of making a puppet look real than for letting a computer do all the work.

"Much as I wanted them to be wrong, I couldn't help but give some credit to the reviews I'd read of this movie, which at best damned it with faint praise ('well, it's better than the last one...') and at worst dismissed it completely as an unfathomable, soulless exercise in expensive FX and bad acting.  Surely, even if they were overly critical, there must be some truth to these appraisals?  I enjoyed The Phantom Menace, but had to concede some of the points made by its detractors.  Would this be just another 'fun, but flawed' piece of sci-fi fluff?  I'd hoped for so much more, especially after Lord Of The Rings had delivered so spectacularly. Well... I'm not sure exactly how to put this... but not only was this film better than Fellowship Of The Ring, it may well be the best Star Wars film of them all.  I left the cinema dizzy with elation, hairs on end as they had been throughout the last 2½ hours.  Take your pick of superlatives - awe-inspiring, epic, captivating, enchanting, riveting, breathtaking, spectacularly beautiful... it is all of these and more.  The characters are solid and often intriguing - in Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi we have a classic action hero who could be the prototype Jedi; Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker is a complex, often brooding figure for whom we can all feel some empathy.  With his innocent beginnings, the descent into the Dark Side and eventual redemption which are to come, this phase of Anakin's life completes the cycle of classic tragic hero.  Natalie Portman makes Amidala into more than just a love interest, truly convincing as the future mother of Princess Leia.  The supporting cast is crammed with memorable performances, from the (very!) animated Yoda and the righteous Mace Windu to Jango Fett and the menacingly powerful Count Dooku.  The many worlds are bustling with all manner of alien life, charming and menacing at turns. The special effects... they need no introduction, except to say they are more convincing than computer generated images have ever been before.  Nothing breaks the spell. Were there any flaws?  I suppose there must have been.  Flaws as seen in the original trilogy, and as seen in Fellowship, and a thousand other films heaped with unconditional critical praise.  The critics must have had their own agenda in slating this film - I feel most sorry for those who claimed they couldn't follow the plot.  Perhaps they need to reconsider their choice of career, because the magic of cinema can rarely have been in such evidence as it is here - if it eludes you, it's your loss.",0.1632906894100924,0.5922767116796968
"I admit it wasn't as bad as the last movie but the movie is at best mediocre.

In Empire, we got two story lines, Han, Leia and gang and Luke and Yoda.  Again, Han just escapes from one scrape to another and Luke face Vader and loses.  Great stuff.  Jedi had three story lines.

"There are many reasons why ""Attack of the Clones"" is a classic piece of movie making, and, while it may have some faults - which are few and far between, by the way - it manages to hold your attention throughout. *SPOILERS* OK, where should I begin. The film begins with an attempt on the life of the now Senator Amidala which spawns the beginning of the end for the Republic. Obi Wan and his apprentice Anakin are appointed to protect the Senator from further attacks. AOTC contains numerous references to the original triology which are sure to please fans. Many of the original triology's mysteries and plot holes are filled in this installment, such as how Owen and Beru Lars came to be Luke's Aunt and Uncle. The transition of Anakin to the dark side is magnificently done with appropriately dark music accompanying the scenes as Anakin's emotions tear him appart and force him to give in to his anger. While those who say that the film's romantic plotline are exteremely poor are not wrong, it is not something which takes away from the film's enjoyability. The acting of these particular scenes, while not being astounding, is exceptionally good when you actually look at the script which they had to deal with. The acting is perfect otherwise with Ewan McGregor performing excellently as Obi Wan and Christopher Lee playing the villain, Count Doocu, brilliantly. Fans of the series will not be dissappointed with AOTC as it contains some marvellous visual effects taking full advantage of the new digital technology available. The road is well paved for the original triology's events with the newly created Clone Army bearing a striking resemblance to the Stormtroopers, telling us fans how they came to be. The transport ships at the end which come to take the Clones look a lot like the infamous Star Destroyers. My favourite homage to the originals is the inclusion of ""Jango Fett"", the father of the chilling ""Boba Fett"" from TESB and ROTJ. The scene in which he and Obi Wan share a spine-chilling conversation had so much suspense in it that I was glued to my seat. It was clear that both he and Obi knew who each other were, but neither wanted to act yet. I read someone say that it was stupid as Jango would have killed Obi on the spot, but they are wrong. We see that Jango cares deeply for his son, and he obviously did not want to put him in danger. Finally, for those of us who always wanted to see the true extent of Yoda's power, we are not left in the dark, as he gets fully involved in the action, hurling streams of lightning and running rings around Doocu with his lightsabre. This was one of the best scenes combined with the duels between Anakin, Obi Wan and Doocu, and of course, the MASSIVE fight sequence between the entire Jedi order with the Clones, taking on the joined might of the Trade Federation's army and numerous other evil armies. We see Mace Windu showing us his power with the incredible beheading of Jango, which was sad because I liked him. There really is too much great things in this movie to describe in a thousand words. So, I will just say, go and see it. While this film can not please everybody - the critics will obviously say so - it should please those of us who like to see lightsabres, the force, digitally enhanced scenery, a two foot tall killing machine (Yoda) and a whole lot more.",0.12790226205719163,0.5275537060748327
"** MILD SPOILERS **  Attack of the Clones was a darned sight better than Episode 1, and tried to regain some of the old formula (in particular, more one liners and better pacing), however it didn't quite get there.  The script was atrocious, especially the love story between Anakin and Amidala (""soft and smooth ..."" (the whole opening night audience cracked up on that one), or ""I'm haunted by the memory of the kiss you shouldn't have given me"", and was Anakin dreaming about his mother in that scene or was he ... I know Lucas wants us to believe he's engaging in modern myth-making, but Oedipus Rex?!?)

I was shocked at how bad this movie is. A significant proportion of the dialog was so awful and cheesy that I literally could not listen to it and was forced to put my hands over my ears. The direction was also very poor and unimaginative. The acting was wooden and far inferior to the performances of the original trilogy. The special effects looked like a video game and did not come close to the believability of the special effects of the original trilogy (I prefer models to CGI). The fight scenes were not as good as the Phantom Menace (who's fight scenes themselves weren't nearly as good as a decent kung-fu flick).

The usual quanta of colourfull aliens and ugly monsters [one of Episode one's good points] are also here and the film will have all Starwars fans grinning and gripping their arm-rests alternately.

"unfortunately, i came into this movie with unusually high expectations.  i will try and make this concise.  the plot was lengthy and slow.  the acting was rather poor.  anakin's lines were childish and whiny rather than tortured and misunderstood.  the love scenes were similarly weak.  anakin again came up short and appeared like a little boy with a obsessive crush rather than a young adult reuniting with his soulmate.  the movie consisted of drawn out action sequences that ended in an anticlimax.  the ten minute car chase scene and the ten minute run through the droid factory stand out in my mind as particularily large wastes of time and money.  i understand that the point of the movie was supposed to setup anakin's turn to the dark side, however, the film barely develops anakin as a character, much less a likeable character that the audience will identify with or sympathsize with. am i wrong or is anakin supposed to be a tragic hero?  i cant wait for him to fall into the molten lava pit and stop with the poorly acted and written lines.  oh yeah, the c3po ""humor"" was by far the worst part of the movie. i dont know why anyone over the age of 5 would see it as comic relief.  ewan mcgreggor was good and natalie portman was stunningly beautiful and decent. the rest of the cast is forgettable and detestable by turns.  i think less cgi, which the movie crammed down the viewer's throat at every turn, and more quality acting, plot development, and dialogue would have been a better use of the ungodly amounts of money lucas spent. all this movie did successfully lower the bar for episode three, further depreciate my respect for lucas a filmmaker and writer, and make me depressed about waiting another 4 years for a movie that will undoubtedly be just as poorly done. is it any wonder why my friends have lovingly dubbed this movie ""episode douche?""",-0.01732771970576847,0.48127951993805645

"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, George Lucas made some pretty decent movies. That time has long since past. I'd love to get into how terrible this piece of CG schlock was, but I wouldn't know where to begin. Let it to suffice to say that this film lacked three fundamental that made the first three films great: 1) story, 2) a charismatic villain, 3) likeable, interesting characters. I should also add coherence to that list. And this is coming from a writing instructor and published author who often holds up Star Wars as an excellent example of the Hero's Journey in action. I feel sorry for George in a way, because it seems there's no one around him brave enough to tell him his script sucks. Shame on you George Lucas for using the Star Wars brand to once again peddle a bunch of crap on an unsuspecting public. You know you have us all over an emotional barrel. Star Wars was such a big part of so many people's childhood experience, that you know we can't resist. Here's my advice to you: Think back to your days as a frustrated auteur under the tutelage of Francis Ford Coppola. The geek may have come out of the closet and earned the money of a mogul, but you're not half the storyteller he is. Stick to what you do best: visual effects, and for the love of God, please hire a screenwriter to write the script for Episode Three (I'm available by the way).

All these people saying that TPM and ATOC 'don't have the depth and emotion of the original three', I'm sorry but the Star Wars films are (and always have been) the epitome of saturday afternoon popcorn-munching flicks. Don't get me wrong, I love the original trilogy, (any films that can contain some of the appalling lines that they had and still be enjoyable has gotta be good) but they weren't these deep, philosophical masterpieces that everyone seems to think they were. I think the obvious reason for the hatred being thrown at these recent prequels is that most people saw the original three when they were children, so they remember them as being fantastic, whereas now they're grownups and expecting these ones to be just as good, but they can't be because people are now seeing them from an adults point of view.

"I was floored by Attack of the Clones, and can easily say that it is now in the top 2 favorite Star Wars movies for me.  I am not sure if I prefer Attack of the Clones or the Empire Strikes Back -- its that close.  I can honestly say that I have greatly enjoyed each of the Star Wars movies -- not because they gave me more of what the previous films gave, but because each one has covered new ground.  I have read a lot of the other reviews posted here by people slamming this movie (and its predecessor, The Phantom Menace, which ALSO rocked) and saying that it didn't live up to the interplay between Han, Luke & Leia from the classic trilogy.  News Flash:  This is 30 years before the original trilogy!  It is about TOTALLY DIFFERENT PEOPLE. It is asinine to expect the prequels to give us the exact same feel & chemistry as a group of characters who DO NOT EVEN APPEAR IN THIS PART OF THE STORY!!  Don't get me wrong -- Han, Luke & Leia were awesome in the classic trilogy, but Padme, Anakin and Obi-Wan are just as compelling if you give them a chance.  George Lucas has done an amazing job giving continuity with the classic trilogy.  He has also created interesting new characters, and is giving compelling reasons why Anakin is about to Darth out.  Attack of the Clones was technically superior to ALL of its predecessors, & the story completely lives up to the Star Wars name.  Perhaps the people who do nothing but lambast the film have built the original trilogy up so high in their minds that NOTHING George Lucas did would please them anyway.  The point of Star Wars is to sit back, enjoy the spectacle, & lose yourself in Lucas's Universe again, just like we did when we were children -- not to pick it apart because it wasn't custom made to YOUR perception of the classic movies.  As for the complaints over CGI, the special effects in the new trilogy are no more noticeable as artificial than the muppets & stop motion from the classics.  It is sad that so many people have COMPLETELY lost the childlike nature that Lucas's films are designed for.  I, for one, am not willing to let the modern world kill the wonderful escapism of Star Wars for me.  If you can watch this film without any preconceived notions, then you will enjoy it.  If not, then maybe you should ask yourself why you bother to go to the movies at all.  If you hate something because it doesn't give you more of the same, then perhaps you should stay home & watch re-runs.  Personally, I am glad that George Lucas has chosen to delve into new areas with the same eye for fantasy & detail that he has always had. Attack of the Clones is not only a worthy successor to the previous movies, it is an excellent film in its own right.  Give it a chance.",0.21122188079777368,0.5720990517419089

"I saw Star Wars episode II last night on digital projection and it looked unbelievable. I had a good time,but I think Lucas needs to bring in another writer for the next episode if not for the fact that the dialogue especially between anakin and padme was stiff and wooden. Christensen was terrible and not convincing as the arrogant young jedi. But I think a lot of the problem was he was miscast. Joaquin Phoenix as a young jedi would have been PERFECT. Even Portman,who is usually a great actress, looked stiff. Macgregor was good as Obi Wan and his sequences of investigating the planet Camino and finding out about the clones and Jango fett was fun. I wish Lucas had gone deeper into the Clones themselves and why Jango was the host for these clones. The fight scene between Jango and Obi Wan was awesome. Jango kicked butt and was one of the best parts of the movie. Really slick character. The flow was hurt by the budding romance scenes and not enough on the clones or Yoda.

"I watched Spiderman on its opening weekend and by half the movie I was ready to leave, it looked a copy of the Original Superman motion picture.  AOTC brings back the magic and myth of the original Trilogy, without leaving you the sense that it is a replica, and is almost as good, or tops, the Empire Strikes Back -- with two clear plots carrying over to the next prequel. The last 45 minutes looked more like only 10 minutes, time goes by that quick since it is that good! Not to mentioned that also right at the beginning you are jumped into action. Hayden Christensen carries to perfection Anakin's role --- anxious and impulsive, best reflected in his eyes. I am also glad Mindu (Samuel L Jackson) had more active screen time. George Lucas had the hard job of showing how the Republic looked before the raise of the Empire and the role of the Jedis in that ""old Republic"" and he clearly mastered it. After watching AOTC I came out of the movie convinced that ""Return of the Jedi"" is not named after Luke Skywalker come to mastering of the Force, but for Anakin (Darth Vader) conversion back to the light side of the Force.

This is the movie where we should have learned along with Amidala to love Anarkin. That would make his fall, that much more personal and involving.  He's not really very lovable here.

This movie is a barren land which has very very little to offer; special effects by themselves do not impress anybody anymore, and frankly I can't find any other particular interesting feature about this movie.

Starting the movie off ten years later was a great idea because the story itself has alot of time to cover and jumping the timeline so much wasn't a bad effect on the movie storyline.  The movie was full of drama as well as action in the sense of how the two stories intertwine with the coming of the Galactic Empire and the destruction of the Imperial Senate.

The way that he is already starting to be very defiant with the persons in which are teaching him the trade of the Jedi Knights.

He simply can't seem to follow up the orignal films and is making much worse films now so he can squeeze all the money he can out of the Star Wars brand. The love story that the film is centered around is awful. I couldn't help but laugh at parts of it. It really is that bad. Also the ultra crappy Jar-Jar Binks is back but in a much smaller role than that of Star Wars I. The good points of the movie are the fight scenes which are all great particually Joda at the end of the movie. In fact the end fight seems to drag the film out of the toilet bowl at the last minute.

"I was sooooo excited to see the new Star Wars movie, I really wanted it to be good despite all of the horrible reviews. Unfortunately I found myself laughing out loud through most of it, it was ridiculous. No pay off, no reward for the horrible acting and childish dialog. The writing must have been dumbed down significantly for kids. The acting, even by actors who are normally really good, was the worst I've ever seen. The 50's diner and characters, the Fifth Element city scenes, the advertising in city streets, the bar with sports games on monitors, the Arrival/AI/X-files aliens, etc...none of it looked or felt like the Star Wars universe developed in the previous movies. It just didn't feel like a Galaxy far, far, far away - it was like everything else we see in movies now. He just relied way too much on the 3D, which I didn't think was very good either. I still like the old models much better than 3D, you just can't get the same detail and lighting quality with 3D. The fight scene with Yoda was the only cool thing in the whole movie and it was very short. The battle sequence was one big cheesy 3D fest, and the jedi knight army wasn't much of an army. What happened to the much talked of jedi knight army in the original movies. This movie destroys all of the grandeur talked about in the original movies of the Clone Wars. The scenes with Anakin and Amadalla were just plain silly - ""Hi Annie, I love you and even though you just told me you slaughtered innocent women and children and liked it, I love you and want to marry you. Now lets go frolic in a meadow together."". The acting and writing in this movie, believe it or not, was worse than the garbage we were forced to sit through in Battlefield Earth. No depth or chemistry between any of the characters. I much prefer, despite Jar Jar and the little kid, Episode I. At least with Episode I they gave us great scenes like the beginning with Liam Neison and Ewen McGregor fighting together, the fight at the end with Darth Maul, the deathstar-like space battle at the end, etc. I'm just so upset with the crap he expects all of us to accept, especially now that we have new standards with The Lord of the Rings series.

"Overall, I enjoyed the movie.  But then, I have a bad habit of enjoying bad movies, so perhaps I can be excused... What I did not enjoy about this film was the acting - or rather, the lack of it.  In an effort to bring depth to their roles,  the actors have valiantly over-emoted and over-acted what minimal basis there is to base a character upon.  Ani is your stereotypical teenager, chafing at his chains of underdeveloped independence.  Padmè is also stereotypical, the strong woman who is eventually overwhelmed into love.  The bad guys are all very, very bad, and the good guys are all very, very good.  Except of course, Ani, who is a bit of both.  I can see what Lucas was trying for in his script, I really can, but in his bid for technology and digital imaging he has lost the very thing that made the original Star Wars episodes so appealing, the very humanity of the characaters.  Instead of Ben Kenobi as a man who has become wiser through the years, we are given an advice-spouting mother hen of a Jedi who can barely control his apprentice.  (Don't they learn about discipline in Jedi school?)  Instead of Luke we have Ani (whine for whine, question for question, they basically balance eachother out).  Instead of Leia we have Padmè, who near the end of the film shows some of her daughter's chutzpah, but then just falls back into ""I'm a female bossed around by men except when I'm really determined to do something utterly foolish"" mode. Yoda has turned from old wise guru to incredibly agile spinning-top type small guy with a short future.  Where is the equivalent of Han Solo and his trusty side-kick, Chewbacca?  There is no ""slightly on the wrong side of right"" guy for us to cheer with, jeer with, or just plain watch as he wreaks havoc amongst all his friends.  There is no risk-taker.  The two droids are among the best acted of the characters in this film, only because through the simplicity of their roles, they can't become more wooden (metal?).",0.05728128460686602,0.49607419712070866

As pretty as she is, Natalie Portman's princess has none of the fiestiness of Leia. Ewan Macgregor is completely wasted as many of his one-liners just don't hit the mark probably due to acting to a blue screen continuously.  We miss the wit of Harrison Ford and to be quite honest there is no ""baddie"" to touch Darth Vader. Darth Maul looked the part but he was taken out at the end of Menace.

All of the complaints I have read allude to the accuracy of a fictional story.  Come on!  It's visual popcorn.  And pretty good popcorn at that. None of us will ever have the same feeling about a Star Wars movie as we did about the first one.  Wouldn't we all love to see ""Raiders"" for the first time again.  But we can't.  Same with this.

Jackson, Yoda riding shotgun on a helicopter (will we be seeing him in the next Vietnam movie).  I thought the acting was great.

Unlike 'Empire Strikes Back' which was a brilliant masterpiece, this ""other"" middle movie is both lame and without content.  We have convenient plot twists, horrible acting, and action sequences that were all shown in the trailers and commercials.  Anyone trying to defend this dribble is obviously only trying not to spoil their perfect little vision of Star Wars movies being able to do no wrong.

No one should be subjected to this type of mind-numbing torment.  I just can't say enough about how awful this movie was.  Terrible doesn't even begin to describe it.

As with Jurassic Park, Terminator II,  and Blade Runner (seems to be an influence here)this movie would have been worth seeing from the special effects alone.  This is especially relevant as the dialogue does get clunky from time to time. It's a shame a small piece of the budget couldn't have gone towards getting more help on the screenplay, particularly with regard to the romance.  I mean really.

The original trilogy was meant for an adult audience. TPM was more of a kids' movie. Attack of the Clones was a high-paced action/romance story for the whole family.

I haven't even heard a 5 year old whine like he did in this movie.  ""Obi won is holding me back!  Obi won is jealous of me!""  I was waiting for obi won and anakin to get into a slapping fight at that scene with Padme.  Also, the plot was slow, considering the first half was almost nothing but Christensen and Portman sending back hollow emotion back and forth, (some of those lines were pathetic, ""I'm intoxicated by you""?????).  And I'm sorry, but the meadow scene with the two of them, I was waiting for them to break out with the lyrics to ""sound of music"".  SO, finally, after about an hour and a half, when they got to the clone army and all that stuff. Finally!  The film got good, and the classic star wars shown through.  The jedi fighting scene was spectacular and Yoda's fighting scene was great.  And needless to say, Natalie portman losing clothing progressively through the whole movie was a plus too.  The only complaint I have about the the last 45 minutes, was C-3PO.  There aren't words to describe how incredibally stupid his humor was, or attempt at it. 3PO's humor was pointed towards 7 and 8 year olds.  Overall, I give the film a 5/10.

However, the only thing I was disappointed in was not seeing some of the scenes that were cut out in the movie; many had important messages and critical dialogue.

"This film is a step-up from Episode I, but still suffers from many of the deficiencies present on the first film, including: pointless action scences, CGI overkill and poor character development. Character development is the basic cinematic tool that allows the audience to identify with the on-screen characters. It allows us to feel what they're feeling. Sadly, the attempt at development in this movie is a complete misfire. Thus, we bristle at the romance scenes between Portman and HC. As a guy, I had no feelings for NP, (whereas in the first Star Wars I felt myself falling for Leia). Portman, prettty as she may be, appears as a lifeless, smug, preachy character. HC is equally distasteful as a whiny, irritable teenie jedi. His horrific ""crocodile tears"" acting style makes the character all the more unappealing. Moreover, the romance between the two simply doesnt make sense. A grown woman is unlikely to fall in love with someone she basically reagraded as her kid brother, especially when this kid shows(albeit, very poorly) fits of demonic rage that is inconsistent with her angelic diplomatic ways. Other portions of the movie suffer from the same boring and confused plotlines  as did the first i.e the evil political machinations of the senate elite ( as well as the dull deliberations Jedi council). Sandwiched between these scenes are lifeless actions actions scenes that serve no purpose, really. A typical example of this is the final ""climactic"" light sabre scene. The scene is uninteresting to the viewer because the bad guy has only only been recently introduced into the movie when the scene occurs (kinda like darth maul in PM). We dont know much about and in fact, he doesnt really seem to be all that evil. The same applies to virtually all the other action scenes--and there are plenty. They simply do not engross the viewer and are neither compelling nor thrilling for that reason. Compare that to the opening scene in ""minority report"" where tom cruise has only several minutes to prevent a murder). The orgy of fighting between the jedi and the robots is as mechnical as the final battle scene in the first movie. Still, there are saving graces in this movie that make it a notch better than Ep.I: the fact that CGI characters do not dominate the scenes, better character development and the overall appearance that this movie is not primarily a kids movie.",-0.0880059523809524,0.5048086734693877

The creatures lack imagination, rather than originality they have just been made to look good. The sets and narrative style just don't hold that long time ago in a galaxy far, far away kind of atmosphere. In short everything is poorly done, suggesting to me that perhaps the production was quickly running close to deadline. To top it off is Yoda's lightsabre duel with Dooku. The master Jedi struggles to walk and yet manages all those unnecessary movements. In my opinion Yoda would be of the school of thought that less movement is paramount to an effective saber technique. Oh well, hopefully the third installment can capture some of the feeling of the originals and if not then episodes I through III should be stricken from the record.",0.0996376811594203,0.6157694962042789

"Star Wars, my favorite trilogy. The first trilogy that is (episode 4,5 and 6) cause the second (episode 1, 2 and almost 3) is just nothing compared to the first one. George Lucas never had to film these movies. These movies don't deserve the name Star Wars, cause it doesn't feel like Star Wars. I know, the movie has jedi's, the force, speeders and stuff like that, but it doesn't feel right, like if it misses a ingredient or something. That doesn't mean it's a bad movie, it's a nice science fiction movie with great special effects, but it's just a bad Star Wars movie. I never thought I would say this, but I'm disappointed in george.",0.04836309523809527,0.6078869047619048
"I watched the original star wars movie back in 1985, when I was a teenage girl in Hong Kong.

"I have just wasted 142 minuets on watching this pointless, mean-less and utter rubbish movie. I am not criticizing the actors or special effects, I will point my finger at George Lucas' bland script. The script is full of dialog that wouldn't of made a difference or affected the story line in any way at all, the actors because of the formal script and sound like robots, they are way to formal for a Star Wars movie. The relentless, pedantic dialog bores the audience not creating any tension. When i first watched this movie I actually wanted to leave the theater and was waiting for it to be over, that is not a good sign. The storyline my be solid and it often sticks to the point, but that would be the only praise I have on George Lucas' script. I honestly cannot wait to see how J.J Abrams does to rescue the Star Wars franchise. By watching the movie, I did not get a clear understanding of who the target audience is, I thought it was to complex for a 7 year old Star Wars fan to understand. Star Wars has a massive fan base, but George Lucas hasn't made anything that would impress a real Star Wars buff. The only way I can understand how the movie made so much money is because of its massive fan base, and not because of the quality of the movie. It is also to long until a good action sequence, it leaves the audience on the edge of their seats for too long and it must be obligatory for a Star Wars movie to have good action in it, or why call it a Star Wars movie at all? This movie has a few good/alright points, but in my opinion there are more bad points than good, making this a bad film.",0.02324929971988796,0.5324929971988797

"Attack of the Clones leaves a pit in your stomach when thought about. It's a horrendous mixture of green screen catastrophes, flat, boring shots, and grossly miswritten dialogue. Every time a character is on scene, it is a monstrosity to behold. Only when there is just CGI on the screen does it look good... for a Pixar movie. It is sad that this somewhat interesting story, told in all three prequels, was given such a disastrous execution. When people converse with one-another, whether it be a romantic scene or senate meeting, I feel like I could switch out the characters and CGI with daytime soap opera actors and sets and the scenes would make more sense. Mixing such a big budget with awful direction is disgusting. Every scene is so drab it hurts. Terrible.",-0.21911764705882353,0.6132352941176471

"This movie is an improvement over The Phantom Menace. But still it's not a good movie. There is too much CGI. Don't get me wrong, sometimes CGI can be done great, but certainly that's not the case. Yoda and the Geonosians looked like they were ripped off straight from the Clone Wars cartoon. I think that Hayden Christensen acted really weak, even weaker than Jake Lloyd in the Phantom Menace. I would say that the light saber battles between Yoda and Count Dooku, and The Anakiin/Obi-Wan battle against the Count were decent enough. Well there were things that just annoyed me like, when nobody suspected Palpatine, even after they were told to by Dooku or when Obi-Wan didn't see Jango's suit, which was behind the bounty hunter the whole time. I like that Jar Jar doesn't have that much of a screen time. Or else this movie would have been a train wreck",0.025425170068027223,0.5723639455782312
"Hayden Christiansen or whatever his name is - how can Anakin Skywalker like that turn into Darth Vader? Short, baby-faced, boring voice and boring personality. I've seen thousands like him in American movies. Plot. Where is a plot? That's the question. There is no plot; action and explosions instead of common sense. Obi Wan - why is he in this movie? He has nothing to do there, nobody has anything to do there. Characters are like made of paper, no flesh, no blood. This is a film without any artistic vision, how unlike Episode 4,5 and 6. Special effects are great but there are hundreds of movies every year based on computer tricks. Nothing new.",-0.07028728846910662,0.529634002361275
"I fell out of love with the prequels a long time ago in a cinema far far away but time has passed since my original viewing so I thought I would give them another go. The Phantom Menace I can forgive. It's got many many flaws and the narrative is rushed but as a stepping stone into a new trilogy it can be forgiven.
Watching Attack of The Clones, I forget how good it looks, and how impressive the battle scenes are. However what it can't be forgiven for is how much I hate Anakin Skywalker. I'm not having a go at Hayden Christensen as it has more to do with how it has been written rather than portrayed. But there's no sense of bond or, for want of a better word, bromance with Obi-Wan, which is exacerbated further in the third film. The entire time Anakin is on the screen I'm just wanting to the film to hurry up so he can become Darth Vader. Instead of showing off how talented and powerful he is, they seem to concentrate on the arrogance of the man. Therefore when he does succumb to the dark side there is no sense of loss and I think that is the biggest problem with Episodes II and III.
It's still worth a watch for the Star Wars fans but what it makes up for in style it lacks seriously in substance.",0.2322871572871573,0.6141053391053392
