581,When Star Wars came out in 1977 everybody predicted it was going to be a flop. Star Wars was supposed to be a 1976 Christmas movie but it had many technical problems which pushed the movie to be released to Summer of 1977. George Lucas was ready for the movie to fail so basically many of the heroes and villains had little backstory but George left little hints just in case. At the time sequels was still risky with only The Godfather and the Planet of the Apes to get sequels. Second 20 Century Fox was in deep financial trouble and only the president of the time Alan Ladd Jr. Had any faith in the movie. As for George Lucas he was not a great director although he did have American Graffiti as his major achievement.,-0.012500000000000004,0.39705882352941174

I asked my father if we were going to finally see it, and he casually responded, ""Maybe."" It seems my begging had paid off.",-0.25000000000000006,0.9333333333333333

This time, I was touched by lucas's background settings (compared to what I thought the trilogy was mediocre) and by the plot, music, special effects, and the last gold-medal scene almost made me cry.",-0.047619047619047616,0.546031746031746
1532,"When you get over the nostalgia (difficult, I know) and take a hard look at the facts - this movie displays: bad acting (with very few exceptions, namely Sir Alec Guinness), very mediocre directing, dated special effects, basic plot line (good against evil, final showdown, etc.), and very few redeeming qualities - perhaps the excellent score by John Williams.",-0.07889455782312924,0.5903401360544217

952,"Why do they speak English in a galaxy far away? Why is there gravity on ships in space? How do they travel far above the speed of light? And when the Death Star reaches Yavin why does it wait 20 minutes to destroy the Rebel base, giving the rebels time to attack and destroy the Death Star? Surely the Death Star could've just blown up the rebel base without waiting for it to come in range. Hell they could've blown up the red planet first if it was in the way. Even if they were overconfident and didn't believe the rebels posed a threat to them, the rebels could've all gotten into spaceships and fled the base since the Death Star gave them plenty of time to get away",-0.11153846153846156,0.5401709401709401
