1055,"It is difficult for me to evaluate the STAR WARS movies individually because each has been intended to be viewed as one whole saga. But EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH is a definite step-up from its last two flawed yet serviceable predecessors, THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES, respectively. Whereas the aforementioned prequels took their time to set up exposition, this one unfolds at such a fierce, kinetic pace that you'll be hanging on for dear life.",-0.08888888888888889,0.3851851851851852
1645,"I won't get into the same points the other user's tried to make about this movie. Yes the acting was bad. The dialog was terrible. Blah, blah, and so on. Maybe I've missed reading it on here, but no one seems to notice or maybe they just don't care about the lack of continuity in this whole story line. This was my biggest gripe with this film. The events we watch in ""Sith"" are laid out completely different in ""Return of the Jedi"". In ""Jedi"" Obi-wan tells Luke that Vader(Anikin) didn't know that his wife was pregnant. He also says, his mother took Leah to Aldaraan, and that Ben took Luke to live with his brother Owen on Tatooine. There is no mention at all in any of the new movies about Uncle Owen being Obi-wan's brother. For those of you who haven't seen the new movie, I won't go into detail why this story conflicts ""Sith"" but those of you who have seen it, you know what I mean. There is also a part in ""Jedi"" when Leah tells Luke that she remembers her mother. This might seem picky to some of you who read this, but I hate when history is rewritten just because it becomes convenient. If you don't believe me, Just watch the original version of ""Jedi"". Not the one that was revamped and repackaged, but the original VHS release before it was tampered with. I don't know if they're on there because I can't watch the new version. You can also look at the shooting script for ""Jedi"" on-line. Yes, I know that not all the dialog in it was used for the final cut, but compare it with the final cut and you'll see what I mean.

685,"All right, just returned from the cinema. Frankly, I didn't expect much of it. I went to watch it for the main reason that I've seen all SW movies around the time they came out so I wanted to watch the last one as well. But - what I didn't expect was that mind-numbing assault of unbelievably bad crap. The acting was in a galaxy far, far below any known standard, the dialogue made me grind my teeth (it was a true rival for the abysmal Blade III) and George Lucas' idea of tying up loose ends to connect EP III with IV is something very much like what a six-year old boy would think up. Every time Hayden Christensen attempted to put on an evil or angry facial expression I was forced to summon all strength not to explode with laughter. I could go on now for about an hour but I'll spare the eventual readers of this comment and myself the time. In summary, the movie was a waste of money.",-0.10602853287063814,0.4306111432427222

988,"I was six when I saw Star Wars (New Hope) in a movie theater. I remember going home after the movie and trying to move things with the force. I am very grateful for Lucas adding something magical to my childhood. A really good movie can do that. These last three Star Wars movies have done the opposite. They have sucked out the magic and replaced it with disgust and disdain. Why I think the movie/s sucked: 1. Poor acting: whether it was the actors, the script, or the director is irrelevant, the acting was lousy. 2. Special effects: they are supposed to augment a good story, especially in scifi, not take over the movie. 3. Horrible script: cheesy lines are not only annoying but distracting as well. 4. Political messages: I think Lucas was taking a stab at current politics. I watch movies to take a brake from reality. I do not care about the political opinions of a movie director.",-0.027567886658795757,0.5542109405745769

698,"This movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long. Herein lies 1 hour and 30 minutes of some of the worst dialog I have ever had the misfortune to witness (even worse then Stargate!), 35 minutes of classic Hollywood clichés (""She's dead, Annie""... ""Nooooooooooo...!!!!"") and about 15 minutes of some reasonably sufficient fight scenes. And sadly, that is the movie summarized in one run-on sentence! So, common... I must have at least one good thing to say about the movie, right? Yep, and here it is - At least Lucas didn't use racism for character development this time (nice use of the Cali-Surfer dude in place of your traditional Japanese accent for the ""evil, money grubbing"" Ferengi-esquire leaders of the robot army, George)! It seems that George had his (ex)wife for a muse when he wrote/directed the first trilogy. I guess she was the only one gutsy enough to say ""Agh, George, that sucks."" His story arch's are some of the best in the business (hell, that's really why everyone loves Star Wars, right?). And even in this tripe, those wonderful story arch's are there, yet they are hidden behind his pubescent attempt of ""dialog"" and ""character development"". Some of the story devices he uses are quite well done (such as how Palpatine manipulates control away from the Senate ""with thunderous applause"") while other devices are worse then pitiful (such as how Palpatine manipulates ""Annie"" into being a bad guy  ""What have I done!? {agh, all well, I guess I'm evil now} I'll do anything you want me to do Sith Lord"").",-0.09818289620535711,0.5686383928571429
2430,"I'm not going to say much, just as I was walking out of the theater, I was bewildered. I didn't have high expectations, and even those weren't met. Horrible script, horrible acting, horrible directing, horrible development, horrible plot, but some damn good cgi. But anyone should know that it takes all of the parts of a film coming together to make it great, not just overwhelming an audience with bright flashes and whizzing noises. I think I was more entertained by slumber party massacre two, which is slightly above this film...(wait, I meant two some hours of cgi). I have nothing else to say, this is merely to meet the minimum submission guidelines... yep. horrible movie. waste of time. I would have rather watched a five year old play with blocks.

1200,"It was bad enough when Lucas shoved the completely unbelievable notion that Luke was Darth Vader's son in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" down our throats (Hey, when did Darth realize this? A little after trying to kill him in the original movie?). But when he so clumsily tries to tie every loose end together in this horrible film I found myself shaking my head repeatedly in disbelief. Others here have detailed the litany of bad writing, bad acting, leaps of logic and bad direction and I agree. One other element that really bugged me here was the notion of space being incredibly crowded and noisy. See Kubrick's 2001 for a credible notion of the vastness of outer space. In this turkey it's more crowded and noisy that Time's Square at rush hour. Lucas shows no regard for any fan who had paid attention to any of the plot developments from the first three films and it shows. Of the many stupid things that Lucas expects us to swallow is that C3P0 AND R2D2 knew all the main characters generations ago, had superior abilities (apps?), and were not relegated to the scrap heap after a few years use. Hey, my cellphone becomes obsolete after a few months! I could go on and on but others here have done a fine job exposing Lucas' lack of respect for his fan base. But Lucas has laughed to the bank. In fact he may own the bank. We're all suckers for sure. How else can one justify the 7.7 rating?",-0.013231675731675697,0.5592527842527842

27,"When George Lucas announced over 10 years ago that he was going to make prequels to his original trilogy, this was the movie everyone was expecting. Everything that happens in this one chapter, ties together all the other 5 movies, completely. Starting with Episode I when Anakin Skywalker was a young child on Tatooine, a lot of what happens in that movie explains why he turns to the dark side. Anakins inability to let go of his past, and constantly worry about his mother, is a major factor that Sidious uses to turn him to the Dark Side of the Force.",-0.015277777777777779,0.38981481481481484

444,"Blinding action? Relentless pace? Over-the-top crap to me. Whatever happened to the simple moments, the light-hearted breaks, the banter? Putting it into the over-done, over-long opening alone doesn't cut it. And how is it possible that TEAMS of filmmakers working on the layer-on-layer-on-multiple-layer of FX in every frick'n scene could stand to watch those pathetically bad dialogue passages without one of them saying ""um, George -- this stuff is crap"". ""Love me like you did on Naboo...""? Vader going ""NOOOOOOooooo!""? Crap, all of it. Holy cow, I'm at a loss here to see how anyone can call this a good film. What's presented is non-stop battle, which folks can argue was the point of the episode, but where within Ep.III was the exciting chase/race scene, the tension of ""will the hyper-drive work"", the visual break the eye needs where a solo villain character marches slowly, menacingly toward its prey with nothing whizzing around it? Every scene is deliberately set in front of a large window or moving landscape solely for the purpose of allowing more effects to whiz by -- well enough is enough!! Sometimes movies just need to focus on characters for a few minutes, you know -- have them set in front of a static wall or something so you look at them... and in this one all we get of that is a few moments with Anakin/Padme mouthing awful love lines to each other (AWFUL!) and then the Jedi Council deliberating about Anakin -- yet again with all of Coruscant's traffic buzzing outside the window. Dammit George -- all that visual clutter just ruins things... and it makes me sleepy watching it all. Sleepy ain't supposed to happen in an action movie, but by the time the end was finally approaching I was zoned out and wishing it all to be over. Disappointing, disappointing, disappointing... ...and don't even get me started about the weaknesses in how it links to Ep.IV (an 18-20 year build time for the Death Star that began construction with no political rebels established yet not a single eventual rebel EVER knew of it's development in 18-20 years?

2607,"George Lucas' challenge with Epidsode III, was to force me to forget what I know, by pushing my emotions around and all the while keep the continuity of the rest of the films intact. I wanted to feel Anniken Skywalker's transformation into Darth Vader, not just see it. The guy's world as he's known it for the past twenty some odd years, is crumbling. I wanted him to get mad, sad, insane, sweet, etc. His two powerful moments were when he killed the younglins and when he roared: ""I hate you."" Lucas didn't even dare me to go to the dark side. I wanted to know why Anniken became Vader; what made him crack. I'm introduced to this new idea that the most potent power of the dark side is preventing death. So, Vader goes to the dark side to save Amidalla from dying in childbirth. When Amidalla dies, Lucas makes you feel horrible for Vader. Vader never achieves this crazy new power of keeping people alive, and it made me question the purpose of bringing it up in the first place. And Amidalla dies! In an emotional discussion in Episode VI, between Luke and his sister, Leia says she remembers her being beautiful and she remembers her smile. How is that possible if Amidalla dies! I wanted to see an even bigger uprising then there was in Episode II, and instead all the Jedi's around the entire galaxy got bitch slapped. Except for Yoda, Obi-One and the guy from L.A. Law. The only part of that sequence that moved me was when Yoda clutched his heart and dropped his cane in agony. I almost cried. But Lucas quickly altered my emotions toward another ""tie-up"" scene. Lucas got lazy. He new he had to tie everything together, so he threw everything into this last movie, battle after battle, sequence after sequence, in an attempt to give the viewers some closure.
