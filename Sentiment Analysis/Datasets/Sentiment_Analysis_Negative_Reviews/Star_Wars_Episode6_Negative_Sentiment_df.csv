211,"Hello There, Dear Reader ! Let me say that ""regular"" reviews are kinda boring nowadays, so... let me tell you some FACTS, OK ?

446,"Luke Skywalker (Hamill) and his friends journey to the desert planet Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (Ford) from the evil crime-lord Jabba the Hutt before the final confrontation with the evil Empire. A three-way battle (space, forest and lightsabers) closes the narrative of the most famous saga in cinema history.",-0.2,0.9
195,"The closer in the central trilogy (episodes IV, V, VI of IX) was widely regarded as the weakest of the three ""Star Wars"" films, and it's fairly obvious why. Being highly melodramatic, weakly plotted and poorly acted means ""Jedi"" fails to inspire at crucial times where ""Empire"" succeeded. Especially disappointing is Luke's confrontation with the Emperor, who in truth is a rather drab villain.",-0.24611111111111109,0.5794444444444444
610,"I'm afraid I have to say that Return of the Jedi is a shameful end to the trilogy. Not only is it far too cheerful, but the storyline was rushed and weak, the acting was appalling, the spaceships were uninspiringly filmed, the end sequence was cheesy to the extreme, the aliens looked rather....well, they were really bad. There is one redeeming feature...the speederbike sequence is good, even better than the Starwars trench scene. Other than that, I was disappointed.",-0.08833333333333333,0.7211111111111111
