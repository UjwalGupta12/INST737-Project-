7049,"Star Wars appears to have become a vehicle for a forced agenda and not about great story telling. The Last Jedi was horribly filmed, the transitions between scenes and the attempts at forced humor and light heartedness are akin more to a sitcom. The endless parade of characters that don't matter appears to be agenda driven. This film is 2 1/2 hours long yet every scene appears rushed because they force too much in. How they treated the character of Luke Skywalker was horrible and I have to agree with Mark Hamill's comments entirely - its like they re-wrote his character.. Just poor choices. People are too happy in this movie in the face of loss and struggle and it just feels like everyone is doing the motions to create the film so Disney can sell a lot of cheap plastic toys. Just very very sad, I was so very disappointed. The villains inspired zero fear and were so subdued - no way Kylo-Ren or Snoke could survive in the constant battle for power the Empire is known for, not based on what we saw. This movie just seemed cheap and the forced addition of characters seems more about Disney wanting the franchise to appeal to a larger market. The character of Rose -- I felt like she was acting in another movie, it felt like she was completely disconnected from what was going on and the film she was in... She just sucked big time, her lines were child like and simple, her character had no real depth and they have to stop filling the Star Wars universe with animated characters like Maz Kanata they are tacky to say the least. The emotion in this film was not there and the focus was lacking. Star Wars is supposed to be space opera where was the amazing musical score -- it was so passive and they didn't feature it properly?? This guy Rian Johnson who is directing is not a hot commodity he is a low budget guy with a weak film making history. Just very sad disappointing film.",-0.057894736842105256,0.5293546365914787

I didn't want to watch it, however it started on TV and I decided, that I owe that much to the story, I was in love with, when I was a kid. But the catch is, this has nothing to do with it. It just uses the same names for things, however they are now some shallow and useless words - the Force, Jedi Knight, Rebels, Empire (First Order) and so on - even space jump doesn't work the same. Just an example - we have Kylo Ren - the powerful apprentice of the mysterious Dark Force lord (mysterious because we never get to know who he is, what he did to become Lord of the First Order and why is he actually this powerful - or actually not powerful). So we can only compare Kylo to Vader, but guess what - he barely manages to kick the asses of some non-force users with semi-light-saber stupid weapons. Can you imagine non-force user stand more than 2 seconds against Darth Vader? There are scenes that are frustrating, there are scenes, that are simply stupid, characters have no depth, nobody knows what a character will do, which Disney seem to think is interesting.

This movie was like a terrible fan fiction written by a prequel fan. 3 hours watching a film where there is no progression in the overarching story of the franchise since 7 and works to negate anything interesting set up 2 years ago now. So disappointing that JJ didnt stay on to continue the same light but serious and mysterious tone of 7. Instead handed to a man who has no understanding of subtlety. Jumping the shark over and over again until those blue credits you have come to love so much roll and you are left relieved it is all over.
It feels like with the abundance of fantastic and genuinely surprising stories from the Expanded universe Brian Johnson and Disney thought looking for something so ridiculous and insulting to true star wars lovers would be the only way to create something edgy and original. WRONG!
There was so much potential here for this story and characters and now someone who has been a huge consumer and absolute fanatic from the first time he watched Star wars as a small child.

Many plot holes, poor dialogue and surprisingly poor acting from some great actors, boring story of little consequence, boring characters with zero chemistry (makes you appreciate Padme and Anakin's relationship). Kylo and Rey gave us a little glimmer of hope but eventually both journeyed to the boring side. Even the sets made the movie feel claustrophobic unlike say Rogue One which made tremendous use of its locations...
I appreciate the inclusive and socially relevant message this movie was imbued with. But even that is not sufficient to transform this clunky movie, or any clunky movie, into something good. Case in point: I like Rey a lot and I like girl power. But even Rey got lost somewhere in this movie which lacked a center and a purpose.
