194,"Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Peter Mahew, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Frank Oz and Alec Guiness star in this 1980 sci-fi sequel. This chapter starts off with Luke Skywalker (Hamill), Han Solo (Ford), Leia Organa (Fisher) Chewbacca (Mahew), C-3P0 (Daniels) and R2-D2 (Baker) on an icy planet, Hoth. Luke gets hurt while trying to locate a meteor and sees a vision of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi (Guiness) telling him to go to a planet, the Dagobah System where old Jedi master, Yoda will train him. Soon, Han finds Luke and they're rescued by rebel pilots who take them back to the base where Luke is nursed back to health. When Vader finds their base, they escape and head to Cloud City, where Han's old pal, Lando Calrissian (Williams) lives. Luke goes to the Dagobah System and soon meets Yoda (Voiced by Oz) beginning his training while his friends become Lando's guests learning that they're used as Vader's bait to lure Luke to the dark side. When Luke senses his friends in trouble, he attempts to rescue them and confronts Vader. I recommend this great Star Wars follow-up.",-0.10499999999999998,0.385
1311,"What can I tell about this Fifth episode of the so famous trilogy of Star Wars! This part contains a big dramatic aspect (with the Lando affair and the run after Han) that gives so much feeling. You want to cry to kill the bad Lando, to Scream like Chewbacca and to say with Luke ... ""No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!"".  I think any of Star Wars episode provide so much of feeling than ESB and that's why It is MY best episode of that Star Wars trilogy of mine. Hope that episode 2 and 3 will be of that quality!",-0.017824074074074048,0.5240740740740741

1292,"It took the release of the worst, most disappointing film of all time (The Phantom Menace) for me to realize that ESB is my favorite movie of all time. Aside from the great story, characters, acting, dialogue, art direction, etc. etc. etc. -- it is simply the most primal, mythic, formative movie of my childhood. No movie has ever captured good vs. evil so well. Let's hope Lucas can make Episodes 2 and 3 somewhat closer to ESB and further from the awful crap of Phantom Menace.",-0.1076923076923077,0.6697802197802198
