I know that everything is going down the tubes, that the republic is doomed, and that several characters I would really like to see come out 'right', are going to go horribly 'wrong'.",-0.03396825396825398,0.3849206349206349

555,"It's better than Episode I but this doesn't mean much. The plot have some substance, it is interesting and add something to the saga, but is bad executed. Whiny Anakin is just too much, i'm not sure if this is Hayden's fault or George Lucas bad writing, the character ended up being unlikable with all that stupid dialogue, this movie could have been better if those corny romance scenes had been toned down. It also has cool fight scenes, Obi Wan is the best character of this movie, Yoda fighting is stupid but it's kinda entertaining once you don't take it seriously.

Although the movie takes a bit of a slow start, it is really captivating and delivers in a fulfilling and clever manner. The only problem I encountered is a scene in the middle of the movie whose only point seems to be to prepare for the video game... Otherwise The Movie Rocked! Go! Go!

2220,"Is how I would describe Natilie Porman's acting.  No offence to the ""talented"" young actress, but I could not believe I was watching.  Its like they had a specific spot off in the distance somewhere and told her to stare at in and deliver her lines with as little personality as possible.  How is Padme?  Unless in episode 3, it is discoverd that she is a robot or a clone. This is just one exmple I picked of how aweful this movie is.  Is is emotionaless, dull, unoriginal, painful.   Natialie Portmans acting is a microcosm for what the movie stands for.

From a story standpoint, it is muddled at best, and excruciatingly scattered at worst.  As opposed to focusing on the interaction between a few main characters in the film, Attack of the Clones instead blazes through a large number of meaningless character interaction.  The only sustained interaction is between Padme and Anakin Skywalker, and even this is campy, uninteresting, and aggravating.

359,"Easily the worst in the SW franchise. No real character development, for anyone, and all characters are one-dimensional and dull. Even the passion from Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid fails to come through on screen - largely due to a poor script. CGI was unnecessarily forced, and it holds up the least of all the films by today's standards. Anakin's romance didn't hold me, and the film was oversaturated with lightsabers everywhere. In the originals, (and sequels), lightsabers were treats for the audience. Here, the tradition was broken hardest, in having the sheer volume of them on-screen at once.
The film also lacks any stand out moment, that all the other films have: Maul and pod racing from TPM; the transformation scene in ROTS; the trench run in ANH; Vader's reveal in ESB; the duel in ROTJ; Han's death in TFA; and Luke's death in TLJ. 
The only redeeming factor, is that it gave us some quality memes.",-0.18630952380952379,0.5380952380952382
3366,With the myriad of terrible things you could point out from this movie the thing that stands out the most for me is the terrible character development of Anakin Skywalker. I don't know if it is a result of bad acting or bad direction but Anakin never seems to be truly good nor a friend of Obi-Wan's. I found this a little disturbing because in the OTC Obi-wan points out that Anakin was a good man and friend. For me I think what would have remotely helped this film would be to show Anakin as good person with a bad temper. I think a lot of us know people like that. People who are in essence good but have conflicting emotions and inner battles that causes them to do impulsive things. Anakin in this movie does a lot of impulsive things but without any trace of good character. Overall he just appears as the wannabe bad boy of a boy band.,-0.0881944444444444,0.5462962962962963

Natalie Portman is terrible she could not act herself out of a paper bag.  Her character was totally unbelievable, a senator who looked 13, giggled while making puppy love to a leading man who was supposed to be many years her junior and looked many years older than her.

2089,Haven't watched it for a second time until today. It's amazing how bad it is. It was basically filmed entirely in front of green screens and it shows. It looks so bad. The effects are bad and you really see that the actors had nothing to act with or move on. And then Anakin. That's got to be the worst acting to ever put on film,-0.24999999999999992,0.5025

375,"My comment about THE PHANTOM MENACE began thus: ""This movie is so unbelievably bad, it is almost unwatchable."" Upon returning from the theatre on opening day of this execrable fiasco, my friend asked me what I thought of it. I answered, ""Remember when I said The Phantom Menace was the worst movie of all time? Well, we have a new champion."" Lucas seems bent on redefining the movie-going experience as neither entertaining, thoughtful, uplifting nor fun. I have seen both of the first two ""new"" Star Wars movies, and could not tell you right now what the two sides are, or what they are fighting about. He has turned the battle for good and evil into a CGI version of a 3-hour John Kerry lecture about ""nuance."" This leads to the worst sin a movie (which is entertainment, after all) can commit - it is BORING. Where is the genius that brought us American Graffiti and the original STAR WARS trilogy?

1786,"I'm sorry, but this film featured some of the worst screen performances I have seen since ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"".  The acting by the two leads, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, is laughable, and many in the audience I saw it with did just that.  It was that pathetic.  Even Ewan McGregor, who normally is a fine actor, fell on his face with his leaden lines.  You could hear his attempts at humor falling like so much dead weight in the silence of the audience.  While the story in general is interesting and it's fun to see how all the pieces fall into place, the absolutely amateurish quality of the writing can't be covered up by any amount of special effects (which, though excellent, are as usual way overdone).  If you must go see this, go with low or no expectations, and you won't be disappointed.  If, however, you really don't want to waste your money on making George even wealthier with no payoff for you, then go rent ""Dark Star"" by John Carpenter to see how to make an excellent, hilarious movie with no budget at all.",-0.014182194616977253,0.5712215320910974

3235,"I was so glad that I read the reviews of this film before I went to see the movie.  I purposefully anticipated horrible acting and two-dimensional characters along with some corny jokes and bad lines.  When I emerged from the theater nearly two and a half hours later, I was pleasantly surprised because it wasn't that bad!  Sure it had it's moments, but doesn't EVERY Star Wars film?  This installment blows Phantom Menace out of the water in every way!  The story itself is becoming much more complex than I had ever imagined.  I am more intrigued by the evolving story of how the Empire came to power rather than I am of the fall of Anakin.  This movie had many subtle and not so subtle references of things to come.  Along with some trademark quotes from the Star Wars franchise, such as ""I've got a bad feeling about this!"" and the most intense fighting scenes ever in ANY Star Wars film, Attack of the Clones has brought back that Lucas magic that he perfected 25 years ago.",-0.008680555555555533,0.5502314814814815

The only truly interesting aspect of Attack of the Clones is how _force_fully it proves the fact that special effects cannot make up for a poor (awful!!) story.  In this case, not only is the screenplay poorly written and the acting terrible, but the story elements themselves make absolutely no sense.  The plot failings are so strong as to spoil any assistance the special effects might have rendered.
