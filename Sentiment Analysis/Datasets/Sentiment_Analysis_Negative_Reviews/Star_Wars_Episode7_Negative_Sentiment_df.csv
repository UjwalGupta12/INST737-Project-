1035,"The film is more or less a remake of part IV. The villain is pale in comparison to the other villains we saw before. Why he is wearing a mask is not obvious and is totally useless. The crowd in the cinema laughed at the final reveal of the face, an emotion the director of the film hasn't planned for that scene. The whole overall story is so useless and boring I can't believe that has passed the quality control. The film was watchable up to a certain point on a bridge in the converter building. After that it was over for me. I won't go into details but how in the hell could they do that? Is this the Star Wars for the New Age? Forget that for me then. All in all uninspiring and boring with great but no many overblown special effects. More a mishmash of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and old Star Wars....Last but not least: who came up with the names? What was that villains name? Snoke? Snake? Snape? Doesn't care a lot for it.....",-0.0044702123273551745,0.4556699649556792

26,"So many possibilities to tell stories following the event after killing the Emperor and Darth Vader in Episode VI - and what they opted for!? A re-telling of Episode IV (a lost droid with a ofc important map in his memory, a deathstar again blabla). This is now the 3rd destroyed Deathstar - the engineers of the imperial troops seems to me are not very capable of learning how to secure a Deathstar and the script-writers are in an immense lack of imagination or not daring or probably both. This time a whole planet is the gun - what's next!? Must the rebells/resistance destroy a whole galaxy to get rid of the 4th Deathstar!? Also what I don't like are the zillions of inconsistencies here - no cameras or motion trackers on the base, all the gates and doors open, u just have to push the button or walk through the ofc open gates, and remember the base is a whole planet but ofc the heroes just stumble over each other. Or all the intel the storm-trooper-traitor got about the Deathstar - I mean he was just a storm-trooper of low rank, how the f*** he would know how to bring a planetsized-weapon down!? So in a meeting this dude just says - ah you need a plan how to kill that thing!? Easy! And on top they take a captain of the stormtroopers hostage and she just shut down the shield, and no other commando-post is able to override the shutdown!? It's just ridiculous the more you think about it. Or the scene where the Millennium Falcon is (re)entered by Han Solo and Chewie- looks like the universe is a small neighborhood. Even in my hometown I wouldn't run by coincidence over one of my old cars... Really I try to think of sth I like in this movie - and there is nothing. literally nothing. i don't like all the ""humoresk"" comments through the whole movie, I don't like that every scene has a equivalent scene in one of the old movies, the acting is mediocre, the action is mediocre, everything is predictable, the dialogs - well, never were a strength of the Star Wars movies. Rethinking all the fuss about Star Wars imo there are only two decent movies at all: IV and V, with VI (the Ewoks...) the decline already began. Episode I to III were stuff made for kids (I mean little kids)- droids with humor and afraid of being shot I expect and enjoy (!) in comedy-movies like Wall-E - but not in a sci-fi context like Star Wars. Only III of that trilogy wasn't too bad. So if u didn't see VII already - wait till u can stream it or buy/lend on DVD (wait till its cheap), in a cinema I will never go again to watch a Star Wars movie. JJ Abrams did a great jobs with the 2 Star Trek movies and I hoped he would do great stuff again - but with this work he did a bad job. I know, I know he didn't wrote the script but he got enough influence to put the Star Trek franchise on the next level, why not Star Wars!? Well, how its done Miller showed with Mad Max Fury Road - I had to watch that one 3 times in a row - but this one I will never watch again.",-0.020098824786324774,0.5315857753357754

774,"This is the worst movie of the franchise, and its worst offense is how it diminished the importance of the Jedi. Until now, the Star Wars universe has centered on the Jedi and Sith facing off in epic battles for control of the universe. The lightsaber battles between each side's masters were what we all waited for in every movie. For TFA to show an ex-Stormtrooper and a young civilian, both with no Force or lightsaber training whatsoever, fighting the primary villain to a draw is a absurd disgrace to the franchise. They should not have stood a chance against Kylo, who was trained to some extent by Luke Skywalker himself. The only sensible sequence would be for Kylo to toy with them and try to enrage Rey to facilitate turning her to the Dark Side...but that didn't happen - as it was shown, Rey could have actually defeated Kylo. It is a farce and completely ruined an already severely damaged movie. ",-0.2136363636363636,0.6090909090909091
