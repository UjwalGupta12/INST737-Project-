1007,"From the opening epilogue about a trade embargo (yawn) to the awful CGI and overuse of green screen which means none of the actors are looking where they are supposed to, this is still by far the worst film in the series. The whole story is dull and enough has been said about JarJar already. See Peter Serafinowicz (who did Darth Mauls voice) take online for the funniest and most accurate breakdown of the whole travesty.",-0.10916666666666663,0.6233333333333333
785,"...I can no longer say that ""The Phantom Menace"" is my least favorite Star Wars movie. There's still a lot about TPM that I don't care for, but at least it felt like it belonged in the Star Wars Universe. ""Ruin"" Johnson's TLJ film reflected his audacity and abuse of carte blanche (no thanks to Kathleen Kennedy and Disney) to just make it up as HE wanted with no respect for the Star Wars continuity and canon.",-0.049999999999999996,0.49999999999999994
2382,"After 3 years I finally managed to sit thru the whole movie. I stopped watching the movie the first time at the pod chase because I could not just bear to listen to Jar Jar anymore. Lucas should be flogged for ruining a movie and wasting money like that. Yes it's true Lucas has used children's characters like the Ewoks, but nothing in any movie by any director I have ever seen is ANNOYING as having to listen to Jar Jar. He doesn't even make sense. You just pick out a few words from each sentence cause that's all that makes sense. It distracts from the whole movie. Ewoks were for the kiddies but they just squealed or whatever. Jar Jar is by far the worst character ever.",-0.1,0.6425925925925926
3261,"A solid film, with several big problems. Firstly Jar Jar is the most irritating character in cinema history (well, at least since Chris Tucker's last film role). This kind of brain-damaged Teletubbie-esque amphibian is obviously aimed at the kiddies, and makes all but the least cynical of adults grind their teeth with hate.

2480,"An average rating of 8? Are you kidding me? Phantom Menace has some of the worst dialogue ever..I don't understand how the actors kept straight faces saying some of the things they did.  Even with the prodigious acting talent of Neeson and McGregor, the lines still came off sounding completely ridiculous.  And the character of Jar Jar...just that alone ruined the movie for me.  I was even a little insulted by the stereotype the character seemed to portray. not only does Jar Jar stereotype black people, the viceroys were a nasty stereotype of asians, and Anakin's owner, the shop-keeper, was an offensive characterization of latin people.  George Lucas' style of directing and his falir for screenwriting is completely dated, and so is Star Wars.

1297,"Ok so I know a lot of you hate The Last Jedi and I certainly ain't gonna argue with you guys on that but it certainly is better than this steaming pile of Gungan dudu no matter how you slice it. If George Lucas had some kind of coherent story arc for how Anakin Skywalker turned to the dark side we didn't need to sit through 2 hours and 13 minutes of kid Vader going through his child banter, quips and going has.
Visually this is not good either. For a guy who was waiting for the technology to catch up to his vision the CGI here looks worse than either Terminator 2 or Jurassic Park.
Well we all collectively hate Jar Jar Binksso let's not even bother going into what a disaster he was. The Gungans were awful and the pod race as pointless as the Harry Potter quidditch match.
Darth Maul was cool as was the political intrigue around Senator Palpatine.
This was a hot mess and a poor start to a trilogy we'd waited 20 years for. It only gets a six rating from me cause of Darth Maul and some of the performances in it.",-0.0705357142857143,0.5756547619047618

2034,"I don't need to watch this movie to know it sucks. Anything remotely related to Star Wars is incredibly boring and about as much fun as removing your own kidney with a blunt steak knife. It's just a show for little boys (or older boys who haven't grown up yet as is so often the case) who are impressed by light sabres and lasers and other such pathetic imaginary weapons.

1233,"Oh yes, this is the worst prequel and needless to say the worst Star Wars film overall . George Lucas was aiming for the stars with this new take on the saga, however he never even took off and he failed to meet fan expectation for the most part.

1875,I think that the only bad thing about the Phantom Menace is that Darth Maul and Qui Gon died in the same scene. I just think that Locus should've saved Maul for Episode 2 and had Dooku fight Qui Gon and Kenobi.

Many of the creatures are CG animations and they all feel out of place.  The interaction between the real-life actors and the animated creatures looks fake.  It's incredibly embarrassing.  And just about every scene contains the hyper annoying Jar Jar Binks.  He really ruins every scene he's in.  It's ""Meesaa!""  this and ""Meesaa!"" that.  He trips over everything and makes the whole film unpleasant to watch.  And why does every alien have an earth-type accent?  It makes absolutely no sense at all.

3944,"I was very disappointed in this movie.  I LOVE the first three films, seen them a million times, got the videos, watch them when they're on the tube... and this movie DOES NOT live up to their legacy.  The plot is paper thin... the characters are almost transparent... The action, such as it is, is predictable. They spent 11 minutes (might have been 13, I've forgotten, but I timed it) on the ""pod race"" which had a VERY minimal impact on the plot (what plot?), when the main point of the thing could have been handled in about 3-5 minutes.  Those other 6-8 minutes could have been used to give some substance to the characters. I'm forced to wonder if Liam made them mad?  His character was a cardboard cut-out, apparently designed to be killed for effect, so that Obi-Wan could go on alone.  Darth Maul was even more ephemeral.  He didn't even have a voice, or so it seemed.  He was apparently there to kill Liam and then be gone.  Definitely the weakest link! Yoda and the ""council"" of the Jedi Knights could have used a few minutes of air time to make us believe that they did anything other than say ""no"" to Liam (which, of course, he ignored).  Is Samuel L. Jackson scheduled to show up in future episodes? (I didn't see his name on the credits for Episode II on this site). And Jar Jar Binks???? What a waste of make-up!!!  Question... Why didn't he look anything like the rest of his people???  Why did he appear to be a cross between ""Old Weird Harold"" from the Cosby Kids and ""Roger Rabbit""?

2968,"I'll keep it brief - I WAS a fan of Star Wars. Any one who says this movie is a masterpiece clearly has no right reviewing films. This ""film"", if I can call it that, is more calculated and commercial than any piece-of-garbage summer flick to come down the pipe in quite some time. It almost makes Godzilla look heartfelt. Lucas has sold out big time, not that he hadn't done so earlier, but this is really reaching new lows. Perhaps George should take a little time to examine why he started making films so long ago. Make a statement, for God's sake put your heart fully into something. What do the words ""Jar-Jar"" mean to you, well thats the entire movie as far as I'm concerned. The Phantom Menace is ""Jar-Jar"". One big fake cartoon made to entertain the slow-witted and create toy-consuming zombies of us all.

The whole genre would have never got off the ground at all because of the special effects that would have been required to have pulled it off. All in all though this movie was a bore.  Totally predictable and without a lot of suspense.  With any luck Jar Jar Binks will get zapped in the second episode.

I'm not saying you have to like it.

""Anakin was annoying""  Youre just jealous youre not in the movie.  ""It was boring, so slow, it didn't go anywhere""  Where do you want it to go?  You know the ending, YOU try to tell a story after someone has told the outcome, that is what Lucas had to do, give the man a break.  Ok, Jar Jar could be annoying, Second time I saw the movie, he grew on me.

One is explanations. Obviously this movie was made after the OT, but I felt it was supposed to be presented as the first one. A lot of things, such as lightsabers and mind tricks, are not explained and may confuse people. Second is acting. I actually don't see too much wrong with this, but here and there Jake Lloyd delivers a bad line, as well as his friends and such. Third is the corny parts. Examples are JarJar's battle scene and a bit of Anakin flying his starfighter to save the day. But all three things aren't too bad, and I only wish the IMDb offered 9.5 stars, because I just can't give it a 10. Oh well, a 9 is still an A.",-0.11574074074074073,0.48148148148148157

No, Jar Jar doesn't bother me in the slightest, my gripe boils down to the script which i found to be both lazy (phantom is just a remake of Jedi, and New Hope, exactly the same things happen in three star wars movies now), and contradictory to the original films which maintain that Yoda taught Obi wan, not Quai Gon Who? One of the most irritating parts was the science, blood tests and midi clorians (excuse the spelling) seem so out of place in star wars, explaining ""the force"", and Jedi in this way is akin to dissecting dragons and unicorns.
