1962,"This movie is a disgrace to the star wars franchise. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece considering both the last jedi and the force awakens were pretty much unwatchable, but I managed to be twenty times more shocked and disgusted with this movie than I ever expected to be. I could have gone my entire life without that Kylo Ren makeout scene. Pretty sure the whole theater heard me gag. And while we're at it, let's discuss that Carrie Fisher tribute. Some tribute that was. Killing Leia off and having her vanish into mid-air? for what? So we can watch these mediocre, shallow characters that nobody cares about run around in circles fighting each other for five minutes and then hopping to the next planet to fight again and again and again? By the time the end credits started rolling, I felt like I was being put out of my misery. Real star wars fans know that this movie is nothing but a steaming pile of garbage. It doesn't feel like star wars anymore, if that makes sense. The prequels may not be the best movies ever made, but at least they have that classic star wars feel. This movie doesn't. The characters are dull. The saber battles suck. The dialogue is dreadful. The villain is useless. The twist is lame. The ending was the best part because that meant I was finally about to be free of the torture.",-0.02628205128205127,0.5566239316239318

Bitter dissapointment.
Absolutely mediocre movie.

We got the most pointless movie of the most pointless trilogy in the history of cinema. An exceptional failure of titanic proportions . This one had it all. A lazy empty headed script. A flimsy convoluted story with preposterous character motivations. Flat, boring , annoying characters. The originality of a volcano project at a science fair. A complex weave of horrendous flaws all being perpetuated by Disney itself. Why was JJ Abrams not under contract to direct all three films? Why weren't the writers made to create a script of all three films initially to ensure continuity? An absolute sham.

7482,"I am a serious Star Wars fan and this movie was, like the rest of this new trilogy, a major disappointment. It felt rushed, sloppy, and overdone. It is clear Disney didn't make any plan before they started making Star Wars movies and it is even more evident they don't understand their viewers. Most of this movie doesn't make sense and feels a bit like the last season of Game of Thrones.
I've decided to forget the Disney trilogy ever happened.",-0.01828512396694214,0.4428374655647383

1845,"I've been a Star Wars fan from the first trilogy that I've watched when I was 7 or 8. It was a simple yet powerful story, greatly entertaining but always - from the very beginning - with major flaws. I've always thought that it was a common thing among fans to just accept these flaws and go with it. Some great work has been done in the extended universe with the comics and recently the series ""The Mandalorian"", but when it comes to the trilogies, no masterpiece was ever there. It's always been a patchwork of inspirations with no original content but it worked with its simplicity and universality, and sometimes, with true moments of greatness. That's the way I've always considered Star Wars.
If there is anyone to blame for the uselessness of The Rise of Skywalker, it's neither Disney, Rian Johnson or J J Abrams but the hardcore fans. The Force Awakens was not appreciated because it resembled too much of the original trilogy, The Last Jedi was hated because it had the b*lls to make something different and now The Rise Of Skywalker is hated because no creative choices were taken to make everyone happy ! It is the worst Star Wars in the entire saga because, yeah, everything that's supposed to happen, happens. That's it. No surprises whatsoever, no true moment of greatness, but a predictable plot filled with nostalgia and fan service as if to answer ""We're sorry, it won't happen again !"" to the outcry of The Last Jedi.

THE FORCE AWAKENS had some potential, then THE LAST JEDI took a huge dump all over that, and now THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is just an absolute mess that tries desperately to dazzle everyone with huge action, bad humor, and sickening amounts of member-berries. the Skywalker Saga began with THE PHANTOM MENACE and ended with RETURN OF THE JEDI. this Disney Trilogy is meaningless. they resurrected Palpatine just so that Mary Sue could kill him again, which makes Anakin's redemption and sacrifice completely worthless. they're trying to tell us that Rey is the ""real"" Chosen One, but she has no character, no arc, no hero's journey, no depth, nothing that makes her interesting in any way. the same goes for all the other new characters, and all the original characters have been completely ruined, reduced to failures, and killed off. i will never watch this trilogy again, it is not canon, it serves no purpose, it has no meaning, it is completely incoherent and didn't make me care about any of the characters or any of the so-called ""story"". Kathleen Kennedy, Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams had the opportunity to make something great, but they completely failed. their trilogy is irrelevant and should not be considered part of the Skywalker Saga. all the Skywalkers were killed off, and Mary Sue Palpatine took their name and their home. it's disrespectful to the legacy of STAR WARS and needs to be erased from canon and forgotten.",-0.1362878787878788,0.5743181818181818
2112,"The rise of Skywalker is every single problem in TFA and TLJ time 10 to make the worst Star Wars film to date. While it is a well made movie and all the actors (especially Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, and Ian Mcdiarmid) try their best with what they are given, everything else is an insult. The writing is bogged down by fan service, video game side quests, retreading of the other movies, and trying to undo what the last Jedi did even though that was a way better movie because it at least focused on telling its own story not just trying to please everyone. On top of that, the score is pretty much the same themes we heard over again, the emperors inclusion in general is confusing and unnecessary, Kylo goes back to square one as a wannabe Vader rip off, the visuals while well done are not creative, and the ending is just one big middle finger to the fans by just giving them a unsatisfactory ending. I will defend aspects of force awakens and last Jedi, but this one I can't defend anything in this film.",-0.004249338624338623,0.4348544973544974
