# INST737-Project-
#This project is for INST 737

# Introduction 
Our project focuses on doing a sentiment analysis of user reviews between different Star Wars movies. The movies that this project focused on is Episode 1 to 9 and the user reviews are from Imdb.com. The goal of this project is to provide Disney a comparison of sentiment results between the George Lucas Star Wars films and the Dinsey owned Star Wars films, that way Disney can use this information for future Star Wars movies. This analysis was done using python and this repository contains all of the files related to this project. This includes a project document that explains the results/findings of our project, python notebooks used for the analyis, and .csv files that contain the datasets used. The following sections of this readme will explain the different parts of this repository and information on how to install the required python libraries.
